# connection between question, answer and method

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

---

A central theme of Biggs and Büchler's article _Eight Criteria for Practice-Based Research in the Creative and Cultural Industries_ is that practice-research ought to adopt what they call a Situated Position. That is, there should be equal conditions for all types of research, and they are interested in these commonalities. They describe the opposing position -- that practice-research should be "granted special criteria and regulations"[@biggs_eight_2008 p.6] -- as the Isolationist Position.

Their Situated Position becomes clear in their discussion of the third of four criteria for academic research: _method_.

In this diagram Biggs and Büchler reveal the inter-relational nature of questions, methods and responses (or answers): 

>if one is interested in this particular question, then a particular route would be appropriate in order to find out something or develop the interpretation of this issue and precipitate a meaningful outcome.[@biggs_eight_2008 p.10]

In other words, there is an iterative or cyclical nature between questions, method and answers. Certain conditions and types for each _afford_ certain possibilities in a research project. 

Their Situated Position is represented by the placement of _knowledge_ in the diagram, and how it traverses both specialised and general academic audiences. In other words, the conditions for research in practice-research ought also to be recognisable to researchers working in other (non-artistic research) fields.

_thoughts & links:_

- I like the simplicity of their use of the word 'answers' but I tend to think the word 'claims' is more appropriate in practice-research
- [[specialist and generalist audience in practice-research]] -- for rationale behind Situated Position
- my sense is that it's common in PaR for students to start with an assumed method they call practice-research (or whatever version of the name is most common or fashionable): "I'm a PaR student". Imagine hearing someone say "I'm a scientific method student". This is even more curious given that PaR is not a singular method, and nor do its researchers "follow a single specific or dominant model of enquiry, as happens in other subjects".[@biggs_eight_2008 p.11] ... 
- if you were to start a research project with an overly large circle representing "method", then what does that do to the nature of the questions that might emerge? And what does it in turn do to the nature of the contribution, findings or _claims_ of one's research? These circles -- question, answer and method -- are inter-dependent and the conditions and size of each circle influences the others
