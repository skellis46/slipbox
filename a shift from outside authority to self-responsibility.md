# a shift from outside authority to self-responsibility

_previous note:_ [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]

> Historically and philosophically, community practice shares common ground with the integration of applied somatic movement education within university dance curricula.9 Both strands are deeply influenced by ‘ecosomatic perspectives’ and actively shaped through a pedagogical concern for the ‘decentralization of decision-making’ and ‘a shift from outside authority to self-responsibility’ (Enghauser 2007; Eddy 2002b: 47).[@williamson-2009-formative p.30]

- by community practice Williamson means Somatic Movement Dance Educators in community and client-based practices
- fascinated by implications of this statement in relation to trust of science (as an 'outside authority')
