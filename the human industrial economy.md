# the human industrial economy

_previous note:_ [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]]

Alan Jacobs refers to the writer and activist Paul Kingsnorth's concept of the human industrial economy as "technopoly conceived in relation to the whole of the natural order."[@jacobs-2021-tech p.28] 

Kingsnorth himself has two guides:

> Any action which hinders the advance of the human industrial economy is an ethical action, provided it does not harm life.[@kingsnorth-2019-life n.pag]

> Any action which knowingly and needlessly advances the human industrial economy is an unethical action.[@kingsnorth-2019-life n.pag]
