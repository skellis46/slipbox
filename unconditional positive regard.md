# unconditional positive regard

> "People also nurture our growth by being accepting—by offering us what Rogers called unconditional positive regard," explains David G. Meyers in his book _Psychology: Eighth Edition in Modules_. "This is an attitude of grace, an attitude that values us even knowing our failings. It is a profound relief to drop our pretenses, confess our worst feelings, and discover that we are still accepted. In a good marriage, a close family, or an intimate friendship, we are free to be spontaneous without fearing the loss of others' esteem." <https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-unconditional-positive-regard-2796005>


> All high-quality connections share some common characteristics. First, they involve what Carl Rogers referred to as “unconditional positive regard.” Each person in the relationship feels seen and cared about and feels safe expressing a full range of experiences and thoughts. According to psychologist Lance Sandelands, high-quality connections create a feeling of “living presence, a state of pure being, in which isolating worries, vanities and desires vanish within a single vital organism.”[@kaufman-2020-transcend n.pag.]
