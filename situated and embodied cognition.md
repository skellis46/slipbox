# situated and embodied cognition

Stumbled across [Kate McCallum's PhD work "Situating Mathematical Communication"](https://katiemccallumdotnet.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/situating-mathematical-communication-corrections.pdf) while looking for van Gelder's work on perception-action couplings ([[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]]). In this quote she calls on Noë's work:

> A challenge to this assumption [cognition as a purely internal phenomenon] has arisen and gained momentum in the situated cognition paradigm, a research programme of the last few decades that views cognition as importantly comprised of a whole person’s actions in and interactions with the world. Proponents include Andy Clark, Edwin Hutchins and Alva Noë, the latter of whom summarised his position in particularly succinct form: ‘to understand consciousness in human and animals, we must look not inward, into the recesses of our insides; rather, we need to look to the ways in which each of us, as a whole animal, carries on the processes of living in and with and in response to the world around us’ (Noë, 2009 p.7). The research programme is known as dealing with the mind as embodied, embedded, enactive and extended, from which come the terms ‘4E’ or ‘E-turn’, and the terms ‘situated’ or ‘grounded’ are often used. I will default to the simple term ‘situated cognition’ to refer to the broad movement.[@mccallum-2020-situating p.35]

That Noë citation is from _[Out of Our Heads](x-devonthink-item://862E4140-BE38-4B24-92CC-CF329937C950)_. 
On the next page in her PhD McCallum turns to Andy Clark's work.

_thoughts & links:_

- truly fascinating the ways in which the word _situated_ versus _embodied_ create such different ways (or even politics) of comprehending the idea that we think beyond our brains. 
- this is a stretch, but seems absurdly curious to me that cognition as purely internal versus extended or situated (or embodied) mirrors how I've described the role of the artefact in #practice-research as being either intrinsic or extrinsic. See [[valorising vagueness#^ac1336]]. 
- Also, the purely internal cognition sits very strongly with our sense of the individual (and skin as a barrier or edge of the self). See here Kabat-Zinn describing the "packaged body": [[the species that knows and knows that it knows#^430821]] and my note at end of that zettel. ^43d692
- perhaps also [[a border is not a boundary]] regarding previous point. Also in [[network self and social identities]] and use of word 'container' ^4c3eae
