# we are breathing the same air

_previous note:_ [[the circulation of oxygen]]

> We are all breathing the same air, between your lips, in your nostrils, in your throat, in your chest, behind your ribs, in your diaphragm, your lungs, in your belly: we all breathe in our own way but this air will never be solely ours.[@brown-2020-hau p.77]

There is tension here in how we are together (or collected) and how there are [[other ways to perceive the sky, air and atmosphere]] (also from Brown and Reihana-Morunga). I remain fascinated by this oscillation between what separates us and what binds us. Perhaps the extent to which we focus on being different or the same is a powerful window through which we understand and inhabit the world. See also [[Sennett - Together|tribalism]] and how it "couples solidarity with others like yourself to aggression against those who differ."[@sennett-2012-together p.3]
