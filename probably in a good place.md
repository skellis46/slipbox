# probably in a good place

_previous note:_ [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]

In Daniel Pink's slightly flimsy book _When: the Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing_, there's a section called _When to Quit a Job: A Guide_. 

Point 3 – _Does your boss allow you to do your best work?_  – goes as follows:

> In his excellent book _Good Boss, Bad Boss_: _How to Be the Best . . . and Learn from the Worst_, Stanford Graduate School of Business professor Robert Sutton explains the qualities that make someone worth working for. If your boss has your back, takes responsibility instead of blaming others, encourages your efforts but also gets out of your way, and displays a sense of humor rather than a raging temper, you’re probably in a good place. If your boss is the opposite, watch out—and maybe get out.

I like the way that Sutton is avoiding the 'weeds' of the politics of a place. Rather, he's considering quite basic things that I suspect apply regardless of the kind of work one does. 

By the way, there is no way in hell my boss is reading this blog post but if she were I would let her know that she does all of these things very well indeed. I'm probably in a good place.

_thoughts:_ the link with [[borgmann, effort and focal things]] is tentative or slight, but I made a simple connection with the burden of labour, and getting over the burden.
