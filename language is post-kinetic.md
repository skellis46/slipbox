# language is post-kinetic

_previous note:_  [[without symbolic mediation]]

---

Sheets-Johnstone begins with the simplest observation that "movement is at the core of life".[@sheets-johnstone_why_2010 p.2] Infants are not pre-linguistic; rather, _language is post-kinetic_. She equates movement to the feeling and experience of aliveness, and states that "movement is indeed life-proclaiming"[@sheets-johnstone_why_2010 p.3]

_questions & thoughts:_

- I don't know of any other writer who makes such a compelling case for why movement matters
- I continue to flirt between two lines: the power and value of language, and the spirit and centrality of movement (including moving image) in how we understand and make sense of the world
- [[Sheets-Johnstone - Why Is Movement Therapeutic?]]
- [[human experience and language]]  
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
- idea that language is post-kinetic sits very tightly with [[4e cognition]] and [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]]
