# every experience is modification of awareness

_previous note:_ [[there is no boundary between awareness of experience and experience itself]]

> Meditation is nothing more than the recognition of awareness. We tend to imagine that awareness is inside of us, and the world is outside. But just look with your open eyes. Everything you see is a modification of awareness. As a matter of experience, there is no inside and outside. Everything is in the same place. What you take to be a world, and your body in it, and thoughts, emotions, your mood ... the amazing truth and it's the truth of your very being, is that you have never noticed, even for an instance, anything outside of awareness.
