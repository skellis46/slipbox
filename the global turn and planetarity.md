# the global turn and planetarity

_previous note:_[[ancestry is not a lineage]]

> The “global turn” toward time is actually discussed above: the theorization of a time unique to capital on a global scale, and the possibilities of its refusal, fracturing, or deterritorialization. Yet the global turn takes different forms. It includes ecocriticism, new materialist theories, and posthumanisms that redefine time on a global or even cosmic scale. This global turn rests in part on redefining “globalization” within the frame of the Anthropocene or as part of “planetarity” (a social model that understands time as structured by the needs of living systems, ecologically entwined).[@burges-2016-introduction p.14]
