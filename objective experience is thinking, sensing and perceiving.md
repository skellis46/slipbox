# objective experience is thinking, sensing and perceiving

_previous note:_ [[sensation, attention, awareness, perception, action and feeling]]

> Our objective experience consists of thoughts and images, which we call the mind; sensations, which we call the body; and sense perceptions, which we call the world. In fact we do not experience a mind, a body or a world as such. We experience thinking, sensing and perceiving. [@spira-2008-transparency n.pag.]

Wonder how this sits with the difference between [[interoception]] and [[proprioception]] and exteroception. Same question here about the [difference between a sensation and a perception](https://keydifferences.com/difference-between-sensation-and-perception.html#google_vignette):

> in the case of sensation, we donâ€™t have to engage in the occurrence of the process actively, whereas perception is the interpretation of the information received through sensations.

This is also useful: <https://open.maricopa.edu/psy101/chapter/sensation-and-perception/>:

> There is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention. Attention plays a significant role in determining what is sensed versus what is perceived. 

These things: sensation, perception and attention seem different from awareness as described in [[every experience is modification of awareness]].


Contrast/compare this with [[I never catch myself]].
