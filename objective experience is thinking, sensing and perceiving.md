# objective experience is thinking, sensing and perceiving

_previous note:_ [[sensation, attention, awareness, perception, action and feeling]]


> Our objective experience consists of thoughts and images, which we call the mind; sensations, which we call the body; and sense perceptions, which we call the world. In fact we do not experience a mind, a body or a world as such. We experience thinking, sensing and perceiving. [@spira-2008-transparency n.pag.]
