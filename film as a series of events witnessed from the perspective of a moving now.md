# film as a series of events witnessed from the perspective of a moving now

_previous note:_ [[tensed time as moving or fixed]]

> Although born of experiments that might have led the medium in radically different directions, film in the early years of the twentieth century began exploring its ability to re-create time as we experience it—that is, as a series of events witnessed from the perspective of a moving now.[@gardner-2016-serial p.163]

- to what extent in [[footfall]] might I be able to have collections of time frames present? Not only within the timelapses themselves, but also in how the whole film moves through time. I'm imagining a kind of [[meanwhile time and parallel editing]] across different timelapses of the same topic/look (multiple moving skies) for instance. Perhaps it gives allusion of either being the same day, or completely different days ... time moving within the inner frames, and time moving within the overall frame.
