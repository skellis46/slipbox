# seeing as exchange with the world

_previous note:_ [[noë - strange tools]]

---

Noë's thinking in _Strange Tools_ is based on the idea that, at a certain level, humans are organised. This level is not the level of the nervous system, or the level of "conscious, deliberate action."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 1. Getting Organised, n.p.] Rather, it is an "embodiment level", that Noë has taken from the work of roboticist Dana Ballard.

>Our lives are one big complex nesting of organized activities at different levels and scales. Talking, walking, eating, perceiving, driving. We are always captured by structures of organization. This is our natural, indeed our biological, condition. It is the basic fact about us.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 1. Getting Organised, n.p.]

He writes that these organisational structures are not of our own making, but at the same time we aren't at their mercy. Our agency as human beings is tied up in how we participate in various practices (like walking, eating, perceiving and driving).

Noë understands seeing, when viewed from the "right level of description" as being such an organised activity or practice. 

>Seeing [...] is a temporally extended, dynamic exchange with the world around us, one that is guided by principles of timing, thoughtfulness, movement, spontaneity, function, and pleasure, like those we see in operation when we drive or walk or breast-feed, but that are also governed by all manner of learned understandings and expectations and engagements with this or that task ... [@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 1. Getting Organised, n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- I'm fascinated by this dynamic exchange with the world, and how it might be a way to conceive of _epistemic things_ in artistic research. 
- how doe this thinking relation to [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]]?

_consider:_

- taking a look at Dana Ballard and _embodiment level_ in robotics
- [[conversation and understanding]] and the ways in which this dynamic exchange with the world functions epistemically (??)
