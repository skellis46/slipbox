# being beside one's self

_previous note:_ [[losing one's self]]

Link to web page with overview of etymology of being beside oneself: [Beside yourself? Where’s that?](https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2015/03/beside-onerself.html)

> The _OED_ defines the phrase as “out of one’s wits, out of one’s senses,” and compares it to expressions in French (_hors de soi_) and German (_ausser sich_) that mean the same thing.
