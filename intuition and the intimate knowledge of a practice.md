# intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice

_previous note:_ [[preconceptions and the hermeneutic circle]]

---

Sönke Ahrens describes how intuition emerges from the "intimate knowledge of a practice" which in turn makes new insights possible. Such intimacy is born out of profound experience that informs decision-making processes. 

>intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge.[@ahrens_how_2017 Chapter 12.5 n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- curious this phrase "sedimented experience" in that Jonathan Burrows was talking about it the other day (during Research Cafe at C-DaRE on Thursday 18 June 2020), and comparing it with the idea of practice as a form of compost (he preferred sedimentation)
- I'm interested in Ahrens' writing/thinking here because it speaks directly to the nature of practice as a 'method' to generate new understandings. But what it doesn't do is deal with the specifics of creative research. That is, he is implying -- particularly by calling on Rheinberger -- that all research processes are built on practices
- #question -- what is most particularly or unique about creative practice as an approach to new understandings?

_consider:_ 

- Rheinberger, Hans-Jörg. 1997. Toward a History of Epistemic Things: Synthesizing Proteins in the Test Tube. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press
- [[device paradigm and focal things]]
- [[search for truth]] -- speaks directly to my question above; that is: imagination and experience
- [[shifting focus and scanning]] -- how is noticing detail different from noticing difference (or becoming differently aware?)
