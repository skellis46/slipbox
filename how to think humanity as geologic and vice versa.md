# how to think humanity as geologic and vice versa

_previous note:_ [[saeculum]]

> Enter the Anthropocene.
> The latest buzzword in environmental discourse, “Anthropocene” accentuates humanity and planet as interdigitating concepts of time.5 It designates an epoch in which human activities, such as releasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere, substantially alter geophysical systems. The concept makes of humans the modifiers of the planet itself—ratios of atmospheric compounds, surface air temperature, mass species migration—and not only of its land and seas. If in Braudel’s vivid formulation, “[e]ach social reality secretes its own peculiar time, or time scale, like common snails,” then current climate reality secretes a many-layered shell.6 The time concept of the Anthropocene is both popular and controversial because it engenders complex time problems of the sort Niedecker pondered: how to think humanity as geologic and vice versa.

> Scholars within the humanities have studied conditions contributing to the Anthropocene for decades, but Dipesh Chakrabarty’s 2009 article “The Climate of History: Four Theses” sent the concept echoing through academic halls.12 [@houser-2016-human p.147]

Footnote 12 from Houser: 
> Chakrabarty, “The Climate of History,” 197. See also Chakrabarty, “Postcolonial Studies and the Challenge of Climate Change,” New Literary History 43, no. 1 (2012): 1–18. Other historians and theorists, notably Richard White and Slavoj Žižek, have challenged the newness, or the nowness, of Chakrabarty’s theses. See White, “Does Global Climate Change Change History?” (response to paper presented by Dipesh Chakrabarty at the Environmental Humanities Project, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, April 20, 2010); and Slavoj Žižek, Living in the End Times (London: Verso, 2010).
