# two women dancing

## two girls dancing and lockdown

They are two young women, perhaps 14 or 15 years old. They are playing together in a common (or park) in early March 2021 during the UK's second national lockdown. I am walking past, wary of watching or intruding, but also captivated by what they are doing. 

They are dancing for each other; or, each of them is dancing for the other who is recording the dancing on a smartphone held in portrait mode. The camera and the dancer are close to each other; it's a close-up. They take turns dancing or recording, then watching the short dance together, pointing at the small screen, and laughing freely and loudly. 

The dancing itself is mostly movement in the head and neck; a kind of rolling or looping of the head side to side around the transverse axis. It's very specific, and it is playfully performed. As a trio -- two women and a camera -- they are lost in their own world; enamoured with the game. The movement or sequence is pretty much the same short length every time, as if they are trying to perfect the performance of the moves, or perfect the recording of the performances. 

From the outside (well, this is all from the outside really), their game (like so many open-ended games) seems to be on repeat. Even the repetition of the movement has a quality of being able to be reversed, repeated or played back. Each dance is exquisitely brief, and not linear or forward seeking. There's a visual glitch in their matrix as they play. 

By then I'm way past where they are playing ... and even to here I've projected an enormous amount onto what they were doing. 

The park or common is part of a series of commons not far from where I live. It's not _nature_ as such but it's close enough to feel like they have unwittingly fallen into the trope of screendance recorded in nature (ref).

I'm taking my permitted one hour of outdoor exercise.

This screendance is only happening in this way because of these technologies. Variations have happened in the past (I'm remembering how we had to stay silent while recording ABBA from the TV) -- dancing, watching, dancing. But this instance. This thing. is very different. 

What is the "new" behaviour here? Anything to do with screendance?

Harmony's paper on Gutenberg press? [bench-2015-digital.pdf]
What is the new tool in this exchange? It isnt dancing. It isnt recording devices? Is it the social software - tic toc
they are playing. but the technology is also playing them? infinite game ... but with a brutal construction? Heidegger's standing reserve. See p.31 of [jacobs-2021-from]. They become standing reserve for tic toc. But I don't want to see it in this way. This is the finite game we are all playing. 

## technologies afford behaviours

Affordances . Gibson. Technologies afford behaviours 
- two perspectives; one is what is afforded by the interaction and indeed the technology. Technologies afford behaviours. 

>It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]

- second perspective is very wide-angle. no longer necessary to take stewardly care. See <jacobs-2021-from.pdf> and in particular this discussion of Gerd-Günter Voß
- can make something of the two girls in nature ... the trees, the green grass. Then consider our relationship to nature in, for example, <Gerd-Günter Voß's three conducts of life.md> (Zettel)

>The particular tone of the sage’s skepticism is ironic, and the sage is in some essential sense an ironist, but his irony is always directed primarily toward himself. Indeed, this is precisely why people should seek him out to govern them: His primary qualification for office is the gently humor- ous attitude he takes toward himself, which then extends outward toward our technological “enframing” of the world. [@jacobs-2021-tech p.40]

- thinking here of the tone of my voice in this writing. What wt t would it be like to smile at the tech and ignore it in this case? To write a section dealing with the mess of nature/stewardly care, but then to ask the reader to ignore it. That that section is a version of myself that is more troubling, less important. Worth ignoring, or perhaps, at best, just smiling at. Can I mock the tech? 

>And the fact that cosmotechnics, as I noted earlier, can be generally described but only locally instantiated makes room for a great deal of creative adaptation.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.41]

- thinking here about the girls' dancing as a local instantiation. But this is compromised by what I imagine is the end game -- posting to tic tok.
