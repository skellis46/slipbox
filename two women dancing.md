# Lithium dancing (hidden in plain sight)

- think through [[moral and ethical implications of our tools]] as overview of my thinking in this writing—as a way of narrowing its focus (or perhaps a question at the start of each section?)

## Abstract

- going to circle along away from the centre.

---

 >the outside world, the non-digital world, is merely a theatrical space in which one stages and records content for the much more real, much more vital digital space.
 
 -- Bo Burnham [-@burnham-2021-inside n.pag]

> Here indeed, the whole mechanism of the operation is invisible to the viewer: the deepest darkness reigns: suddenly, a ghost appears, far, far away at first, appearing as a point of light to the audience. But it soon grows, becomes bigger and bigger and seems to approach slowly at first, to then rush towards the spectators: the illusion is total.

-- Victor de Moléon (1836) [in @chateau-2016-screensa pp.49-50]
 
## Two young people and their camera

_In which I describe an actual event that prompted this thinking-writing._

I am out for a walk during my one hour of permitted outdoor exercise. It is March 2021 and we are nearing the end of the strictest part of the UK's second national lockdown. 

They are two young people, perhaps 15 years old, playing together in a park, or what is called a common. The area is not nature as such but it is also definitely not the city. 

I am walking past them, wary of watching or intruding, but also captivated by their play. They are dancing for each other. Or rather, one of them is dancing for the other who is recording the dancing on a smartphone held in portrait mode. The camera and the dancer are close to each other; it is a close-up. They take turns: they dance, record, watch, point at the screen, and laugh.

The dancing is mostly movement in the head and neck; rolling the head side to side around the frontal axis. They more or less do the same short sequence every time, as if they are trying to perfect the performance of the moves, or the recording of the performances. This trio of two young people and a smartphone are deep in their own world. Their game seems to be on repeat. The movement has a quality of being able to be reversed, repeated, or played back. Each dance is exquisitely brief, and not linear or forward seeking. It is as if there is a visual glitch in their matrix.

By this stage I am some way past where it is they are dancing. It has been no more than three minutes since I first saw them. 

## An assumption about what happened next

_In which I introduce the central conceit (or assumption) of this article, the structure, and how any discussion of technology is a discussion about economics._

In Volume 11 of IJSD—_Expanded Screendance_—Katrina McPherson noted Douglas Rosenberg's description of screendance as "the most invasive of all arts species" that "has been hiding in plain site since well before there was a critical mass of interest in the form, even before it was named as such."[Rosenberg, in @mcpherson-2020-walking p.55] Then, Volume 12 of IJSD—_This is where we dance now: COVID-19 and the new and next in dance onscreen_—acknowledged and celebrated screendance's undeniable visibility as people danced and watched dancing through screens during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdowns. In that same issue, Elena Benthaus described feeling "wary"[@benthaus-2021-this p.283] that screendance was somehow hidden before the virus acted as a great revealer, and outlined how dance fads have long been "circulated by Hollywood musicals and dance films" and TV shows.[@benthaus-2021-this p.283; see also @bench-2020-perpetual p.10]

These descriptions of the practices of screendance being variously hidden, revealed, circulated, and invasive are telling in how those of us interested in screendance narrate or construct its history and practices. Something will always be hiding (in plain sight) if there isn't yet a name for it, or the desire to do that naming. When we name or attach a label to anything we render it visible. 

This writing is not about the kind of hiding that speaks of screendance's uncertainty about itself and desire for recognition. Instead, it is an attempt to understand what I could not see when I happened across those two young people making dances for their smartphone, and how mechanisms and narratives of _hiding_ might matter to those of us who create screendances. 

These two young people were dancing in plain sight while recording their movement, but it's not possible to know with any certainty _why_ they were recording their dancing. The assumption on which this writing rests is that what I saw that day was not the the full story; that what they did next or soon after was to post the _best version_ of their screendance performances _on social_. I think this assumption is plausible and warranted because, as Harmony Bench suggests, it is "difficult if not impossible to separate dance in public from social media in an era when the latter are determining forces of contemporary social life and engagement."[-@bench-2020-perpetual p.65] 

My assumption effectively renders these two young people as representations or proxies; they stand in for all humans recording their dancing and uploading it to social media, not solely teenagers doing the same thing. People dance, record their dancing, and upload those recordings to social media; and we do all of these things routinely. Volume 12 of IJSD is testimony to the fact that social media technologies are cultural levers and patterns deeply embedded in screendance practices.[e.g. @blancoborelli-2021-tiktok; @benthaus-2021-this] 

I am agnostic towards social media platforms, but given how much dancing is happening on TikTok[e.g. @blancoborelli-2021-tiktok; @harlig-2021-tiktok; @dexter-2021-dance] I will assume that this was their social media of choice.

## Algorithmic choreography

_In which I ... _

> embedded in every tool is an ideological bias, a predisposition to construct the world as one thing rather than another, to value one thing over another, to amplify one sense or skill or attitude more loudly than another.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.13]

In _TikTok and Short-Form Screendance Before and After Covid_ the internet anthropologist Crystal Abidin describes how TikTok shapes you "to create content in specific ways", and is "squishing you into a template and teaching you how to perform creativity within a box."[in @harlig-2021-tiktok p.192] If these two people on the common during lockdown—or anyone for that matter—set out to make algorithmically inspired screendance it would likely look like the dancing they were doing, and be shot with the smartphone they were using. I saw their movement-performances-on-repeat without the need to _scroll_ or _refresh_, and I can imagine their video likenesses on a small screen: the framing, dancing, music, and virtual stickers, and the desire to share and be seen.

I suspect though that they did not set out to make a screendance the way IJSD readers might understand an _intention_ to make a screendance. Rather, the screendance was more made _on_ them, and without them being aware of—nor probably caring about—the coercion. Who is doing the choreography here? These are ways of moving shaped by a machine that doesn't see how these young people are dancing, it doesn't need to. It is not an all-seeing machine of an invisible state. Rather, it is a commercial machine that has "blown by the panopticon"[Zuboff, in @farrell-2017-shoshana n.pag.] There is no _outside_ because it is not an institutional building, and there is "no zone of life that is not being infiltrated."[Zuboff, in @farrell-2017-shoshana n.pag.] These two dancing people were being directed by an invasive all-seeing sightless machine that carries the "colonizing forces of algorithmic logic."[@morrison-2019-algorithms p.10]

But it's not so dystopic is it? After all, this machine was programmed by humans. The algorithms—opinions "formalized in code"[@oneil-2016-weapons Chapter 3: Arms Race, n.pag]—were created by _someone_, probably more than one person: a cloud of choreographers-as-developers; unseen, hidden. American author/blogger Seth Godin writes, "The folks with the power are the anonymous engineers, tweaking algorithms without clear awareness of what the impact might be."[@godin-2021-tiktok n.pag.] It is improbable that those software developers could ever imagine how their code in Kotlin, Java, Swift or Objective C would prescribe the way these two people were dancing. 

At the same time, I do not want to overestimate the sophistication of their mathematics; very few data points are required for us to reveal ourselves through social media. The Wall Street Journal has found that although shares, likes, follows and the things you watch play a role in determining one's FYP (For You Page) on TikTok, the platform needs only one piece of data to "figure you out": "how long you linger over a piece of content."[@wallstreetjournal-2021-how n.pag.] We will always linger over the things that attract our attention, whether we are in public or whatever remains of the private. 

## Being in (the) economic common

_In which I _

In 2000, the Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman described a liquid-modern society in which the balance has tilted from the societal improvement for the common good and heavily "towards the self-assertion of the individual."[@bauman-2000-liquid p.29] In liquid modernity, the public sphere has become one of the "many spoils of deregulation, privatization, individualization, of the conquest and annexation of the public by the private."[@bauman-2008-does p.28]

These two young people were in a public sphere that in the UK is called a common. Such spaces are owned privately, or by local councils or the National Trust. They have simple and reasonably relaxed rules, and are protected, cared for, and open. They are one of few areas in the UK not overwhelmed by CCTV. Yet within this particular public space on that day in March 2021, the public dances performed by these two people were annexed by privately owned algorithms. This public-private paradox of the commons is a direct part of what social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism, that deploys "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others' ends".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1] The purpose of these hidden extractive operations is to predict our future behaviors and to sell those predictions to advertisers. This mostly hidden economy functions because data and advertising now rule the world's economy.[@noauthor-2017-world] 

In _Perpetual Motion: Dance, Digital Cultures, and the Common_ (2020) Harmony Bench describes and analyzes the role of digital technologies in the global proliferation and circulation of dances. She writes that "regardless of whether gestures should circulate freely across moving bodies, they most certainly do."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.160] Bench uses Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's idea of the common as being more than simply a shared resource (like in the shared _common_ outdoor spaces here in the UK). Instead, Hardt and Negri's common is produced socially and is essential for social interaction and ongoing production. Bench writes how "ideas, customs, and practices that are collectively generated and make it possible to live together"[@bench-2020-perpetual p.5] are examples of Hardt and Negri's _artificial_ common (as distinct from the _natural_ commons of limited resources). 

In the book, Bench expresses a delicate ambivalence in describing the digital commons in dance. She articulates the ideologies and conflicts at play in how dance snowballs and circulates, while acknowledging that individuals generate belonging and community through digital circulations of movement. These circulations of gestures are, according to Bench, "assertions of dance as common,"[@bench-2020-perpetual p.9] and it is digital contexts—or more precisely "technologically enabled decontextualization"[@bench-2020-perpetual p.160]—that generate the conditions for dancers to create a movement culture in common and to feel as if they belong. Bench is also clear that she does not suggest this movement culture in common is an "an antidote to cultural appropriation or capitalist expropriation."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.160] 

There are two words Bench uses—and that I have quoted above—that interest me. The first is _assertions_, and the second is _decontextualization_. They interest me because to decontextualise gestures and movements from _everything_ privileges and "repackages ideologies of freedom and universal access",[@bench-2020-perpetual p.8] and creates the conditions to _assert_ being in common. That is, technologies of decontextualization generate the necessary distance, invisibility, and absence to make possible the production, reproduction, and circulation of gestures that in turn serve the pursuit of belonging (and being seen to belong) in common. 

I wonder though what those two young people in the common were really asserting. Even while (hypothetically) distributing and circulating their public dancing, these two young people were certainly not creating content for some innocent digital commons. I worry that to call this space in the cloud a _common_—particularly given the word's idiomatic meaning—implicitly trivializes or glosses over the powerful technocratic mechanisms at play, including in some simple dancing between two young people and their smartphone. 

For all that Bench so beautifully and diplomatically articulates, my sense is that she leans towards the circulation of dancing through the digital commons as being a good thing for dance. The implication is that the circulation and proliferation of humans in motion in the digital common creates positive externalities; that is, by definition, benefits to the public good not mediated through the market. But what of negative externalities? What kind of effluent is created by our digital dancing commons and who eventually pays for it, and when, and how? Even given the implicit or explicit value of the circulation and proliferation of gestures in the digital common, it is worth remembering that all technologies—including those of social media—are developments "largely oriented economically to profit-making"[@weber-1978-economy Part 1, p.67] and that "technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action."[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1.V The Puppet Master, Not the Puppet: n.pag.] In other words, when we dance with technologies, we dance with profit-making, and perhaps now we are only ever dancing with technologies.

In 1993, the technology skeptic Neil Postman coined a word, technopoly, which he describes as "the submission of all forms of cultural life to the sovereignty of technique and technology."[@postman-1993-technopoly p.52] Postman describes technopoly as totalitarian technocracy because it "eliminates alternatives to itself"[@postman-1993-technopoly p.48] by rendering them invisible. Technopoly is a way of culture and thinking in which no matter the question, the answer is technology. Yet, when there is only one answer, the nature of the questions we ask inevitably changes and we create loops of recursion that are both frightening and fascinating.[@turkle-2021-empathy] 

## Myth and the right to a future tense

_and call on Alan Jacobs' understanding of the value of myth in the technopoly._

In 2019, the humanities scholar Alan Jacobs wrote an essay called _After Technopoly_ and, like much of his thinking, it calls attention to the power and value of myth making. Jacobs describes how technopoly "arises from the technological core of society but produces people who are driven and formed by the mythical core."[@jacobs_after_2019 p.4] Jacobs' thinking about the mythical core is based on the work of the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski. The mythical core represents those of us "who practice moral life by habits of affection, not by rules."[@jacobs_after_2019 p.4] For Kołakowski, the mythical core of culture is those experiences that are not able to be manipulated because they are "prior to our instrumental reasoning about our environment."[@jacobs-2019-after p.3] In other words, the mythical core—a way of experiencing "nonempirical unconditioned reality"[Kołakowski, in @jacobs-2019-after p.3]—is unable to be pressed into the logic of technology no matter our rational capacities. For Jacobs, the mythical core is a way out of the recursive loop of the technopoly.

This interplay between rationalism and myth is a key aspect of Jacobs' ongoing thinking. He argues that technocratic rationalism cannot be avoided but rather transcended: "that there is something better, not in opposition to it, but on the other side of it. Something that will in time emerge."[@jacobs-2019-after p.13] This all sounds so easy, perhaps even quaint, but Jacobs also warns that the place for transcending technopoly will be "a hidden place" because if transnational technopoly can hunt you down and root you out, it will; and it probably can.[@jacobs-2019-after p.13]

In _Surveillance Capitalism_ Shoshana Zuboff also talks about hiding, and her thinking is similarly bleak when it comes to the future. She writes of the terrible danger that we become accustomed to either life without privacy or the necessity to hide from being seen. She suggests that both alternatives—total transparency or hiding underground—"rob us of the life-sustaining inwardness, born in sanctuary, that finally distinguishes us from the machines."[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 17.III Every Unicorn Has a Hunter n.pag.] Her perspective is that surveillance capitalism has compromised "our elemental right to the future tense"[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.VI The Power of the Unprecedented: A Review, n.pag.]. This is the right to make moral decisions free from forces that modify and exploit our behavior, and that function beyond our awareness.

## Hidden in the future

> [The Robber Barons'] greatest achievement was in convincing their countrymen that the future need have no connection to the past.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.54]

> On a long enough timeline, everything becomes obsolete.[@millburn-2021-love n.pag.] 

_In which I zoom out long into the future to remember a screendance and consider what it might mean for those of us here in the present who make screendances._

The American writer Stewart Brand proposes that there are "six significant levels of pace and size in the working structure of a robust and adaptable civilization".[@brand-2008-clock p.36] From "fast and attention-getting to slow and powerful"[@brand-2008-clock p.36] the six levels are: fashion/art, commerce, infrastructure, governance, culture and nature. Brand writes how the role of fashion and art is essentially to be "quick, irrelevant, engaging, self-preoccupied, and cruel"[@brand-2008-clock p.36] whereas the "vast slow-motion dance"[@brand-2008-clock p.38] of culture operates through centuries and millennia. Brand suggests that together these distinct and contradictory pace layers provide internal negative feedback that stabilizes and affords the health of civilization. 

So now I'm going to attempt to zoom out in time to the pace of _culture_ according to Brand's levels. It is a level or place where time as chronos operates akin to Danny Hillis' _10,000-year clock_ or _The Clock of the Long Now_.[@hillis-1995-millennium] [^ack1] 

[^ack1]: I first read of Hillis' work in Brian Eno's _A Year with Swollen Appendices_ (1995), but was reminded of his work (and Stewart Brand's) while reading Douglas Rushkoff's book _Present Shock_ (2013). This is to acknowledge their influence on this section of the article.

Those two young people have grown up, lived their lives and are gone. They are probably survived by family, but maybe not. I am long dead. Perhaps the park is still there? It is common land so hopefully it has not been developed; but I am doubtful. There are parts of the teenagers' phones from 2021 that are still on the planet in some form: lithium, copper, gold, lead, zinc, etc; elemental fragments of devices that once afforded some public dancing back in 2021 during the pandemic that is almost forgotten. For the most part these elements are in landfill. Those software companies that wielded algorithms to reach through the smartphone to choreograph that dancing are long gone too; I can no longer remember their names. They were once so certain and stable; omnipresent. Their algorithms disappeared with them, and have been replaced by old mathematics rethought and recompiled. 

I feel none of the vertigo that American media theorist Douglas Rushkoff suggested I might feel if I were to zoom so far out.[-@rushkoff-2013-present] But _he_ was writing in 2013, so what would he know? 

I notice the stillness and slowness, and the absence of sniping chatter. In that stillness I remember seeing a screendance by Annie Pfingst and Helen Poynor called _in Memoriam_ that was first screened in 2016.[-@poynor-2016-memoriam] I saw it at the Light Moves Festival of Screendance in 2018; such a long time ago. This is a film that—according to Brand's thinking—is the scale of art operating at the pace of nature.[@brand-2008-clock] The film is kryptonite to the digital social platforms that people once used. In the film a single figure inhabits densely forested areas through different seasons. I don't remember there being much movement in the body; indeed my key memory is of the tapestry of the terrain, and of the passing of time. But that was no ordinary time that was passing, even under the machinations and co-ordinates of the long now.[@hillis-1995-millennium] [^ack1] 

[^ack1]: I first read of Hillis' work in Brian Eno's _A Year with Swollen Appendices_ (1995), but was reminded of his work (and Stewart Brand's) while reading Douglas Rushkoff's book _Present Shock_ (2013). This is to acknowledge their influence on this section of the article. 

_in Memoriam_ is—or is it _was_?—a film that treasures myth and seems to resist and transcend technopoly. It is a film in a _hidden place_ in plain sight. It is unable to be rooted out, even as the dancer Helen Poynor is enmeshed in the roots of trees and of nature. It exists through its edit and feel in an _other_ time akin to kairos.

Here, as I write, long into the future, some uncountable years after the screening in Limerick, it seems that it is no mere coincidence that the film was shot in an Iron Age fort; an ancient place of protection, a place by which we recognize the slowness of culture, and the creep of nature. A place where others like us sought shelter, protection and safety. It is, after all, worth remembering that the feeling of safety makes it possible for us to "dare to choose the unknown."[@maslow-2011-psychology p.67]   

_in Memoriam_ is the kind of screendance that recognizes and understands modes of production and presentation, and pursues alternate tastes, pace, and time. It is grounded in making and process yet somehow manages to avoid the feeling that it was designed for consumption. How can that be? What sleight of hand is at play? (to render visible that which must be made invisible)

Around the same time that _in Memoriam_ was being made, the philosopher of technology Yuk Hui[^bob] wrote an article called _Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics_.[-@hui-2017-cosmotechnics] Cosmotechnics is a strange term that describes the "unification of the cosmos and the moral through technical activities, whether craft-making or art making."[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics, p.7] It is as if Hui is reaching back from Postman's technopoly to tool-using cultures. In the article, Hui tells the story of a very good butcher called Pao Ding who claims that having an excellent knife is not enough:

[^bob]: Thanks to Joanne "Bob" Whalley for introducing me to Yuk Hui's book _The Question Concerning Technology in China_[-@hui-2016-question] at around the same time that I stumbled across Alan Jacobs discussing Hui in _From Tech Critique to Ways of Living_.[-@jacobs-2021-tech] 

>it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

Hui writes that when the butcher encounters any difficulty, "he slows down the knife and gropes for the right place to move further."[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.] This is the Dao (or _way_ or _path_), whereas the Qi is the technical/phenomenal object (or "technics"): the knife. 

I like to think that Annie Pfingst and Helen Poynor's sleight of hand was to recognise the utility of the knife as technic, while being busy with the Dao of making. That is, in _in Memoriam_ they unified the cosmos and the moral. 

In this future or the next, screendance emerged out of the rubble of “life versus the machine”[Paul Kingsnorth, in @jacobs-2021-tech p.28] and humankind's dance with the technological singularity. The singularity—which did not end up happening just in case you were wondering—once described the point at which "ever-more-rapid technological change leads to unpredictable consequences".[@chalmers-2010-singularity n.pag.] The technological singularity is the thing that even back in 2017  Hui was calling a pipe dream. At some point in the 21st century screendance simply refused the "homogeneous technological future"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.] that had been presented to humankind as the only option.


## The future common

> As much as networked technology has dismantled and distributed power in more egalitarian ways, it has also extended and obscured power, making it less visible and, arguably, harder to resist.

-- Astra Taylor[in @jacobs-2018-tending n.pag.]

> What was required of the earth so that I might be able to use this technology?Upon what systems, technical or human, does my use of this technology depend? Are these systems just?

_In which I_

I recognize that this writing is a rather curious rollercoaster ride through many sources and many ideas. I worry that what I hope is a strength (traversing broad terrain) will be judged as a weakness. Perhaps some of you are still with me. Perhaps I lost others in making the assumption I did about those two young people doing their lithium dancing in the common.

Certainly, this article is filled with the ambivalence generated by my assumption that what they did next that day in March 2021 was to knowingly _and_ unwittingly participate in a complex techno-choreography of extraction. In many respects I felt and continue to feel something akin to _awe_: "the perception of vastness and the struggle to mentally process the experience."[@kaufman-2020-transcend Chapter 7 Peak Experiences n.pag.] Awe is unusual because it mixes emotions that do not normally reside together. In the case of these two people dancing, I experienced beauty and fear. There was beauty in happening across two human beings dancing together through play; the sense of them being close together and in common, and of their obliviousness and disinterest in being seen. I like to pretend that in that brief moment watching their dance-to-be-screened James Carse's idea of the infinite game came to my mind. This is a game predicated on surprise and in which there is no audience, only players.[@carse-1986-finite] They were making something together, not something to be watched or consumed. Yet I was afraid too. I was afraid of the hidden players and costs—the negative externalities—of that play for their future, and for our future. Perhaps then this writing is an attempt to place that feeling of awe in the context of the work we make and see in the field of screendance. 

Perhaps also the writing reflects my desire to convince readers—particularly those of you who make screendances—that in social media (and the dancing that happens on it) we have acquired a logic of consumption disguised or hidden as a mode of production.[@bauman-2000-liquid] That there is danger in valorizing the making or creativity of these two young people who are proxies for all of us who make screendances to be consumed:

> And it is in our role as producers, not consumers, that we contribute to the common good and win recognition for doing so.[@sandel-2020-tyranny Chapter 7 Recognizing Work, n.pag.]

I am proposing that we must seek methods of making that distill production from consumption; that our work is to pry apart the discombobulating effects of screendancing to be seen, and to do this in plain sight. I understand screendance to be a small enough field—and collection of practices—to interrogate and resist the logic of production predicated on consumption. We have talked about such resistance for years as a community but as dance has become more and more visible on social media, the temptation is to celebrate these days in the sun, and turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs_tending_2018 n.p.] The crash zoom to social media since around the introduction of Facebook's Like button in 2009[@alter-2017-irresistible Chapter 5 Feedback, n.pag.] has made the stakes high and ambiguous for screendance: the promise of being transmitted and seen (finally!) at the cost of extractive consumption and the "immediacy of appropriation":[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

> We need more lithium today, and merely hope to find greater reserves—or a suitable replacement—tomorrow. This revaluation has the effect of shifting the place of the natural order from something intrinsic to our practices to something extrinsic. The whole of nature becomes what economists tellingly call an _externality_.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]
 
It is simply a coincidence that the extraction of lithium plays a key role in the production of our smartphones that themselves are agents and transmitters of extraction and consumption. Perhaps also it is a coincidence that those two young people dancing with and for their smartphone offered a glimpse (in plain sight) of the thin line between that thing intrinsic to their playful practice, and the poison of consumptive virality through social media.

# Edit bin

- no longer necessary to take stewardly care. This seems to relate (slightly) to ideas above re zooming out/long now. See [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]] and in particular his discussion of Gerd-Günter Voß. 

I've long wondered about screendance's fascination with filming dancing in nature. The trees, the green grass. A trope. [[Gerd-Günter Voß's three conducts of life]]

He discusses the work of Hans Jonas -- who was mentored by Heidegger -- and in particular a book called _The Imperative of Responsibility_. One key idea in the book (for Jacobs) is that new technologies demand new ethics; that we cannot rely on old ethical concerns or thinking "because no previous society possessed powers that could extend its reach so far in both space and time."[@jacobs_tending_2018 n.p.] For Jonas we must expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet. Jacobs writes how we can, by and large, deal with the expansion of space through technological means, but that time is more complex or largely ignored: "What force shall represent the future in the present?"[Jonas, in @jacobs_tending_2018 n.p.]

- logic of consumption (see <https://notesread.com/liquid-modernity/> disguised as a mode of production. The danger in valorizing their making—their creativity. 


To recognise that the real struggle for screendance practitioners is not between no-tech analogue dancing and the algorithms of social media platforms, but within the possibilities opened up by this exchange, this social dance, this elemental friendship I witnessed.

Looking into the "possibility of different technological futures" [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^06b080]]—this is really beautiful. That we are aware. Implications for screendance? 


"within the realm of possibilities"[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.301]

"The Anthropocene is the planetarization of standing reserves"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

For Berry, the vital distinction is between projecting and promising: “The ‘projecting’ of ‘futurologists’ uses the future as the safest possible context for whatever is desired; it binds one only to selfish interest. But making a promise binds one to someone else’s future.” It is this distinction that points us toward means of fulfilling Jonas’s “imperative of responsibility.”[@jacobs-2018-tending n.pag.]

What he says here ... _in Memoriam_ does this work. It is not caught in a bubble of screendance; it resists culture. It is heterogenuous. 

- collective as standing reserve?  Connected (not community) - bauman (more like hist [[swarms in liquid modernity]]). Collective as "common". Ambiguity of word common.
- part of the awe is the sense of their dancing being _with_ others. That they are networked—no, this isn't the right word. They are together. Close. Sharing. Seeing and being seen. But see Bauman (<https://notesread.com/liquid-modernity/>) on 'connection'—and how disconnecting becomes so easy.

> While the concepts of awe and wonder have a long history in philosophy and religion, James and Maslow helped bring them to psychology. Today, much of the contemporary investigation of awe stems from a 2003 paper, “Approaching Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” written by Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt.47 The authors argued that there are two main cognitive appraisals that are central to awe experiences: the perception of vastness and the struggle to mentally process the experience. Vastness need not be perceptual, such as seeing the Grand Canyon, but can also be conceptual, such as contemplating eternity. Awe is an unusual and complex emotion because it mixes emotions that don’t tend to go with each other, such as ecstasy and fear.[@kaufman-2020-transcend Chapter 7 Peak Experiences n.pag.]

Can I discuss paradox of the situation in terms of device paradigm and focal things? But what does this all matter for screendance? These are questions of culture: of privacy and freedom. We must make visible. To unhide. To recognise the games that are being played (on us).

- perhaps I am talking about two types of hiding. One is device paradigm/algorithmic. The other is how to respond (based on Jacobs' thinking)??

It is more as if their freedom to play and make was being asserted on them. They have been coerced under the illusion of freedom and play. 

- [[swarms in liquid modernity]]

- commodities might be intangible, but that is forgetting the real economy going on here. It's like watching two fish fight over a piece of bread in a pond that is being poisoned by a landowner for their private good. this isn't quite right. It's more that the fish are producing something that is shared around the pond, but how the pond is constructed shapes how they move, and is poisoning them?? I'm suggesting we must zoom out. That, to squeeze too much out of my metaphor, the bread (the gestures) are inconsequential, and how it is made and squabbled over is a level of dialogue too low.


Surely an artificial common like that composed of the gestures and movements of dancing human-kind is not immune.

But what is it that these women are asserting? They are being asserted. What freedoms are being performed here? I worry that Bench does not grapple with how both sides of her _common_ paradox—belonging and illusions of openness of freedom—are controlled by Big Tech.  See HB below—she hints at this, what might it even mean to 'make' or 'create' something under such conditions? Something is being circulated—and HB deals with this beautifully. 

> In their book Commonwealth, Hardt and Negri note the inadequacy of the commons as both precedent and metaphor for contemporary reinvestments in a cultural commons. They write instead of the common, of which they posit two main types: the “natural” common of limited resources, such as land, air, and water, and the “artificial” common “that resides in languages, images, knowledges, affects, codes, habits, and practices” as well as gestures.8 They define the common as “those results of social production that are necessary for social interaction and further production.”9 Ideas, customs, and practices that are collectively generated and make it possible to live together are exemplars of the artificial common.[@bench-2020-perpetual p.5]

> Whereas Burt posits the commons of contemporary dance, I employ Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s language of the common to distinguish my usage from a default understanding of the commons as a shared resource.[p.5]

... She suggests that what makes dances public "is as much about exposure to onsite spectators (who may not actually be the target audience) as it is about dancing in venues that are available and accessible to the general public."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.64] These kinds of dances in public use the digital commons to circulate and provide audiences.[@bench-2020-perpetual] Need to critique digital commons? Bench's digital commons are distinct from these: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_%28economics%29>; <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Commons_(Elsevier)> (plenty of issues with them: <https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/elsevier-academic-publishing-petition/427059/>)

I understand Bench's premise to be _for better or worse, this is where and how we dance now, so we better get used to it._

> It is not my intention, then, to posit the common of dance as an antidote to cultural appropriation or capitalist expropriation. Instead, I explore the common as a model for understanding how dance circulates through early twenty-first-century digital cultures and what happens when **technologically enabled decontextualization** allows dancers to bypass the social norms that sustain a movement culture.[@bench-2020-perpetual p.160]

> Employing the lens of the common allows me to approach the ways dancers corporeally and rhetorically configure dance within digital cultural practices. What can dance, movement, and gesture afford—and what conflicts arise—when they are perceived as common or utilized to enact a common? How, why, and for whom are assertions of dance as common meaningful in digital contexts?[p.9]

Perhaps what they were doing stopped there? Perhaps the smartphone was solely a low-friction way to record the dancing they were doing, or the game they were playing. Perhaps they were feverishly archiving their dancing. Perhaps.

But perhaps the biggest oversight is Bench is describing these digital commons as a mechanism for distribution and circulation. 

Perhaps they had started some game and the smartphone became an innocent part of that game, like a 'What if we did this?' moment.

## Device paradigm, focal things and dancing reserve

> If the essence of technē is poiesis, or bringing forth (Hervorbringen), then modern technology, a product of European modernity, no longer possesses the same essence as technē but is rather an "enframing" (Gestell) apparatus, in the sense that all beings become standing reserves (Bestand) for it.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag]

 [[Heidegger's standing reserve]]. See p.31 of [jacobs-2021-from]. They become standing reserve for TikTok. 

As social media subjects they are standing reserve; mere commodities for ... But as human beings, they are not.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]


Kołakowski's definition of technology doesn't seem so clearly related to Hui's. It seems to fit most simply into a broad understanding of the world as being able to be manipulated or perhaps automated; a world which renders technologically-driven processes invisible. At a stretch, this connects Kołakowski's thinking with Heidegger's notion of enframing (Gestell), a process of revealing and which "all beings become standing reserve"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]—a term I will return to later in this writing. 

> For example, we challenge land to yield coal, treating the land as nothing but a reserve. The coal is then stored, "on call, ready to deliver the sun's warmth that is stored in it," which is then "challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running." The factories are themselves challenged to produce tools "through which once again machines are set to work and maintained."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

- could rewrite this as: We challenge people to yield dance, treating these people as nothing but a reserve. The dance is then stored in the cloud,[^cloud] subjected to algorithms on call, ready to deliver the creativity and movement that is stored in their dance. This dancing turns the wheels that keep people online while serving them ads.


So frictionless, and clean. 4k pristine-ness. Way beyond industrial modernity in which the pleasure and play of these two young people is frictionless and clean labor of our time, in 4k. It's not even laboriousness. It is monetization of pleasure and joy without them being aware of it. These economics are hidden from the pleasure and joy of their dancing together in public. 

[^cloud]: There is no cloud: [skellis.net/blog/there-is-no-cloud](https://www.skellis.net/blog/there-is-no-cloud)


Standing reserve is a "resource waiting to be used".[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

> Now, as a human being he is not mere standing-reserve; but as a forester he is.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

as human beings they are not mere standing reserve. But as ... well, what are they? What else might I imagine them to be? Dancers? Filmmakers? Teenagers? How I identify them determines what kind of standing reserve they become. But perhaps end result is the same (thinking Zuboff here). The net effect is—based on Zuboff—the same. I see them as dancing reserve. They are a resource waiting to be used. Their screendancing is this resource. Their friendship is this resource. It's devastating. I want to see this differently. But I can't. 


> ... these acts [above re standing reserve] occur primarily by our own doing; we belong to the activity. Technological conscriptions of things occur in a sense prior to our actual technical use of [p.72] them, because things must be (and be seen as) already available resources in order for them to be used in this fashion. ... But these technical ends are never ends in themselves: "A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences." This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but instead, "only enters into its circuit," and is "regulating and securing" natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.[@blitz-2014-understanding pp.71-72]

This circularity is a key feature of standing reserve. How might I describe the circularity of these two women? Also am reminded of [[technological forces and recursion]].

see [[Feenberg - From Essentialism to Constructivism#^6a69ce]] for very clear summary of device paradigm and sense of the hiding.


Albert Borgmann is an American scholar working in the philosophy of technology. His book _Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life_ (1984) builds on Heidegger's concept of enframing (Gestell) and introduces two key terms: the _device paradigm_, and _focal things_.

the technology of software and hardware is enframed as a source of friendship expressed through dancing. The software in particular—and its mathematics—is hidden. 

The device paradigm is a way of understanding technology as a device or series of devices that deliver commodities, and that the mechanisms for this delivery are hidden. Technology becomes synonymous with devices and not the hidden mechanisms. Which direction is the delivery operating? 

A focal thing is intimately connected to practice and is something that delivers more than one commodity. For example, a hearth is for more than just warmth: it is communal, social, and even a place for cooking and sharing food. 

[[focal activity is a convex lens]]—they were sending it out into the world: the conditions of lockdown (outdoors), the tech, the nature of friendship.
[[borgmann, effort and focal things]]—incarnational, effort
[[device paradigm and focal things]]—but their behaviour definitely operating as a device paradigm
the technology faded into the background. The focal thing hid the device paradigm [[device paradigm and focal things#^fb451d]]

- or something about spirit (their spirit), that in those few minutes, overwhelmed the tech. Something became possible. Something was illuminated through technological affordances. the smartphone became a hearth: enframed, and [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]. (really?) Terrible terrible paradox of our time. Much like Blanco-Borelli discusses. magic trick. 

Jacobs describes the Polish philosopher's definition of technology as being broader than we usually understand it, as "instruments for manipulating our environment and ourselves."[Kołakowski, in @jacobs-2019-technopoly p.3]. Manipulation in this sense is not necessarily a _bad_ thing. For example, each time we use a fork we are manipulating the environment such that we can eat.  

(essentialist view of tech—see Feenberg who describes lack of clarity as to whether we are discussing attitude towards technology or the design of technologies): [[Feenberg - From Essentialism to Constructivism#^ef59e7]]

> Introducing the Bremen lectures, Heidegger observes that because of technology, "all distances in time and space are shrinking" and "yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance." The lectures set out to examine what this nearness is that remains absent and is "even warded off by the restless removal of distances." As we shall see, we have become almost incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone understanding it, because all things increasingly present themselves to us as technological: we see them and treat them as what Heidegger calls a "standing reserve," supplies in a storeroom, as it were, pieces of inventory to be ordered and conscripted, assembled and disassembled, set up and set aside. Everything approaches us merely as a source of energy or as something we must organize. We treat even human capabilities as though they were only means for technological procedures, as when a worker becomes nothing but an instrument for production. Leaders and planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human resources to be arranged, rearranged, and disposed of. Each and every thing that presents itself technologically thereby loses its distinctive independence and form. We push aside, obscure, or simply cannot see, other possibilities.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.68]

who is doing this treating? Am I treating these two women in this way by focusing on the standing reserve? No, it's really software. "loses its distinctive independence and form"—this is the terrible worry. 
I need to look for other possibilities. Is it presenting itself, or am I presenting it in this way? 

But I don't want to see it in this way. It's too easy, and requires so little effort from me as writer, and you as reader. This is the finite game we are all playing as digital technologies predicated on the attention economy play us. 

This technological filter I have already (and perhaps unjustly) put on these two young people dancing creates one problem that will help frame what is to follow. And that is before even a vague discussion about how technology is and can be defined.

I am already dancing around Martin Heidegger; it is a soft-shoe shuffle. Others have danced with him in this journal over the years ...

They were indeed playing, and it likely clear that the technology and particularly the software was also playing them.  infinite game ... but with a brutal and less than benign heartbeat?

I find Bench's position on the digital commons somewhat confusing/ambiguous. The common is her fundamental lens to understand the transmission and circulation of dance. She recognises how the "participatory commons appeals as an alternative to the extractive neoliberal financial logics that govern much of contemporary life."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.4] equivocation? or just recognising the paradox? But why no mention of this is not an alternative at all. Touches on this 

and I suspect they are only there due to pandemic lockdown restrictions. That is, without SARS-CoV-2 virus perhaps they would have danced in the privacy of their own home(s)? 

the burden of responsibility now rests squarely on the shoulders of the individual. The 

that is distinctive in two ways. The first is the recognition that the process of modernization is never-ending. There is no end-game, or point at which human affairs become "totally transparent thanks to knowing everything needing to be known."[@bauman-2000-liquid p.29] The second is that 

This is one of the tremendous paradoxes of our time: it undermines the binary of the focal thing vs device paradigm. or is it freedom v security (and safety) - Baumann?

Then what? Where does that leave those of us thinking about the body and movement for screen? Does it do anything to us? Does it help? Get in the way? 

> In a postmodern society overcome with new media, Charli D’Amelio can be deemed a martyr for new ICTs that encourage synoptic surveillance and the desire to be watched.[@richards-2021-tiktok n.pag.] 

I didn't see the mediated, algorithm-ed, commodification of their dancing on TikTok, even though it was revealed to a certain extent in their m. Yet I can also imagine their video ghosts on a small screen: the framing, the dancing, the music, the stickers, the desire to share and be seen. For the purposes of this writing can we agree that their dance was shaped algorithmically? Mention here Morrison et al and algorithms of performance? (from Blanco Borelli and moore)

Let us also agree that to talk about technology in any guise is to talk about economics. The social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff states in _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ (2019) that "technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action."[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1.V The Puppet Master, Not the Puppet: n.pag.] 

The social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff has a Neil Postman-like attitude towards technology. In _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ (2019) Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as the "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1] The purpose of these hidden extractive operations is to predict our future behaviours and to sell those predictions to advertisers. This mostly hidden economy functions because ata and advertising rule the world.[@noauthor-2017-world]

These two young people on the common during lockdown perform familiar movements of the head and neck—I've seen similar kinds of movement or dancing in films, and I can sense or remember them in my body. 

It's much more like an ice-berg. That something is being done to these two people beneath the surface of their awareness. The screen is above the water—we can see its beauty, the way it reflects the sun. But below the surface, the algorithms are extending up into how they move and for how long. 

Low friction technology (convenience, see [[how informs what and this produces culture#^aa0fb6]]) and our behavior, ways of thinking and epistemic understanding change. This is Postman really. This is the printing press. Bench is talking about documentation (is this accurate?). I'm talking about making. Yes, how things are made is changing. That's a given. But what things are made. It goes all the way back to the kinds of dancing. Our focus has been on how technologies influence production, post-production, and presentation. Opportunity here to mention key influences of screendance writing about editing, production (many from IJSD?, Pearlman) But the mode of presentation (this is where we dance now) is inevitably reaching backwards through the film-making 'workflow' into the dancing itself. These are dances enframed by software (more than hardware) and algorithms. But they are also dances of togetherness, pleasure. The hearth? 

- I wonder what the tool is in this example of mine. But certainly it is 'forcing' particular things. Affording others. But it's so early to tell (see Postman and mechanical clock). What is it that we do know or that we can see already happening?

For most of the time preparing and writing this article, I found it difficult to sublimate my sense of dread in what I saw that day. Such a position is simply too easy to adopt. Can we agree that their screendance—and it is so clearly a dance for screens—appeared as it did and was performed as it was because of the smartphone they were holding, and its software that will fucntion to swallow them and their dance when they are finished? 

Let me paint that bleakest of bleak pictures. I want to get it out of the way. Not dwell on it. To acknowledge its presence, and the ease with which it can be painted. To give it substance such that we can get to the critical questions of this writing. To recognise that the real struggle for screendance practitioners is not between no-tech analogue dancing and the algorithms of social media platforms, but "within the realm of possibilities"[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.301] opened up by this exchange, this social dance, this elemental friendship I witnessed.

"dance in public is greatly facilitated by the channels of distribution that social media offer, and its meaning is accentuated by other similar circulations"[@bench-2020-perpetual p.65]

This is distinct from ... the kind of dancing in public Bench describes: [[Bench - Perpetual Motion#^266756]]

I trust though that my assumption does not prevent these ideas from having some value to how we might understand social and artistic contexts in screendance. 

I would like to make sense of what I saw that day. In this writing I try to make sense of what I saw that day through _awe_ (note link to Kaufman's Transcend here). I want to recognise and describe the patterns of their trio (two people and a smartphone), and how these patterns Before I do this I need to paint a bleak picture.

This article is about screendance and ... (then say who I think it's for).

Be precise about the technology. It's not so much the smartphone, but the software. And what is this software an instance of? It's not all technology. Not all software.

Postman died in 2003: a year before Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, three years before Dorsey, Glass, Stone and Williams founded Twitter, four years before the release of the first iPhone, and six years before Facebook added its _like_ button.

In the case of Roth (artist), it would be as if the software's role was to capture the slides and touches of the gesture in his work and then upload them to (most likely) massive Amazon Web Services servers. This is a very very different thing. Much more subtle. Much less direct. But not at all subtle, and utterly direct. Because of course I have no doubt that our screen-based gestures are being uploaded.

> For these thinkers modernity continues to be characterized by a unique form of technical action and thought that threatens nontechnical values as it extends itself ever deeper into social life. They argue that technology is not neutral.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism pp.294-295] 

In _Between Faces_,[-@ellis-2018-faces] dance artist Simon Ellis describes how we in screendance ought to take the hyper-presence of smartphones very seriously. He describes how smartphone cameras and screens create a dizzyingly reflexive situation in which we have: "a moving body on screen, a moving body having operated the camera (which is often simply a smartphone screen), and a moving body holding a screen/smart-phone as the video is played back and watched."[@ellis-2018-faces n.pag]

But Ellis leaves out something crucial. He leaves out the part that screendance scholar Erin Brannigan calls pro-filmic events. These "occur in real time at the moment of filming"[@brannigan-2009-microchoreographies p.121] and are distinct from filmic elements inherent to the final screen version. 

But what if anything is pro-filmic about these two people I saw dancing for their smartphone that afternoon?  In theory, yes. But in practice, no. In practice I think they are more deeply involved in simply being friends. The 'filmic' aspect of their behaviour is not something I am privy to, and it is an open question as to how present it is for them. 

It's am ambivalent and paradoxical process. 

- what if include Gutenberg section here but deals with modes of production. The cat is out of the bag. Any gatekeepers of what is and isn't screendance (if there ever were any—the editors of this journal? the curators of screendance festivals?), or what should or shouldn't be are too late. 


>As I argued in my book Life Inc., the Great Exhibition’s primary intent was to distract the domestic public from the dark underbelly of international industrial modernity. Through this spectacle, Queen Victoria and the corporations she sponsored disconnected these technologies from the human toll they inflicted on their operators. As if in a shopping mall, people gawked, their jaws dropping, at the steam pipes and gears, utterly unaware of the faces and hands the machines burned and mauled. People saw products and production, but never the producers themselves. If anything, industrial modernity was simpler and cleaner than manual labor. As much a welcome step back as a daring leap forward.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding The Short Forever: Act Now, n.pag.]


I didn't want to spend too long gawking, and yet I also sense how their dancing and indeed joy distracted me from the profound choreography of the situation. This is choreography of the kind in which the screen-phone ... Unaware they are burned and mauled (unknown to them). 

Start with Heidegger. inevitable it has been written about so much in dance, and the ways in which technologies have influenced corporeal practices. In the second (?) volume of this journal, Cooper Albright asked four (?) artists to respond to Heidegger.  IJSD—mention ACA's collection. 

Thinking about Pippa and dancing with her friends. The dancing is a conduit in much the same way the screendancing is a conduit. A way to build, sustain and be in friendship. The screendance is not the point, it is more a by-product of being together.

- could be something about infinite game; tech and production of screendance (regardless of output) is finite, their play is infinite.

This is all a very roundabout way of saying that this article is about screendance and technology, and in it I discuss what is made possible when we work or play with smartphone hardware and software as we dance, and what is lost or compromised. 

### James Bridle and Evan Roth

Bridle discusses a form of architecture called [[parametricism]] in which complex analogue forms are developed from digital tools. He memorably describes such architecture as "eruptions of the digital into the physical world"[@bridle-2011-new n.pag.]. But there's something different going on here. There's no eruption. It's much more like an ice-berg. That something is being done to these two people beneath the surface of their awareness. The screen is above the water—we can see its beauty, the way it reflects the sun. But below the surface, the digital is reaching up and enframing how they move and for how long. 


Evan Roth's multi-touch finger paintings are useful here. They depict our gestures with phones, with names like _Slide to Unlock_, _User Name and Password_ and _Angry Birds, Level I-1_.[@roth-2012-multitouch] They are simple, and beautiful, and smudgy, not unlike smartphone screens themselves. Reflections tainted by the greasy smudges of our fingers. James Bridle describes Roth's images as "gestures mediated by the machine"[@bridle-2011-new n.pag.] They are images unimaginable before 2007 when the iPhone was launched upon us, yet they are also familiar because of our relationship to thumbprints, and to fingerprint technologies. I am reminded of my pre-teen years and my fascination with how finger prints were (and are) a method to deduce who did what. Roth's paintings are made possible by the machine, and the machine (and more accurately the software) has shaped these gestures. But Roth's awareness is critical. How he draws attention to the gestures as manipulated/mediated by the software-hardware interface. 

>But most people use social media not to unite, not to open their horizons wider, but on the contrary, to cut themselves a comfort zone where the only sounds they hear are the echoes of their own voice, where the only things they see are the reflections of their own face. Social media are very useful, they provide pleasure, but they are a trap.[Zygmunt Bauman, in @dequerol-2016-zygmunt n.pag.]



- friendship, play and the infinite game

I am not interested in discussing teenage use of social media. 

This writing also contains a trap of my own making. It is a trap akin to . 

> Of course, were there no way out of technological thinking, Heidegger's own standpoint, however sophisticated, would also be trapped within it. He attempts to show a way out - a way to think about technology that is not itself beholden to technology.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.69] 

^29940f

- this is really what I'm doing in this essay—I'm tripping into a way to think about technology that is beholden to it. Right? 

>There is a whole economic system here of which the forester has willy-nilly become a part. Trees make timber, which makes cellulose, which makes paper, which makes newspapers—and because the process is repeated and ongoing, all that material has to be held in "standing-reserve," that is, 

 He likens a swarm to incessant copying of images that no longer have an original, and that each unit of the swarm 

> In a liquid-modern society, swarms tend to replace groups, with their leaders, hierarchies, and pecking orders. A swarm can do without all those paraphernalia without which a group could not exist. Swarms need not be burdened by the group’s tools of survival: they assemble, disperse, and come together again from one occasion to another, each time guided by different, invariably shifting relevancies, and attracted by changing and moving targets.[@bauman-2008-does p.15]

> A swarm can be visualized best as being like Warhol’s endlessly copied images without an original, or with an original that was discarded and impossible to trace and retrieve. Each unit of the swarm reenacts the moves made by the others, while performing the whole job, from beginning to end and in all its parts, alone (in the case of consuming swarms, that job is the job of consuming).[@bauman-2008-does p.16] 

> Every technology is both a burden and a blessing; not either-or, but this-and-that.[@postman-1993-technopoly pp.4-5]

### Technological determinism

Technological determinism is the idea that technological development determines social change or human behaviour. These represent old and rather obvious stories of technology. , , so old that it is a trope one that is little more than a trope or meme. In the _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (1962) Marshall McLuhan wrote ... Heidegger; Determinism.

This is the history of technologies –- affording certain behaviours, preventing others . 

Affordances . Gibson. Technologies afford behaviours 
- two perspectives; one is what is afforded by the interaction and indeed the technology. Technologies afford behaviours. 

The _problem_ is seen everywhere. In dance, technological determinism can be seen as a problem or a possibility. Cooper Albright has written of "how the ubiquity of screens in contemporary dance affects how we watch movement"[@cooperalbright-2012-tensions p.21], and Ellis has described how the hyper-presence of movement on screens has increased screendance literacy[@ellis-2018-faces] 

Again, this is a cliche. We are changed. But how is the question, and do we want this? Or perhaps it's the invisible things (as Postman says) that are the key? 


Zuboff also writes of how "the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people"[-@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] and bypassed the priesthood of that age. She describes the internet as a democratizing power that mirror's Gutenberg's revolution exponentially. The cost however is the hidden processes of data extraction "designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure", that have created a new priesthood of privately owned companies in Silicon Valley. We have been returned to the "pre-Gutenberg order"[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] by this technocratic priesthood which seeks competitive advantage through surveillance, fully weaponised by the printing press of our time. We have been both freed and enslaved.

### Gutenberg and the printing press

In 2015 the dance scholar Harmony Bench wrote an influential article called _Digital Research in Dance Studies: Emerging Trends in a Still-Emerging Field_. Bench wrote of the movement of dance practices, the endless scenarios in which dance occurs, and how video documentation is changing dance: 

>The impact of this unleashing of documentation could not be more profound. [...] Let me be clear: for those of us who produce or conduct research in the areas of dance, movement, and gesture, this is our "Gutenberg."[@bench-2015-digital n.pag.]

To compare unparalleled access to video documentation of dance with the printing press is seductive. But which kind of "Gutenberg" moment is Bench referring to? Ubiquity? Democratization? There is also potential darkness in Bench's comparison. 

sine qua non

add Postman here? Also McLuhan's Gutenberg Galaxy.



> Central to his ideas about culture was his concept of media as "extensions of man." Following this line of thought, he argued that Gutenberg's printing press not only played a role in spreading information, but also in shaping human thought. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2015/09/27/these-4-visionaries-saw-far-into-the-future-heres-how-they-did-it/>

> The point is that the same technology can answer questions differently, depending on the context into which it is introduced and the problem it is designed to solve.[@kranzberg-1986-technology p.546]


>each generation stumbles into the quicksand of forgetting that technology is an expression of other interests. In modern times this means the interests of capital, and in our time it is surveillance capital that commands the digital milieu and directs our trajectory toward the future.[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1.V. The Puppet Master, Not the Puppet: n.pag.] 

I also understand this writing to be an expression of rationality in the sense that I hope it reveals my interests, understanding, and concerns and how these "shape what is likely, what is pertinent, what is useful, and what matters".[@noe-2015-strange Part I, Chapter 5: Art, Evolution, and the Puzzle of Puzzles, n.pag.] 

> All we presentists get from zooming out to ten-thousand-year time spans is vertigo.[@rushkoff-2013-present]

>we live in a world with multiple timescales, all moving simultaneously but at different speeds. Brand calls it the order of civilization. Nature, or geological time, moves the slowest—like the skater in the middle of the pinwheel. This is the rate at which glaciers carve out canyons or species evolve gills and wings—over eons. On the next level is culture, such as that of the Chinese or the Jews—which lasts millennia. On the next concentric ring comes governance—the rather long-lasting systems of monarchies and republics. The next level is infrastructure—the roads and utilities those governments build and rebuild. Faster yet is commerce that occurs through that infrastructure. And finally the outermost ring is that of fashion—the ever-changing styles and whims that keep the wheels of commerce fed.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

>We could still operate on the timescale of the seasonally changing fashions or TV schedules while remaining cognizant of the greater cycles binding humanity to the cosmos.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

Note also that Rushkoff questions Brand's thinking/practice later in same chapter:

> In other words, what’s it like to envision the ten-thousand-year impact of tossing that plastic bottle into the trash bin, all in the single second it takes to actually toss it? Or the ten-thousand-year history of the fossil fuel being burned to drive to work or iron a shirt? It may be environmentally progressive, but it’s not altogether pleasant. Unless we’re living in utter harmony with nature, thinking in ten-thousand-year spans is an invitation to a nightmarish obsession. It’s a potentially burdensome, even paralyzing, state of mind. Each present action becomes a black hole of possibilities and unintended consequences. We must walk through life as if we had traveled into the past, aware that any change we make—even moving an ashtray two inches to the left—could ripple through time and alter the course of history. It’s less of a Long Now than a Short Forever.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding n.pag] 

Ambivalence and wonder

I've placed xx things on the table: technological determinism, enframing, focal activity, the printing press, and friendship. They seem a long way from these two young people taking pleasure in dancing and videoing their dancing.

See Rushkoff below.

>It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]


My assumed knowledge of what their _play_ was for changes how I see what I see. 

My work here is to understand this technology in a very specific social and artistic context. It is a context for which these hardware and software technologies were not necessarily designed, but nor were they not designed for it. Extrapolation—the context in which I saw it. First extrapolation: what happened next? Second extrapolation: relevance to screendance. Or perhaps an assumption and an extrapolation. Assumption of what happened next. Extrapoloation into screendance.

**Edit this paragraph (which connects to the one above with Noe quote) to be about what matters and what is useful to screendance.** The technology of the time afforded particular behaviours that included dancing. There was nothing particularly new in the dancing, nor in the recording devices, and certainly nothing particularly new in the social networking software it easy to imagine they will have used after the recording was complete. It certainly is not two friends playing. Is there anything new in what I saw that has some value to the artistic and academic screendance community? Add brief mention here of technological determinism (maybe). This technological dynamic is barely regulated. Zuboff's beef really.

My assumed knowledge of what this "play" is for changes how I see what I see. See [[Rushkoff – Present Shock#^9ab84a]]:

> When we focus on the space around the pieces, we have shifted to the time sensibility of kairos. The space between things matters more than the things themselves. We are thinking less about tinkering with particular objects than about recognizing or influencing the patterns they create and the connections they make.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 4: Fractalnoia—To Be Or Not To Be, n.pag]

Human beings have a bias towards positive outcomes. This is well documented by what is known as the framing effect[@tversky-1981-framing] in which the same  


And now it's 1976 and I have to be quiet because my sister is recording a TV screening of ABBA through her portable cassette recorder's on-board microphone. Ssshhhh! Later she plays back this lowest of lo-fi recordings and grooves to _Dancing Queen_.[@abba-1976-dancing] My sister at the time is 14 years old, and that shoebox-sized hunk of _modern_ at the time recording technology enforces my silence, if only for 3 minutes and 52 seconds. 

In the ABBA example the technology did not reach out and through the recording device/tech and shape my sister's dancing. The music did. The technology was not absent, nor neutral. ?? It was a technique to enable my sister to listen to the song. 

Is there anything _new_ in what I observed that afternoon? Was their behaviour so different from my sister recording and then dancing to ABBA? 

[[the framing effect]] - how I present what I saw matters 

Two versions of the same thing! Possible?


This text is a series of projections and confabulations disguised as an attempt to understand and communicate my ambivalence and wonder regarding what I saw that afternoon in a park on the outskirts of London during lockdown. But before I get to ambivalence and wonder, I need to take three steps backwards.

What is the "new" behaviour here? Anything to do with screendance? It's not new behaviour as such, and yet it's entirely new. Both new and old. Is there anything new in what I saw? It isn't the dancing; it isn't recording devices; it likely isn't even the social networking software I imagine they'll use to share their dancing afterwards. It certainly isn't two friends playing. 

>The particular tone of the sage’s skepticism is ironic, and the sage is in some essential sense an ironist, but his irony is always directed primarily toward himself. Indeed, this is precisely why people should seek him out to govern them: His primary qualification for office is the gently humorous attitude he takes toward himself, which then extends outward toward our technological "enframing" of the world. [@jacobs-2021-tech p.40]

- thinking here of the tone of my voice in this writing. What would it be like to smile at the tech and ignore it in this case? To write a section dealing with the mess of nature/stewardly care, but then to ask the reader to ignore it. That that section is a version of myself that is more troubling, less important. Worth ignoring, or perhaps, at best, just smiling at. Can I mock the tech? 

Zuboff uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process. On one side are the technologies of surveillance capitalism that are designed to "render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.1] On the other side is the fact that "every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to 'datafication'".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.1] We _render_ "unto surveillance capitalism" a continuous supply of raw materials. 

Most importantly for this writing, the rendition of our bodies begins quite simply with our phones.[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.2] 

>the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people, rescuing the prayers, bypassing the priesthood, and delivering the opportunity for spiritual communion directly into the hands of the prayerful. We have come to take for granted that the internet enables an unparalleled diffusion of information, promising more knowledge for more people: a mighty democratizing force that exponentially realizes Gutenberg’s revolution in the lives of billions of individuals. But this grand achievement has blinded us to a different historical development, one that moves out of range and out of sight, designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure. In this hidden movement the competitive struggle over surveillance revenues reverts to the pre-Gutenberg order as the division of learning in society shades toward the pathological, captured by a narrow priesthood of privately employed computational specialists, their privately owned machines, and the economic interests for whose sake they learn.[@zuboff-2019-age n.pag.]


"surveillance capitalism" revenues a development that ... the products of which are about prediction. Prediction of us, our future behaviour, our futures.  

the "unprecedented" world of surveillance capitalism. We don't yet know what to do. It has not been seen before. 

In 2017 _The Economist_ declared that the "world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data".[@noauthor-2017-world] This age of _surveillance capitalism_ is founded on "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1] 

It is a specific action, and is playfully performed. 

This is a story about ambivalence, perhaps even moral ambivalence. 

[[pro-filmic events occur in real time at the moment of filming]]—but they are more than this. They are being. friends. It's am ambivalent and paradoxical process. The 'filmic' is certainly irrelevant from my perspective, but I imagine from theirs (but not entirely). 
 
and it is also clear that in this writing I've already projected an enormous amount onto what they were doing. 


that what follows is provoked by what I saw that afternoon during 2 or 3 brief minutes.
