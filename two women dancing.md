# Lithium dancing (hidden in plain sight)
## possible ideas to consider or keep in mind
(in plain sight | Dancing reserve | Ambivalence and wonder in three minutes of dancing | The case of two people dancing | Hidden in plain sight)

> When two people dance, their movements and actions and thoughts and perceptions are entrained by the larger organization, the dancing itself.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 2 Reorganizing Ourselves, n.p.]

Can I discuss paradox of the situation in terms of device paradigm and focal things? But what does this all matter for screendance? These are questions of culture: of privacy and freedom. We must make visible. To unhide. To recognise the games that are being played (on us).

- perhaps I am talking about two types of hiding. One is device paradigm/algorithmic. The other is how to respond (based on Jacobs' thinking)??
- theme of hidden. See also Jacobs and hidden: [[Jacobs - After Technopoly#^518461]]. 
- think through [[moral and ethical implications of our tools]] as overview of my thinking in this writing -- as a way of narrowing its focus

## Abstract


---

 >the outside world, the non-digital world, is merely a theatrical space in which one stages and records content for the much more real, much more vital digital space.[@burnham-2021-inside n.pag]

> Here indeed, the whole mechanism of the operation is invisible to the viewer: the deepest darkness reigns: suddenly, a ghost appears, far, far away at first, appearing as a point of light to the audience. But it soon grows, becomes bigger and bigger and seems to approach slowly at first, to then rush towards the spectators: the illusion is total.[Victor de Moléon (1836), in @chateau-2016-screensa pp.49-50]
 
## Two young people and their camera

_In which I describe an actual event that prompted this thinking-writing._

I am out for a walk during my one hour of permitted outdoor exercise. It is March 2021 and we are nearing the end of the strictest part of the UK's second national lockdown. 

They are two young people, perhaps 15 years old, playing together in a park, or what is called a common. The area is not nature as such but it is also definitely not the city. 

I am walking past them, wary of watching or intruding, but also captivated by their play. They are dancing for each other. Or rather, one of them is dancing for the other who is recording the dancing on a smartphone held in portrait mode. The camera and the dancer are close to each other; it's a close-up. They take turns: they dance, record, watch, point at the screen, and laugh.

The dancing is mostly movement in the head and neck; rolling the head side to side around the frontal axis. They more or less do the same short sequence every time, as if they are trying to perfect the performance of the moves, or the recording of the performances. This trio of two young people and a smartphone are deep in their own world. Their game seems to be on repeat. The movement has a quality of being able to be reversed, repeated, or played back. Each dance is exquisitely brief, and not linear or forward seeking. It is as if there is a visual glitch in their matrix.

By this stage I'm some way past where it is they are dancing. It has been no more than three minutes since I first saw them. 

## An assumption about what happened next

_In which I introduce the central conceit (or assumption) of this article, the structure, and how any discussion of technology is a discussion about economics._

In Volume 11 of IJSD -- _Expanded Screendance_ -- Katrina McPherson noted Douglas Rosenberg's description of screendance as "the most invasive of all arts species" that "has been hiding in plain site since well before there was a critical mass of interest in the form, even before it was named as such."[Rosenberg, in @mcpherson-2020-walking p.55] Then, Volume 12 of IJSD -- _This is where we dance now: COVID-19 and the new and next in dance onscreen_ -- acknowledged and even celebrated screendance's undeniable visibility as people danced and watched dancing through screens during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. In that same issue, Elena Benthaus described feeling "wary"[@benthaus-2021-this p.283] that screendance was somehow hidden before COVID-19 acted as a great revealer, and outlined how dance fads have long been "circulated by Hollywood musicals and dance films" and TV shows.[@benthaus-2021-this p.283; see also @bench-2020-perpetual p.10]

These descriptions of the practices of screendance being variously hidden, revealed, circulated, and invasive is telling in how those of us interested in screendance -- as artists and/or scholars -- narrate or construct its history and practices. Something will always be hiding (in plain sight) if there isn't yet a name for it, or the desire to do that naming. When we name anything we render it visible. 

This writing is not about the kind of hiding that speaks to what I imagine is screendance's uncertainty about itself and desire for recognition. Instead, it is an attempt to understand what I couldn't see when I happened across those two young people making dances for their smartphone, and how mechanisms and narratives of _hiding_ might matter to those of us who create screendances. 

These two young people were dancing in plain sight while recording their movement, but it's not possible to know with any certainty _why_ they were recording their dancing. Perhaps what they were doing stopped there? Perhaps they had started some game and the smartphone became an innocent part of that game, like a 'What if we did this?' moment. Perhaps the smartphone was solely a low-friction way to record the dancing they were doing, or the game they were playing. Perhaps they were feverishly archiving their dancing. Perhaps. 

The assumption on which this writing rests is that what I saw that day was not the the full story; that what they did next or soon after was to post the _best version_ of their screendance performances _on social_. I think this is a fair assumption because, as Harmony Bench suggests, it is "difficult if not impossible to separate dance in public from social media in an era when the latter are determining forces of contemporary social life and engagement."[-@bench-2020-perpetual p.65] I am agnostic towards social media platforms, but given how much dancing is happening on TikTok[See for example @blancoborelli-2021-tiktok; @harlig-2021-tiktok] I will assume that this was their social media of choice.

My assumption effectively renders these two young people as representations or proxies; they stand in for all humans recording their dancing and uploading it to social media, not solely teenagers doing the same thing. People dance, record their dancing, and upload those recordings to social media; and we do all of these things routinely. Volume 12 of IJSD is testimony to the fact that these cultural levers and patterns of social media technologies are deeply embedded in screendance practices.[See again for instance @blancoborelli-2021-tiktok; and also @benthaus-2021-this] 

It's worth bearing in mind, even at this early stage of this article, that all technologies -- including those of social media -- are developments "largely oriented economically to profit-making"[@weber-1978-economy Part 1, p.67] and that "technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action."[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1.V The Puppet Master, Not the Puppet: n.pag.] 

- add bit about my assumptions not unwarranted, and also 'digital commons'

## Algorithmic choreography

_In which I ... _

> embedded in every tool is an ideological bias, a predisposition to construct the world as one thing rather than another, to value one thing over another, to amplify one sense or skill or attitude more loudly than another.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.13]

In _TikTok and Short-Form Screendance Before and After Covid_ the internet anthropologist Crystal Abidin describes how TikTok shapes you "to create content in specific ways", and is "squishing you into a template and teaching you how to perform creativity within a box."[in @harlig-2021-tiktok p.192] If these two people on the common during lockdown -- or anyone for that matter -- set out to make algorithmically inspired screendance it would likely look like the dancing they were doing, and be shot with the smartphone they were using. I suspect though that they did not set out to make a screendance the way IJSD readers might understand an _intention_ to make a screendance. Rather, the screendance they made was made _on_ them, but without them being aware of -- nor probably caring about -- the coercion or denial of agency.

Who is doing the choreography here? These are ways of moving shaped by the great unseen of our time. This is a machine that doesn't see these young dancer-choreographers, it doesn't need to. It is not a machine of the state, a panopticon, but rather a commercial machine. These young dancing people are being directed by a machine that has no need for eyes. But it's not so simple is it? 

This machine was programmed. The algorithms -- opinions "formalized in code"[@oneil-2016-weapons Chapter 3: Arms Race, n.pag] --  were created by _someone_, perhaps more than one person: a cloud of choreographers-as-developers; unseen, hidden. It's difficult to imagine that those software developers were even aware of how these two women might end up dancing as a consequence of the code they created in Kotlin, Java, Swift or Objective C. At the same time, I would rather not overestimate the sophistication of their mathematics; it is more a question of how few data points are required for us to reveal ourselves. The Wall Street Journal recently found that although shares, likes, follows and the things you watch play a role in determining one's FYP (For You Page) on TikTok, the platform needs only one piece of data to "figure you out": "how long you linger over a piece of content."[@wallstreetjournal-2021-how n.pag.]

I didn't see the mediated, algorithm-ed, commodification of their dancing on TikTok, even though it was revealed to a certain extent in their movement-performances-on-repeat. Yet I can also imagine their filmic ghosts on a small screen: the framing, the dancing, the music, the stickers, the desire to share and be seen. For the purposes of this writing can we agree that their dance was shaped algorithmically? Mention here Morrison et al and algorithms of performance? (from Blanco Borelli and moore)

This is one of the tremendous paradoxes of our time: it undermines the binary of the focal thing vs device paradigm. or is it freedom v security (and safety) - Baumann?

Then what? Where does that leave those of us thinking about the body and movement for screen? Does it do anything to us? Does it help? Get in the way?  

## Being in (the) common
- [[swarms in liquid modernity]]

In 2000, the Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman described a liquid-modern society that is distinctive in two ways. The first is the recognition that the process of modernization is never-ending. There is no end-game, or point at which human affairs become "totally transparent thanks to knowing everything needing to be known."[@bauman-2000-liquid p.29] The second is that the burden of responsibility now rests squarely on the shoulders of the individual. The balance has tilted far from the societal improvement for the common good "towards the self-assertion of the individual."[@bauman-2000-liquid p.29] Bauman describes how, in liquid modernity, the public sphere has also become one of the "many spoils of deregulation, privatization, individualization, of the conquest and annexation of the public by the private."[@bauman-2008-does p.28]

These two young people are in a public space, and perhaps they are only there due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. That is, without COVID-19 perhaps they would have danced in the privacy of their own home(s)? This public space in the UK is called a common. Such spaces are owned privately, or by local councils or the National Trust. They have simple and reasonably relaxed rules, and are protected, cared for, and open. They are one of few areas in the UK not overwhelmed by CCTV. Yet within this public space, the public dances performed by these two people have been annexed by privately owned algorithms. This public-private paradox of the commons is a direct part of what social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff calls surveillance capitalism, that uses "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1] The purpose of these hidden extractive operations is to predict our future behaviors and to sell those predictions to advertisers. This mostly hidden economy functions because data and advertising rule the world's economy.[@noauthor-2017-world] 

In _Perpetual Motion: Dance, Digital Cultures, and the Common_ (2020) Harmony Bench describes and analyzes ... She suggests that what makes dances public "is as much about exposure to onsite spectators (who may not actually be the target audience) as it is about dancing in venues that are available and accessible to the general public."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.64]

> Dance in public avails itself of the digital commons, which both circulates and provides audiences for these videos. As a result, many of the public performances seem to target an audience of internet users more so than copresent spectators.[@bench-2020-perpetual p.65]

- [[Bench - Perpetual Motion#^3fb97b]] - but what is common about it? Is commonality about access? 
- tragedy of digital commons: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#Tragedy_of_the_digital_commons>
- what of externalities?  
-- contrast with Harmony's thinking on digital commons (which seems to have its own tragedy -- as I lay it out in the first part of this document)..
- should I talk about virality (that there's hope there). [[Blitz - Understanding Heidegger on Technology#^05e7db]]. It's still producing a virus (it just might not be a successful virus)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Commons_(Elsevier)> (plenty of issues with them: <https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/elsevier-academic-publishing-petition/427059/>)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_%28economics%29>

Their freedom to play and make was curtailed. They have been coerced under the illusion of freedom and play.  These two young people were certainly not  creating some content for our innocent digital commons.



- thinking about virality, and the viral load of their dance. That is, what is carried or infected. Vast host. Leviathon. we are the virus. we are the infectious agent. by watching we are how the true pathological agent thrives. cross-talk between host and virus. 
- habitat: social networks
- mode of transmission: Vector transmission -- we are the vectors. But this virus collects information as it passes from one host to another. We are not infected. 
- host: mobile phone? 
- immune system? 
- Imagine an ecosystem in which millions of viruses (and/or mutations of previous viruses) are produced every day. It is humans that produce these viruses. The system for transmission is a 'vector transmission'. Instead of mosquitoes carrying malaria, it is also humans who transmit these new viruses. We produce and transmit viruses. We are not harmed by the virus (at least on the surface). Each virus is hosted on a mobile phone that is connected to a vast global network and humans transmit that virus around that network. The habitat is social networks. Perfect conditions, perfectly resistant to any form of outside interference or compromises. Addictive. Potential Weakness is reliance on vector transmissions of viruses (by humans). That is, if humans stopped passing the virus onto others the habitat would disappear. The habitat is dependent on the presence of viruses. It would not exist without them. That's curious. The virus is less dependent on the social network habitat than the other way around. Without the network the virus still has a host (mobile) and can still be transmitted (through human sharing), but just not to scale. It's still a virus, but less likely to go viral! But all of this, ALL of this is made possible by massive massive organisms that more or less control the entire ecosystem. These are the leviathans of our time: mostly unregulated. The system of control is algorithmic. What's more, these organisms have an open secret -- each time a human views a virus or transmits (shares) a virus, these organisms extract information from the transmitters (we humans) that does two things: a) increases the desire of humans to produce and transmit more viruses; b) nourishes the organism by providing data that they can sell (to other humans who also produce viruses).  
- Can jump across different kinds of hosts (OS platforms) 


- logic of consumption (see <https://notesread.com/liquid-modernity/> disguised as a mode of production. The danger in valorizing their making -- their creativity. Social media leviathan.
- between productive and (failed) distributive economies.  (Sandel)

> And it is in our role as producers, not consumers, that we contribute to the common good and win recognition for doing so.[@sandel-2020-tyranny Chapter 7 Recognizing Work, n.pag.]

> According to the civic ideal, the common good is not simply about adding up preferences or maximizing consumer welfare. It is about reflecting critically on our preferences—ideally, elevating and improving them—so that we can live worthwhile and flourishing lives. This cannot be achieved through economic activity alone. It requires deliberating with our fellow citizens about how to bring about a just and good society, one that cultivates civic virtue and enables us to reason together about the purposes worthy of our political community.[@sandel-2020-tyranny Chapter 7 Recognizing Work, n.pag.]

## Device paradigm, focal things and dancing reserve

> If the essence of technē is poiesis, or bringing forth (Hervorbringen), then modern technology, a product of European modernity, no longer possesses the same essence as technē but is rather an "enframing" (Gestell) apparatus, in the sense that all beings become standing reserves (Bestand) for it.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag]

When we dance with technologies, we dance with profit-making. And perhaps we are only ever dancing with technologies? See all my notes here from Dance after Lockdown prep, reading and writing (on creative industries, McRobbie, Ladkin, eco-system, etc). Contrasts with Lepecki in Singularities.

This technological filter I have already (and perhaps unjustly) put on these two young people dancing creates one problem that will help frame what is to follow. And that is before even a vague discussion about how technology is and can be defined.

I am already dancing around Martin Heidegger; it is a soft-shoe shuffle. Others have danced with him in this journal over the years ...

They were indeed playing, and it likely clear that the technology and particularly the software was also playing them.  infinite game ... but with a brutal and less than benign heartbeat? [[Heidegger's standing reserve]]. See p.31 of [jacobs-2021-from]. They become standing reserve for TikTok. But I don't want to see it in this way. It's too easy, and requires so little effort from me as writer, and you as reader. This is the finite game we are all playing as digital technologies predicated on the attention economy play us. 

As social media subjects they are standing reserve; mere commodities for ... But as human beings, they are not.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

> Introducing the Bremen lectures, Heidegger observes that because of technology, "all distances in time and space are shrinking" and "yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance." The lectures set out to examine what this nearness is that remains absent and is "even warded off by the restless removal of distances." As we shall see, we have become almost incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone understanding it, because all things increasingly present themselves to us as technological: we see them and treat them as what Heidegger calls a "standing reserve," supplies in a storeroom, as it were, pieces of inventory to be ordered and conscripted, assembled and disassembled, set up and set aside. Everything approaches us merely as a source of energy or as something we must organize. We treat even human capabilities as though they were only means for technological procedures, as when a worker becomes nothing but an instrument for production. Leaders and planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human resources to be arranged, rearranged, and disposed of. Each and every thing that presents itself technologically thereby loses its distinctive independence and form. We push aside, obscure, or simply cannot see, other possibilities.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.68]

who is doing this treating? Am I treating these two women in this way by focusing on the standing reserve? No, it's really software. "loses its distinctive independence and form" -- this is the terrible worry. 
I need to look for other possibilities. Is it presenting itself, or am I presenting it in this way? 


Jacobs describes the Polish philosopher's definition of technology as being broader than we usually understand it, as "instruments for manipulating our environment and ourselves."[Kołakowski, in @jacobs-2019-technopoly p.3]. Manipulation in this sense is not necessarily a _bad_ thing. For example, each time we use a fork we are manipulating the environment such that we can eat.  

(essentialist view of tech -- see Feenberg who describes lack of clarity as to whether we are discussing attitude towards technology or the design of technologies): [[Feenberg - From Essentialism to Constructivism#^ef59e7]]

Kołakowski's definition of technology doesn't seem so clearly related to Hui's. It seems to fit most simply into a broad understanding of the world as being able to be manipulated or perhaps automated; a world which renders technologically-driven processes invisible. At a stretch, this connects Kołakowski's thinking with Heidegger's notion of enframing (Gestell), a process of revealing and which "all beings become standing reserve"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.] -- a term I will return to later in this writing. 

> For example, we challenge land to yield coal, treating the land as nothing but a reserve. The coal is then stored, "on call, ready to deliver the sun's warmth that is stored in it," which is then "challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running." The factories are themselves challenged to produce tools "through which once again machines are set to work and maintained."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

- could rewrite this as: We challenge people to yield dance, treating these people as nothing but a reserve. The dance is then stored in the cloud,[^cloud] subjected to algorithms on call, ready to deliver the creativity and movement that is stored in their dance. This dancing turns the wheels that keep people online while serving them ads.


So frictionless, and clean. 4k pristine-ness. Way beyond industrial modernity in which the pleasure and play of these two young people is frictionless and clean labor of our time, in 4k. It's not even laboriousness. It is monetization of pleasure and joy without them being aware of it. These economics are hidden from the pleasure and joy of their dancing together in public. 

[^cloud]: There is no cloud: [skellis.net/blog/there-is-no-cloud](https://www.skellis.net/blog/there-is-no-cloud)


Standing reserve is a "resource waiting to be used".[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

> Now, as a human being he is not mere standing-reserve; but as a forester he is.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

as human beings they are not mere standing reserve. But as ... well, what are they? What else might I imagine them to be? Dancers? Filmmakers? Teenagers? How I identify them determines what kind of standing reserve they become. But perhaps end result is the same (thinking Zuboff here). The net effect is -- based on Zuboff -- the same. I see them as dancing reserve. They are a resource waiting to be used. Their screendancing is this resource. Their friendship is this resource. It's devastating. 


> ... these acts [above re standing reserve] occur primarily by our own doing; we belong to the activity. Technological conscriptions of things occur in a sense prior to our actual technical use of [p.72] them, because things must be (and be seen as) already available resources in order for them to be used in this fashion. ... But these technical ends are never ends in themselves: "A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences." This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but instead, "only enters into its circuit," and is "regulating and securing" natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.[@blitz-2014-understanding pp.71-72]

This circularity is a key feature of standing reserve. How might I describe the circularity of these two women? Also am reminded of [[technological forces and recursion]].

see [[Feenberg - From Essentialism to Constructivism#^6a69ce]] for very clear summary of device paradigm and sense of the hiding.


Albert Borgmann is an American scholar working in the philosophy of technology. His book _Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life_ (1984) builds on Heidegger's concept of enframing (Gestell) and introduces two key terms: the _device paradigm_, and _focal things_.

the technology of software and hardware is enframed as a source of friendship expressed through dancing. The software in particular -- and its mathematics -- is hidden. 

The device paradigm is a way of understanding technology as a device or series of devices that deliver commodities, and that the mechanisms for this delivery are hidden. Technology becomes synonymous with devices and not the hidden mechanisms. Which direction is the delivery operating? 

A focal thing is intimately connected to practice and is something that delivers more than one commodity. For example, a hearth is for more than just warmth: it is communal, social, and even a place for cooking and sharing food. 

[[focal activity is a convex lens]] -- they were sending it out into the world: the conditions of lockdown (outdoors), the tech, the nature of friendship.
[[borgmann, effort and focal things]] -- incarnational, effort
[[device paradigm and focal things]] -- but their behaviour definitely operating as a device paradigm
the technology faded into the background. The focal thing hid the device paradigm [[device paradigm and focal things#^fb451d]]

- or something about spirit (their spirit), that in those few minutes, overwhelmed the tech. Something became possible. Something was illuminated through technological affordances. the smartphone became a hearth: enframed, and [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]. (really?) Terrible terrible paradox of our time. Much like Blanco-Borelli discusses. magic trick. 


Harari: deindividuation of the individual (from Talking Politics on Arendt?) into a collective

> The rise of the so-called internet of everything—which involves the incorporation of networked sensors and actuators into everything in the world, including human beings—could enable rational integration and coordination at an unprecedented scale. The historian Yuval Noah Harari argues in his book Homo Deus (2016) that this technology enables the deindividuation of humans into a collective. [Danaher, John & Petersen, Steve. (2020). In Defence of the Hivemind Society. Neuroethics. 10.1007/s12152-020-09451-7.]


## Technopoly and myth

_and call on Alan Jacobs' understanding of the value of myth in the technopoly._

- on acquiring moral life by habituation: [[Jacobs - After Technopoly#^ec599c]]
- Note here about work this writing draws on. Jacobs, Hui.
- part of the awe is the sense of their dancing being _with_ others. That they are networked -- no, this isn't the right word. They are together. Close. Sharing. Seeing and being seen. But see Bauman (<https://notesread.com/liquid-modernity/>) on 'connection' -- and how disconnecting becomes so easy. 

> While the concepts of awe and wonder have a long history in philosophy and religion, James and Maslow helped bring them to psychology. Today, much of the contemporary investigation of awe stems from a 2003 paper, “Approaching Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” written by Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt.47 The authors argued that there are two main cognitive appraisals that are central to awe experiences: the perception of vastness and the struggle to mentally process the experience. Vastness need not be perceptual, such as seeing the Grand Canyon, but can also be conceptual, such as contemplating eternity. Awe is an unusual and complex emotion because it mixes emotions that don’t tend to go with each other, such as ecstasy and fear.[@kaufman-2020-transcend Chapter 7 Peak Experiences n.pag.]


Possible to go to mythical core from [[Jacobs - After Technopoly]] -- do this via that long time/term version of what happened. A long time later. ?? (based on Jacobs)

>... technopoly arises from the technological core of society but produces people who are driven and formed by the mythical core.[@jacobs-2019-technopoly p.4] 

- _how_ does it produce these people formed by the mythical core?

> By contrast, the mythical core of culture is that aspect of experience that is not subject to manipulation, because it is prior to our instrumental reasoning about our environment. Throughout human civilization, says Kołakowski, people have participated in myth -- they may call it "illumination" or "awakening" or something else -- as a way of connecting with "nonempirical unconditioned reality." It is something we enter into with our full being, and all attempts to describe the experience in terms of desire, will, understanding, or literal meaning are ways of trying to force the mythological core into the technological core by analyzing and rationalizing myth and pressing it into a logical order.[@jacobs-2019-technopoly p.3]


- [[media are like metaphors]]
-- see also [[Postman - Amusing Ourselves to Death#technological trade-offs and the printing press]] for note on the trade-offs of technology and also mention of Marx as excellent 'technological affordance' example.

>And the fact that cosmotechnics, as I noted earlier, can be generally described but only locally instantiated makes room for a great deal of creative adaptation.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.41]

- thinking here about the girls' dancing as a local instantiation. But this is compromised by what I imagine is the end game -- posting to TikTok.

> if there is a place in the world for those who treasure a myth that claims to transcend technopoly, it will be, at best, a hidden place. If transnational technopoly can hunt you down and root you out, it will; and it probably can.[@jacobs-2019-technopoly p.13]

Perhaps then screendance ought to stay hidden in plain sight. That there is tremendous value in seeking ways to bypass the bleakest of bleak pictures.

 

Function is data extraction. Simple. But something awe-inspiring as well. Humans making. 

To recognise that the real struggle for screendance practitioners is not between no-tech analogue dancing and the algorithms of social media platforms, but "within the realm of possibilities"[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.301] opened up by this exchange, this social dance, this elemental friendship I witnessed.

## Hidden in the future 

_In which I zoom out into the future to remember a screendance and consider what it might mean for those of us here in the present._

[[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]] -- this is amazing. ;-)

The American writer Stewart Brand proposes that there are "six significant levels of pace and size in the working structure of a robust and adaptable civilization".[@brand-2008-clock p.36] From "fast and attention-getting to slow and powerful"[@brand-2008-clock p.36] the six levels are: fashion/art, commerce, infrastructure, governance, culture and nature. Brand writes how the role of fashion and art is essentially to be "quick, irrelevant, engaging, self-preoccupied, and cruel"[@brand-2008-clock p.36] whereas the "vast slow-motion dance"[@brand-2008-clock p.38] of culture operates through centuries and millennia. Brand suggests that together these distinct and contradictory pace layers provide internal negative feedback that stabilizes and affords the health of civilization. 

So now I'm going to attempt to zoom out in time to the pace of _culture_ according Brand's levels. It is a level or place where time as chronos operates akin to Danny Hillis' _10,000-year clock_ or _The Clock of the Long Now_.[@hillis-1995-millennium] [^ack1] 

[^ack1]: I first read of Hillis' work in Brian Eno's _A Year with Swollen Appendices_ (1995), but was reminded of his work (and Stewart Brand's) while reading Douglas Rushkoff's book _Present Shock_ (2013). This is to acknowledge their influence on this section of the article.

> On a long enough timeline, everything becomes obsolete.[@millburn-2021-love n.pag.] 

Those two young people have grown up, lived their lives and are gone. They are probably survived by family, but maybe not. I am long dead. Perhaps the park is still there? It is common land so hopefully it has not been developed; but I am doubtful. There are parts of the teenagers' phones from 2021 that are still on the planet in some form: lithium, copper, gold, lead, zinc, etc; elemental fragments of devices that once afforded some pleasurable dancing back in 2021 during the pandemic that is almost forgotten. For the most part these elements are in landfill. Those software companies that wielded algorithms to reach through the phone to choreograph or enframe that dancing are long gone too; I can no longer remember their names. They were once so certain and stable; omnipresent. Their algorithms disappeared with them, and have been replaced by old mathematics rethought and recompiled.

I feel none of the vertigo that American media theorist Douglas Rushkoff suggested I might feel if I were to zoom so far out.[-@rushkoff-2013-present] I notice the stillness and slowness, and the absence of sniping chatter. In that stillness I remember seeing a screendance by Annie Pfingst and Helen Poynor called _in Memoriam_ that was first screened in 2016.[-@poynor-2016-memoriam] I saw it at the Light Moves Festival of Screendance in 2018; such a long time ago. This is a film that -- according to Brand's thinking -- is the scale of art operating at the pace of nature. It is kryptonite to that old platform called TikTok that people once used. In the film a single figure inhabits densely forested areas through different seasons. I don't remember there being much movement in the body; indeed my key memory is of the tapestry of the terrain, and of the passing of time. But that was no ordinary time that was passing, even under the machinations and co-ordinates of the long now. 

_in Memoriam_ is—or is it _was_?—a film that treasures myth and seems to resist and transcend technopoly. It is a film in a _hidden place_ seemingly unable to be rooted out, even as the dancer Helen Poynor is enmeshed in the roots of trees and of nature. It exists through its edit and feel in an 
_other_ time. Kairos (thinking that Hillis' clock opens up the terrain or space of myth)

Hidden, seemingly unable to be rooted out. The way it resists time as well (see below notes about long time). That film speaks to those qualities. 

Here, as I write, long into the future, some uncountable years after the screening in Limerick, it seems that it is no mere coincidence that the film was shot in an Iron Age fort; an ancient place of protection, a place by which we recognize the slowness of culture, and the creep of nature. A place where others like us sought shelter, protection and safety. It is, after all, worth remembering that the feeling of safety makes it possible for us to "dare to choose the unknown."[@maslow-2011-psychology p.67]   

This is the kind of screendance that recognizes and understands modes of production and presentation, and pursues new modes. It's grounded in making and process yet somehow manages to avoid the feeling that it was designed for consumption. How can that be? What sleight of hand is at play? The point of making. The craft of making. It resists production. Yet the tension, the paradox, the ambivalence remains. It was always and inevitably heading somewhere. extend this outwards in time ... 




- not saying people should all make films like this one. I don't mean for this to be a question or matter of taste. 
- no longer necessary to take stewardly care. This seems to relate (slightly) to ideas above re zooming out/long now. See [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]] and in particular his discussion of Gerd-Günter Voß (see below). Touches on his writing in [[Jacobs - After Technopoly]] as well -- in the final statements about myth (and discussion of the Mars trilogy book) 
- can make something of the two girls in nature ... the trees, the green grass. Then consider our relationship to nature in, for example, [[Gerd-Günter Voß's three conducts of life#^ca4c17]]

Looking into the "possibility of different technological futures" [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^06b080]] -- this is really beautiful. That we are aware. Implications for screendance? 

"The Anthropocene is the planetarization of standing reserves"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]
"To reopen the question of technology is to refuse this homogeneous technological future that is presented to us as the only option."[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

Then, centuries later, screendance emerged out of the rubble of humankind's soft-shoe-shuffle with the technological singularity. The singularity -- which did not end up happening -- once described the point at which "ever-more-rapid technological change leads to unpredictable consequences"[@chalmers-2010-singularity n.pag.] The technological singularity is the thing that even back in 2017 Hui was calling a pipedream. At some point in the 21st century screendance simply refused the "homogeneous technological future"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.] that had been presented to humankind as the only option.

Yuk Hui's work is to be with philosophy in a way that mine can never be, nor never way.For this reason, I need or rely on his thinking and writing for he is able to think and write philosophically far better than me. What he says here ... _in Memoriam_ does this work. It is not caught in a bubble of screendance; it resists culture. It is heterogenuous. Screendance is a small enough field -- and collection of practices -- to interrograte and indeed resist modes of production and presentation. The field has talked about this for years (examples) but if not now then when? To come out of hiding. To lead. 

See also [[Gelassenheit]] -- Gelassenheit is translated as _releasement_ or _letting go_; "to let things be in whatever may be their uncertainty and their mystery".


## Thanks

Bob Whalley -- introducing me to Yuk Hui's book _The Question Concerning Technology in China_ (which appeared at nearly the same time in some writing I found by Alan Jacobs.)  Instance of [[Baader-Meinhof phenomenon]]. People whose work I have cited. Am grateful for their scholarship and the influence they've had on my thinking and understanding. Love those silent threads between people and ideas.

# Edit bin

Let us also agree that to talk about technology in any guise is to talk about economics. The social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff states in _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ (2019) that "technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action."[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1.V The Puppet Master, Not the Puppet: n.pag.] 

The social psychologist Shoshana Zuboff has a Neil Postman-like attitude towards technology. In _The Age of Surveillance Capitalism_ (2019) Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as the "extractive operations in which our personal experiences are scraped and packaged as the means to others’ ends".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1] The purpose of these hidden extractive operations is to predict our future behaviours and to sell those predictions to advertisers. This mostly hidden economy functions because ata and advertising rule the world.[@noauthor-2017-world]

These two young people on the common during lockdown perform familiar movements of the head and neck -- I've seen similar kinds of movement or dancing in films, and I can sense or remember them in my body. 

It's much more like an ice-berg. That something is being done to these two people beneath the surface of their awareness. The screen is above the water -- we can see its beauty, the way it reflects the sun. But below the surface, the algorithms are extending up into how they move and for how long. 

Low friction technology (convenience, see [[how informs what and this produces culture#^aa0fb6]]) and our behavior, ways of thinking and epistemic understanding change. This is Postman really. This is the printing press. Bench is talking about documentation (is this accurate?). I'm talking about making. Yes, how things are made is changing. That's a given. But what things are made. It goes all the way back to the kinds of dancing. Our focus has been on how technologies influence production, post-production, and presentation. Opportunity here to mention key influences of screendance writing about editing, production (many from IJSD?, Pearlman) But the mode of presentation (this is where we dance now) is inevitably reaching backwards through the film-making 'workflow' into the dancing itself. These are dances enframed by software (more than hardware) and algorithms. But they are also dances of togetherness, pleasure. The hearth? 

- I wonder what the tool is in this example of mine. But certainly it is 'forcing' particular things. Affording others. But it's so early to tell (see Postman and mechanical clock). What is it that we do know or that we can see already happening?

For most of the time preparing and writing this article, I found it difficult to sublimate my sense of dread in what I saw that day. Such a position is simply too easy to adopt. Can we agree that their screendance -- and it is so clearly a dance for screens -- appeared as it did and was performed as it was because of the smartphone they were holding, and its software that will fucntion to swallow them and their dance when they are finished? 

Let me paint that bleakest of bleak pictures. I want to get it out of the way. Not dwell on it. To acknowledge its presence, and the ease with which it can be painted. To give it substance such that we can get to the critical questions of this writing. To recognise that the real struggle for screendance practitioners is not between no-tech analogue dancing and the algorithms of social media platforms, but "within the realm of possibilities"[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.301] opened up by this exchange, this social dance, this elemental friendship I witnessed.

"dance in public is greatly facilitated by the channels of distribution that social media offer, and its meaning is accentuated by other similar circulations"[@bench-2020-perpetual p.65]

This is distinct from ... the kind of dancing in public Bench describes: [[Bench - Perpetual Motion#^266756]]

I trust though that my assumption does not prevent these ideas from having some value to how we might understand social and artistic contexts in screendance. 

I would like to make sense of what I saw that day. In this writing I try to make sense of what I saw that day through _awe_ (note link to Kaufman's Transcend here). I want to recognise and describe the patterns of their trio (two people and a smartphone), and how these patterns Before I do this I need to paint a bleak picture.

This article is about screendance and ... (then say who I think it's for).

-- the fastest growing social media platform among teenagers in the USA, with serious legs in the UK as well.[^stat] Also, there's a 

[^stat]: [statista.com/statistics/250172/social-network-usage-of-us-teens-and-young-adults/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250172/social-network-usage-of-us-teens-and-young-adults/) and [emarketer.com/content/uk-tiktok-sees-explosive-growth-amid-pandemic](https://www.emarketer.com/content/uk-tiktok-sees-explosive-growth-amid-pandemic)

> I think it’ll be useful to differentiate finding implications in this fast-changing social media world versus celebrating or glamorizing social media trends. Because what I also notice is that the life span of a viral dance video is really short! -- Chuyun Oh[@harlig-2021-tiktok p.204]

> So we have a really specific movement style that’s predicated on the technological components, and that continues to reinforce a change in the performance itself. -- Alexandra Harlig[@harlig-2021-tiktok pp.204-205]

Be precise about the technology. It's not so much the smartphone, but the software. And what is this software an instance of? It's not all technology. Not all software.

Postman died in 2003: a year before Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook, three years before Dorsey, Glass, Stone and Williams founded Twitter, four years before the release of the first iPhone, and six years before Facebook added its _like_ button.

In the case of Roth (artist), it would be as if the software's role was to capture the slides and touches of the gesture in his work and then upload them to (most likely) massive Amazon Web Services servers. This is a very very different thing. Much more subtle. Much less direct. But not at all subtle, and utterly direct. Because of course I have no doubt that our screen-based gestures are being uploaded.

### Virality

One part of the picture is the quest for virality. 

Quest for virality. See [[Jacobs - After Technopoly#^cde1fd]] and also [[Blitz - Understanding Heidegger on Technology#^05e7db]]. Also Blanco Borelli and moore discuss virality a lot in their article [[Blanco Borelli and moore - TikTok, Friendship, and Sipping Tea, or How to Endure a Pandemic]]. See also [[Jacobs - After Technopoly#^cde1fd]]

Let's say, for argument's sake, that it is the year 2142. 

-  Radically analogue body.

> For these thinkers modernity continues to be characterized by a unique form of technical action and thought that threatens nontechnical values as it extends itself ever deeper into social life. They argue that technology is not neutral.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism pp.294-295] 

In _Between Faces_,[-@ellis-2018-faces] dance artist Simon Ellis describes how we in screendance ought to take the hyper-presence of smartphones very seriously. He describes how smartphone cameras and screens create a dizzyingly reflexive situation in which we have: "a moving body on screen, a moving body having operated the camera (which is often simply a smartphone screen), and a moving body holding a screen/smart-phone as the video is played back and watched."[@ellis-2018-faces n.pag]

But Ellis leaves out something crucial. He leaves out the part that screendance scholar Erin Brannigan calls pro-filmic events. These "occur in real time at the moment of filming"[@brannigan-2009-microchoreographies p.121] and are distinct from filmic elements inherent to the final screen version. 

But what if anything is pro-filmic about these two people I saw dancing for their smartphone that afternoon?  In theory, yes. But in practice, no. In practice I think they are more deeply involved in simply being friends. The 'filmic' aspect of their behaviour is not something I am privy to, and it is an open question as to how present it is for them. 

It's am ambivalent and paradoxical process. 

- what if include Gutenberg section here but deals with modes of production. The cat is out of the bag. Any gatekeepers of what is and isn't screendance (if there ever were any -- the editors of this journal? the curators of screendance festivals?), or what should or shouldn't be are too late. 


>As I argued in my book Life Inc., the Great Exhibition’s primary intent was to distract the domestic public from the dark underbelly of international industrial modernity. Through this spectacle, Queen Victoria and the corporations she sponsored disconnected these technologies from the human toll they inflicted on their operators. As if in a shopping mall, people gawked, their jaws dropping, at the steam pipes and gears, utterly unaware of the faces and hands the machines burned and mauled. People saw products and production, but never the producers themselves. If anything, industrial modernity was simpler and cleaner than manual labor. As much a welcome step back as a daring leap forward.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding The Short Forever: Act Now, n.pag.]


I didn't want to spend too long gawking, and yet I also sense how their dancing and indeed joy distracted me from the profound choreography of the situation. This is choreography of the kind in which the screen-phone ... Unaware they are burned and mauled (unknown to them). 

Start with Heidegger. inevitable it has been written about so much in dance, and the ways in which technologies have influenced corporeal practices. In the second (?) volume of this journal, Cooper Albright asked four (?) artists to respond to Heidegger.  IJSD -- mention ACA's collection. 

Thinking about Pippa and dancing with her friends. The dancing is a conduit in much the same way the screendancing is a conduit. A way to build, sustain and be in friendship. The screendance is not the point, it is more a by-product of being together. 

]]  (by Hui) and how these definitions might reflect on different aspects of my awe vs dread / myth vs technology. Seems like Kołakowski's thinking (through Jacobs) re technology is quite distinct from Hui's. But I'm not sure. 



Theresa May dancing queen: https://youtu.be/VwRX0mcqSoQ

- could be something about infinite game; tech and production of screendance (regardless of output) is finite, their play is infinite.

This is all a very roundabout way of saying that this article is about screendance and technology, and in it I discuss what is made possible when we work or play with smartphone hardware and software as we dance, and what is lost or compromised. 

### James Bridle and Evan Roth

Bridle discusses a form of architecture called [[parametricism]] in which complex analogue forms are developed from digital tools. He memorably describes such architecture as "eruptions of the digital into the physical world"[@bridle-2011-new n.pag.]. But there's something different going on here. There's no eruption. It's much more like an ice-berg. That something is being done to these two people beneath the surface of their awareness. The screen is above the water -- we can see its beauty, the way it reflects the sun. But below the surface, the digital is reaching up and enframing how they move and for how long. 


Evan Roth's multi-touch finger paintings are useful here. They depict our gestures with phones, with names like _Slide to Unlock_, _User Name and Password_ and _Angry Birds, Level I-1_.[@roth-2012-multitouch] They are simple, and beautiful, and smudgy, not unlike smartphone screens themselves. Reflections tainted by the greasy smudges of our fingers. James Bridle describes Roth's images as "gestures mediated by the machine"[@bridle-2011-new n.pag.] They are images unimaginable before 2007 when the iPhone was launched upon us, yet they are also familiar because of our relationship to thumbprints, and to fingerprint technologies. I am reminded of my pre-teen years and my fascination with how finger prints were (and are) a method to deduce who did what. Roth's paintings are made possible by the machine, and the machine (and more accurately the software) has shaped these gestures. But Roth's awareness is critical. How he draws attention to the gestures as manipulated/mediated by the software-hardware interface. 

>But most people use social media not to unite, not to open their horizons wider, but on the contrary, to cut themselves a comfort zone where the only sounds they hear are the echoes of their own voice, where the only things they see are the reflections of their own face. Social media are very useful, they provide pleasure, but they are a trap.[Zygmunt Bauman, in @dequerol-2016-zygmunt n.pag.]



- friendship, play and the infinite game

I am not interested in discussing teenage use of social media. 

This writing also contains a trap of my own making. It is a trap akin to . 

> Of course, were there no way out of technological thinking, Heidegger's own standpoint, however sophisticated, would also be trapped within it. He attempts to show a way out - a way to think about technology that is not itself beholden to technology.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.69] 

^29940f

- this is really what I'm doing in this essay -- I'm tripping into a way to think about technology that is beholden to it. Right? 

>There is a whole economic system here of which the forester has willy-nilly become a part. Trees make timber, which makes cellulose, which makes paper, which makes newspapers—and because the process is repeated and ongoing, all that material has to be held in "standing-reserve," that is, 

 He likens a swarm to incessant copying of images that no longer have an original, and that each unit of the swarm 

> In a liquid-modern society, swarms tend to replace groups, with their leaders, hierarchies, and pecking orders. A swarm can do without all those paraphernalia without which a group could not exist. Swarms need not be burdened by the group’s tools of survival: they assemble, disperse, and come together again from one occasion to another, each time guided by different, invariably shifting relevancies, and attracted by changing and moving targets.[@bauman-2008-does p.15]

> A swarm can be visualized best as being like Warhol’s endlessly copied images without an original, or with an original that was discarded and impossible to trace and retrieve. Each unit of the swarm reenacts the moves made by the others, while performing the whole job, from beginning to end and in all its parts, alone (in the case of consuming swarms, that job is the job of consuming).[@bauman-2008-does p.16] 

> Every technology is both a burden and a blessing; not either-or, but this-and-that.[@postman-1993-technopoly pp.4-5]

### Technological determinism

Technological determinism is the idea that technological development determines social change or human behaviour. These represent old and rather obvious stories of technology. , , so old that it is a trope one that is little more than a trope or meme. In the _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (1962) Marshall McLuhan wrote ... Heidegger; Determinism.

This is the history of technologies –- affording certain behaviours, preventing others . 

Affordances . Gibson. Technologies afford behaviours 
- two perspectives; one is what is afforded by the interaction and indeed the technology. Technologies afford behaviours. 

The _problem_ is seen everywhere. In dance, technological determinism can be seen as a problem or a possibility. Cooper Albright has written of "how the ubiquity of screens in contemporary dance affects how we watch movement"[@cooperalbright-2012-tensions p.21], and Ellis has described how the hyper-presence of movement on screens has increased screendance literacy[@ellis-2018-faces] 

Again, this is a cliche. We are changed. But how is the question, and do we want this? Or perhaps it's the invisible things (as Postman says) that are the key? 


Zuboff also writes of how "the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people"[-@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] and bypassed the priesthood of that age. She describes the internet as a democratizing power that mirror's Gutenberg's revolution exponentially. The cost however is the hidden processes of data extraction "designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure", that have created a new priesthood of privately owned companies in Silicon Valley. We have been returned to the "pre-Gutenberg order"[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] by this technocratic priesthood which seeks competitive advantage through surveillance, fully weaponised by the printing press of our time. We have been both freed and enslaved.

### Gutenberg and the printing press

In 2015 the dance scholar Harmony Bench wrote an influential article called _Digital Research in Dance Studies: Emerging Trends in a Still-Emerging Field_. Bench wrote of the movement of dance practices, the endless scenarios in which dance occurs, and how video documentation is changing dance: 

>The impact of this unleashing of documentation could not be more profound. [...] Let me be clear: for those of us who produce or conduct research in the areas of dance, movement, and gesture, this is our "Gutenberg."[@bench-2015-digital n.pag.]

To compare unparalleled access to video documentation of dance with the printing press is seductive. But which kind of "Gutenberg" moment is Bench referring to? Ubiquity? Democratization? There is also potential darkness in Bench's comparison. 

sine qua non

add Postman here? Also McLuhan's Gutenberg Galaxy.



> Central to his ideas about culture was his concept of media as "extensions of man." Following this line of thought, he argued that Gutenberg's printing press not only played a role in spreading information, but also in shaping human thought. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2015/09/27/these-4-visionaries-saw-far-into-the-future-heres-how-they-did-it/>

> The point is that the same technology can answer questions differently, depending on the context into which it is introduced and the problem it is designed to solve.[@kranzberg-1986-technology p.546]


>each generation stumbles into the quicksand of forgetting that technology is an expression of other interests. In modern times this means the interests of capital, and in our time it is surveillance capital that commands the digital milieu and directs our trajectory toward the future.[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 1.V. The Puppet Master, Not the Puppet: n.pag.] 

I also understand this writing to be an expression of rationality in the sense that I hope it reveals my interests, understanding, and concerns and how these "shape what is likely, what is pertinent, what is useful, and what matters".[@noe-2015-strange Part I, Chapter 5: Art, Evolution, and the Puzzle of Puzzles, n.pag.] 

> All we presentists get from zooming out to ten-thousand-year time spans is vertigo.[@rushkoff-2013-present]

>we live in a world with multiple timescales, all moving simultaneously but at different speeds. Brand calls it the order of civilization. Nature, or geological time, moves the slowest—like the skater in the middle of the pinwheel. This is the rate at which glaciers carve out canyons or species evolve gills and wings—over eons. On the next level is culture, such as that of the Chinese or the Jews—which lasts millennia. On the next concentric ring comes governance—the rather long-lasting systems of monarchies and republics. The next level is infrastructure—the roads and utilities those governments build and rebuild. Faster yet is commerce that occurs through that infrastructure. And finally the outermost ring is that of fashion—the ever-changing styles and whims that keep the wheels of commerce fed.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

>We could still operate on the timescale of the seasonally changing fashions or TV schedules while remaining cognizant of the greater cycles binding humanity to the cosmos.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

Note also that Rushkoff questions Brand's thinking/practice later in same chapter:

> In other words, what’s it like to envision the ten-thousand-year impact of tossing that plastic bottle into the trash bin, all in the single second it takes to actually toss it? Or the ten-thousand-year history of the fossil fuel being burned to drive to work or iron a shirt? It may be environmentally progressive, but it’s not altogether pleasant. Unless we’re living in utter harmony with nature, thinking in ten-thousand-year spans is an invitation to a nightmarish obsession. It’s a potentially burdensome, even paralyzing, state of mind. Each present action becomes a black hole of possibilities and unintended consequences. We must walk through life as if we had traveled into the past, aware that any change we make—even moving an ashtray two inches to the left—could ripple through time and alter the course of history. It’s less of a Long Now than a Short Forever.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding n.pag] 

Ambivalence and wonder

I've placed xx things on the table: technological determinism, enframing, focal activity, the printing press, and friendship. They seem a long way from these two young people taking pleasure in dancing and videoing their dancing.

See Rushkoff below.

>It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]


My assumed knowledge of what their _play_ was for changes how I see what I see. 

My work here is to understand this technology in a very specific social and artistic context. It is a context for which these hardware and software technologies were not necessarily designed, but nor were they not designed for it. Extrapolation -- the context in which I saw it. First extrapolation: what happened next? Second extrapolation: relevance to screendance. Or perhaps an assumption and an extrapolation. Assumption of what happened next. Extrapoloation into screendance.

**Edit this paragraph (which connects to the one above with Noe quote) to be about what matters and what is useful to screendance.** The technology of the time afforded particular behaviours that included dancing. There was nothing particularly new in the dancing, nor in the recording devices, and certainly nothing particularly new in the social networking software it easy to imagine they will have used after the recording was complete. It certainly is not two friends playing. Is there anything new in what I saw that has some value to the artistic and academic screendance community? Add brief mention here of technological determinism (maybe). This technological dynamic is barely regulated. Zuboff's beef really.

My assumed knowledge of what this "play" is for changes how I see what I see. See [[Rushkoff – Present Shock#^9ab84a]]:

> When we focus on the space around the pieces, we have shifted to the time sensibility of kairos. The space between things matters more than the things themselves. We are thinking less about tinkering with particular objects than about recognizing or influencing the patterns they create and the connections they make.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 4: Fractalnoia -- To Be Or Not To Be, n.pag]

Human beings have a bias towards positive outcomes. This is well documented by what is known as the framing effect[@tversky-1981-framing] in which the same  


And now it's 1976 and I have to be quiet because my sister is recording a TV screening of ABBA through her portable cassette recorder's on-board microphone. Ssshhhh! Later she plays back this lowest of lo-fi recordings and grooves to _Dancing Queen_.[@abba-1976-dancing] My sister at the time is 14 years old, and that shoebox-sized hunk of _modern_ at the time recording technology enforces my silence, if only for 3 minutes and 52 seconds. 

In the ABBA example the technology did not reach out and through the recording device/tech and shape my sister's dancing. The music did. The technology was not absent, nor neutral. ?? It was a technique to enable my sister to listen to the song. 

Is there anything _new_ in what I observed that afternoon? Was their behaviour so different from my sister recording and then dancing to ABBA? 

[[the framing effect]] - how I present what I saw matters 

Two versions of the same thing! Possible?


This text is a series of projections and confabulations disguised as an attempt to understand and communicate my ambivalence and wonder regarding what I saw that afternoon in a park on the outskirts of London during lockdown. But before I get to ambivalence and wonder, I need to take three steps backwards.

What is the "new" behaviour here? Anything to do with screendance? It's not new behaviour as such, and yet it's entirely new. Both new and old. Is there anything new in what I saw? It isn't the dancing; it isn't recording devices; it likely isn't even the social networking software I imagine they'll use to share their dancing afterwards. It certainly isn't two friends playing. 

>The particular tone of the sage’s skepticism is ironic, and the sage is in some essential sense an ironist, but his irony is always directed primarily toward himself. Indeed, this is precisely why people should seek him out to govern them: His primary qualification for office is the gently humorous attitude he takes toward himself, which then extends outward toward our technological "enframing" of the world. [@jacobs-2021-tech p.40]

- thinking here of the tone of my voice in this writing. What would it be like to smile at the tech and ignore it in this case? To write a section dealing with the mess of nature/stewardly care, but then to ask the reader to ignore it. That that section is a version of myself that is more troubling, less important. Worth ignoring, or perhaps, at best, just smiling at. Can I mock the tech? 

Zuboff uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process. On one side are the technologies of surveillance capitalism that are designed to "render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.1] On the other side is the fact that "every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to 'datafication'".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.1] We _render_ "unto surveillance capitalism" a continuous supply of raw materials. 

Most importantly for this writing, the rendition of our bodies begins quite simply with our phones.[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.2] 

>the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people, rescuing the prayers, bypassing the priesthood, and delivering the opportunity for spiritual communion directly into the hands of the prayerful. We have come to take for granted that the internet enables an unparalleled diffusion of information, promising more knowledge for more people: a mighty democratizing force that exponentially realizes Gutenberg’s revolution in the lives of billions of individuals. But this grand achievement has blinded us to a different historical development, one that moves out of range and out of sight, designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure. In this hidden movement the competitive struggle over surveillance revenues reverts to the pre-Gutenberg order as the division of learning in society shades toward the pathological, captured by a narrow priesthood of privately employed computational specialists, their privately owned machines, and the economic interests for whose sake they learn.[@zuboff-2019-age n.pag.]


"surveillance capitalism" revenues a development that ... the products of which are about prediction. Prediction of us, our future behaviour, our futures.  

the "unprecedented" world of surveillance capitalism. We don't yet know what to do. It has not been seen before.
