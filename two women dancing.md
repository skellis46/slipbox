# two women dancing

## two girls dancing and lockdown

They are two young women, perhaps 14 years old. They are playing together in a park in early March 2021 during the UK's second national lockdown. I am walking past, wary of watching or intruding, but also captivated by what they are doing. 

They are dancing for each other; or, each of them is dancing for the other who is recording the dancing on a smartphone held in portrait mode. The camera and the dancer are close to each other; it's a close-up. They take turns dancing or recording, then watching the short dance together, pointing at the small screen, and laughing freely and loudly. 

The dancing itself is mostly movement in the head and neck; a kind of rolling or looping of the head side to side around the transverse axis. It's very specific, and it is playfully performed. As a trio -- two women and a camera -- they are lost in their own world; enamored with the game. The movement or sequence is pretty much the same short length every time, as if they are trying to perfect the performance of the moves, or perfect the recording of the performances.

From the outside (well, this is all from the outside really), their game (like so many open-ended games) seems to be on repeat. Even the repetition of the movement has a quality of being able to be reversed, repeated or played back. Each dance is exquisitely brief, and not linear or forward seeking. It is as if there is a visual glitch in their matrix as they play. 

By this stage I'm way past where it is that they are playing, and it is also clear that in this writing I've already projected an enormous amount onto what they were doing. 

The park or common is part of a series of commons not far from where I live. It's not _nature_ as such but it's close enough to feel like they have unwittingly fallen into the trope of screendance recorded in nature (ref).

I'm taking my permitted one hour of outdoor exercise.

This screendance – it really is a dance for screens – is only happening in this way because of these technologies. This is the history of technologies – affording certain behaviours, preventing others. Flashback to the late 1970s and I remember being begged to stay silent as my sister recorded TV performances of ABBA through her portable cassette recorder's onboard microphone. Later she would playback these lowest of lo-fi recordings and  dance to the Dancing Queen.[ref] 

-- dancing, watching, dancing. But this instance. This thing. is very different. 

What is the "new" behaviour here? Anything to do with screendance?

## Technological determinism

"how the ubiquity of screens in contemporary dance affects how we watch movement"[@cooperalbright-2012-tensions p.21]

Affordances . Gibson. Technologies afford behaviours 
- two perspectives; one is what is afforded by the interaction and indeed the technology. Technologies afford behaviours. 

>It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]

- second perspective is very wide-angle. no longer necessary to take stewardly care. See [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]]<jacobs-2021-from.pdf> and in particular this discussion of Gerd-Günter Voß
- can make something of the two girls in nature ... the trees, the green grass. Then consider our relationship to nature in, for example, [[Gerd-Günter Voß's three conducts of life]]

>The particular tone of the sage’s skepticism is ironic, and the sage is in some essential sense an ironist, but his irony is always directed primarily toward himself. Indeed, this is precisely why people should seek him out to govern them: His primary qualification for office is the gently humorous attitude he takes toward himself, which then extends outward toward our technological “enframing” of the world. [@jacobs-2021-tech p.40]

- thinking here of the tone of my voice in this writing. What would it be like to smile at the tech and ignore it in this case? To write a section dealing with the mess of nature/stewardly care, but then to ask the reader to ignore it. That that section is a version of myself that is more troubling, less important. Worth ignoring, or perhaps, at best, just smiling at. Can I mock the tech? 

>And the fact that cosmotechnics, as I noted earlier, can be generally described but only locally instantiated makes room for a great deal of creative adaptation.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.41]

- thinking here about the girls' dancing as a local instantiation. But this is compromised by what I imagine is the end game -- posting to tic tok.

## This is our 'Gutenberg'

In 2015 the dance scholar and former co-editor of the International Journal of Screendance wrote an influential article called _Digital Research in Dance Studies: Emerging Trends in a Still-Emerging Field_. Bench wrote of the movement of dance practices, the endless scenarios in which dance occurs, and how video documentation is changing dance: 

>The impact of this unleashing of documentation could not be more profound. [...] Let me be clear: for those of us who produce or conduct research in the areas of dance, movement, and gesture, this is our “Gutenberg.”[@bench-2015-digital n.pag.]

The comparison of unparalleled access to video documentation of dance with the printing press is seductive. But which kind of "Gutenberg" moment is Bench referring to? Ubiquity? Democratization? There is also potential darkness in Bench's comparison. 

add Postman here?

In Shoshana Zuboff's _Surveillance Capitalism_ she reminds us that "the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people"[-@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] and bypassed the priesthood. The internet, according to Zuboff, is a massive democratizing force that mirror's Gutenberg's revolution exponentially. The cost

>the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people, rescuing the prayers, bypassing the priesthood, and delivering the opportunity for spiritual communion directly into the hands of the prayerful. We have come to take for granted that the internet enables an unparalleled diffusion of information, promising more knowledge for more people: a mighty democratizing force that exponentially realizes Gutenberg’s revolution in the lives of billions of individuals. But this grand achievement has blinded us to a different historical development, one that moves out of range and out of sight, designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure. In this hidden movement the competitive struggle over surveillance revenues reverts to the pre-Gutenberg order as the division of learning in society shades toward the pathological, captured by a narrow priesthood of privately employed computational specialists, their privately owned machines, and the economic interests for whose sake they learn.[@zuboff-2019-age n.pag.]

What is the new tool in this exchange? It isnt dancing. It isnt recording devices? Is it the social software - tic toc
they are playing. but the technology is also playing them? infinite game ... but with a brutal and less than benign heartbeat? Heidegger's standing reserve. See p.31 of [jacobs-2021-from]. They become standing reserve for tic toc. But I don't want to see it in this way. This is the finite game we are all playing. 

[[pro-filmic events occur in real time at the moment of filming]] -- but they are more than this. They are being. friends. It's am ambivalent and paradoxical process. The 'filmic' is certainly irrelevant from my perspective, but I imagine from theirs (but not entirely).
