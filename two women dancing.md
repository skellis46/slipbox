# Ambivalence and wonder in three minutes of dancing

## Abstract

This is some writing about ambivalence and wonder. I attempt to wrestle with the messiness of play while we are each waiting in [[Heidegger's standing reserve]] -- ready but unwilling to be hoovered up.

## Dance, record, watch, point and laugh

I am out for a walk, doing my one hour of permitted outdoor exercise. It is March 2021 and we are nearing the end of the UK's second national lockdown. 

They are two young people, perhaps 14 years old, playing together in a park. The area is not nature as such but it is also definitely not the city. 

I am walking past them, wary of watching or intruding, but also captivated by their play. They are dancing for each other. Or rather, one of them is dancing for the other who is recording the dancing on a smartphone held in portrait mode. The camera and the dancer are close to each other; it's a close-up. They take turns: they dance, record, watch, point at the screen and laugh.

The dancing itself is mostly movement in the head and neck; rolling the head side to side around the frontal axis. It is a specific action, and is playfully performed. The movement is more or less the same short sequence every time, as if they are trying to perfect the performance of the moves, or perfect the recording of the performances. This trio of two young people and their camera are deep in their own world. Their game -- like so many open-ended games -- seems to be on repeat. The repetition of the movement has a quality of being able to be reversed, repeated or played back. Each dance is exquisitely brief, and not linear or forward seeking. It is as if there is a visual glitch in their matrix. 

By this stage I'm way past where it is they are dancing. It has been no more than three minutes since I first saw them.

The screendance -- and it is so clearly a dance for screens -- is only happening in this way because of that smartphone they are holding, as well as the software that will gratefully swallow them and their dance when they are finished. Instagram Stories? TikTok? 

And now it's 1976 and I have to be quiet because my sister is recording a TV screening of ABBA through her portable cassette recorder's on-board microphone. Ssshhhh! Later she plays back this lowest of lo-fi recordings and grooves to the _Dancing Queen_.[@abba-1976-dancing] My sister is 14 years old, and that strange box of technology silences me, if only for 3 minutes and 52 seconds. 

This text is a series of projections and confabulations disguised as an attempt to understand and communicate my deep ambivalence and wonder regarding what I saw that afternoon.

## Technological determinism

Technological determinism is the idea that technological development determines social change or human behaviour. The _problem_ is seen everywhere. In dance, Cooper Albright has written of "how the ubiquity of screens in contemporary dance affects how we watch movement"[@cooperalbright-2012-tensions p.21]. 

Again, this is a cliche. We are changed. But how is the question, and do we want this? See Rushkoff below.

These represent old and rather obvious stories of technology. , , so old that it is a trope one that is little more than a trope or meme. In the _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (1962) Marshall McLuhan wrote ... Heidegger; Determinism.

This is the history of technologies – affording certain behaviours, preventing others . 

What is the "new" behaviour here? Anything to do with screendance? It's not new behaviour as such, and yet it's entirely new. Both new and old. Is there anything new in what I saw? It isn't the dancing; it isn't recording devices; it likely isn't even the social networking software I imagine they'll use to share their dancing afterwards. It certainly isn't two friends playing. Is there anything new in what I saw that has some value to the artistic and academic screendance community?

they are playing. but the technology is also playing them? infinite game ... but with a brutal and less than benign heartbeat? [[Heidegger's standing reserve]]. See p.31 of [jacobs-2021-from]. They become standing reserve for TikTok. But I don't want to see it in this way. This is the finite game we are all playing as digital technologies predicated on the attention economy play us. 

As social media subjects they are standing reserve; mere commodities for ... But as human beings, they are not.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

Affordances . Gibson. Technologies afford behaviours 
- two perspectives; one is what is afforded by the interaction and indeed the technology. Technologies afford behaviours. 

>It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]

- second perspective is very wide-angle. no longer necessary to take stewardly care. This seems to relate (slightly) to ideas above re zooming out/long now. See [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]] and in particular his discussion of Gerd-Günter Voß (see below)
- can make something of the two girls in nature ... the trees, the green grass. Then consider our relationship to nature in, for example, [[Gerd-Günter Voß's three conducts of life]]

>The particular tone of the sage’s skepticism is ironic, and the sage is in some essential sense an ironist, but his irony is always directed primarily toward himself. Indeed, this is precisely why people should seek him out to govern them: His primary qualification for office is the gently humorous attitude he takes toward himself, which then extends outward toward our technological “enframing” of the world. [@jacobs-2021-tech p.40]

- thinking here of the tone of my voice in this writing. What would it be like to smile at the tech and ignore it in this case? To write a section dealing with the mess of nature/stewardly care, but then to ask the reader to ignore it. That that section is a version of myself that is more troubling, less important. Worth ignoring, or perhaps, at best, just smiling at. Can I mock the tech? 

>And the fact that cosmotechnics, as I noted earlier, can be generally described but only locally instantiated makes room for a great deal of creative adaptation.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.41]

- thinking here about the girls' dancing as a local instantiation. But this is compromised by what I imagine is the end game -- posting to tic tok. 

## Being friends

In _Between Faces_,[-@ellis-2018-faces] dance artist Simon Ellis describes how we in screendance ought to take the hyper-presence of smartphones very seriously. He describes how smartphone cameras and screens create a dizzyingly reflexive situation in which we have: "a moving body on screen, a moving body having operated the camera (which is often simply a smartphone screen), and a moving body holding a screen/smart-phone as the video is played back and watched."[@ellis-2018-faces n.pag]

But Ellis leaves out something crucial. He leaves out the part that screendance scholar Erin Brannigan calls pro-filmic events. These "occur in real time at the moment of filming"[@brannigan-2009-microchoreographies p.121] and are distinct from filmic elements inherent to the final screen version. T

The extent to which these two young people are engaged in something pro-filmic is also doubtful. In theory, yes. But in practice, no. In practice I think they are more deeply involved in simply being friends. The 'filmic' aspect of their behaviour is not something I am privy to, and it is an open question as to how present it is for them. 

It's am ambivalent and paradoxical process.

## This is our 'Gutenberg'

In 2015 the dance scholar and former co-editor of the International Journal of Screendance wrote an influential article called _Digital Research in Dance Studies: Emerging Trends in a Still-Emerging Field_. Bench wrote of the movement of dance practices, the endless scenarios in which dance occurs, and how video documentation is changing dance: 

>The impact of this unleashing of documentation could not be more profound. [...] Let me be clear: for those of us who produce or conduct research in the areas of dance, movement, and gesture, this is our “Gutenberg.”[@bench-2015-digital n.pag.]

To compare unparalleled access to video documentation of dance with the printing press is seductive. But which kind of "Gutenberg" moment is Bench referring to? Ubiquity? Democratization? There is also potential darkness in Bench's comparison. 

add Postman here?

In Shoshana Zuboff's _Surveillance Capitalism_ she reminds us that "the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people"[-@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] and bypassed the priesthood. The internet, according to Zuboff, is a massive democratizing force that mirror's Gutenberg's revolution exponentially. The cost

>the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people, rescuing the prayers, bypassing the priesthood, and delivering the opportunity for spiritual communion directly into the hands of the prayerful. We have come to take for granted that the internet enables an unparalleled diffusion of information, promising more knowledge for more people: a mighty democratizing force that exponentially realizes Gutenberg’s revolution in the lives of billions of individuals. But this grand achievement has blinded us to a different historical development, one that moves out of range and out of sight, designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure. In this hidden movement the competitive struggle over surveillance revenues reverts to the pre-Gutenberg order as the division of learning in society shades toward the pathological, captured by a narrow priesthood of privately employed computational specialists, their privately owned machines, and the economic interests for whose sake they learn.[@zuboff-2019-age n.pag.]


- [[Rushkoff – Present Shock#^1394a7]]: thinking here about those two women. And now I'm thinking by zooming out in time. Zooming way way out. Those women have grown up, lived their lives and are gone. I'm long gone. The park is likely still there; it's common land so not likely to have been developed. The parts of their phones are still here (list main things that last and how long). Fragments of something. Something special. But small. Stewart Brand's _The Clock of the Long Now_.

>we live in a world with multiple timescales, all moving simultaneously but at different speeds. Brand calls it the order of civilization. Nature, or geological time, moves the slowest—like the skater in the middle of the pinwheel. This is the rate at which glaciers carve out canyons or species evolve gills and wings—over eons. On the next level is culture, such as that of the Chinese or the Jews—which lasts millennia. On the next concentric ring comes governance—the rather long-lasting systems of monarchies and republics. The next level is infrastructure—the roads and utilities those governments build and rebuild. Faster yet is commerce that occurs through that infrastructure. And finally the outermost ring is that of fashion—the ever-changing styles and whims that keep the wheels of commerce fed.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

>We could still operate on the timescale of the seasonally changing fashions or TV schedules while remaining cognizant of the greater cycles binding humanity to the cosmos.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

## edit bin

This is a story about ambivalence, perhaps even moral ambivalence. 

[[pro-filmic events occur in real time at the moment of filming]] -- but they are more than this. They are being. friends. It's am ambivalent and paradoxical process. The 'filmic' is certainly irrelevant from my perspective, but I imagine from theirs (but not entirely). 
 
and it is also clear that in this writing I've already projected an enormous amount onto what they were doing. 


that what follows is provoked by what I saw that afternoon during 2 or 3 brief minutes. 

-- dancing, watching, dancing. But this instance. This thing. is very different. 


They are the so-called fourth screens, the screens that have come after cinema, after television, and after the computer.[@miller-2014-fourth]


From the outside (well, this is all from the outside really), their game (like so many 

it's close enough to feel like they have unwittingly fallen into the trope of screendance recorded in nature (ref).
