# speeding to go slow

There's a rather famous essay in the tech world written by the artist Craig Mod called [Fast Software](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/). In it Mod writes how "Fast software gives the user a chance to 'meld' with its toolset. That is, not break flow." I'm writing this in software called [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). It's my favourite piece of software by some distance. It's really for software developers writing code but I write everything in it. It's fast (super fast), powerful ([multiple cursors editing](https://youtu.be/TzkYk4CdvBk) blew my mind the first time I saw it being used) and it never ever crashes or gets in the way of the act of writing. Its style or form of digital presence is to disappear into absence so that I can just write. 

Sublime Text got me thinking about choreography. Because, as you will well know, choreography is described in many many ways but nearly all descriptions of it refer in some way to time. The extent to which dancing is working with and in time is what makes it riveting to do (and occasionally to watch). When teenagers in a club are _in_ the dancing, they are lost in the time of the dancing. It is the trope of [Csíkszentmihályi's flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi#Flow) as they compress, flex, mess with and roll into time. Because perhaps dancing is time as [kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos): "the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular."

Dancing as kairos reminds me of that startling film by [Babette Mangolte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babette_Mangolte) of [Trisha Brown dancing _Watermotor_](https://youtu.be/3FALHd5Viz4). Brown's movements teem with possibility and abandon, but I never feel as if she as dancer -- and I as watcher -- are being rushed. There is speed without rush, that seems to make slowness possible. And then, of course, Mangolte so gently slows the footage down which only makes Brown's dancing richer for its density and pace. 

Which is why I like to imagine tools or even movements as being things that have the capacity to work quickly so that I might think or go or reflect slowly. That in all of the speeding and the zooming there are opportunities for slowness. Indeed, the speeding affords slowness.
