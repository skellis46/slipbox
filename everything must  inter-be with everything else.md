# everything must inter-be with everything else

_previous note:_ [[becoming sensible within atmospheric conditions]]

> "The one who bows and the one who is bowed to are the same." Both are without a separate self. When we look deeply into a flower, we can see the sun, the clouds, seeds, the nutrients in the soil, and many other things. We understand that the flower cannot exist as a separate, independent self. It is made entirely of what we can call "non-flower elements." The one who bows and the one who is bowed to are of the same nature. I am made of non-me elements. The Buddha is made of non-Buddha elements. Nothing can exist by itself alone. Everything has to inter-be with everything else in the cosmos.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.144]

> I am one with all people and all species whether they are peaceful and fearless, or suffering and afraid. At this very moment I am present everywhere on this planet. I am also present in the past and in the future. The disintegration of this body does not touch me, just as when the plum blossom falls it does not mean the end of the plum tree.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.178]
