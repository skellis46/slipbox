# define your terms

_previous note:_ [[somatics unlimited]]

“Define your terms … or we shall never understand one another.”10 This admonition from the eighteenth-century philosopher Voltaire is a challenge for anyone talking about artificial intelligence, because its central notion—intelligence—remains so ill-defined. Marvin Minsky himself coined the phrase “suitcase word”11 for terms like intelligence and its many cousins, such as thinking, cognition, consciousness, and emotion. Each is packed like a suitcase with a jumble of different meanings. Artificial intelligence inherits this packing problem, sporting different meanings in different contexts.

- made me think of those suitcase words like consciousness, attention, awareness, intention

The eighteenth-century French philosopher Voltaire wrote simply:

> Define your terms ... or we shall never understand one another.[@mitchell-2019-artificial loc 286]
