# memories and feelings do not communicate directly in words

_previous note:_ [[transparencies feeling through images bid proposal]]

> Memories and feelings do not communicate directly in words -- they flow whether or not they are being noticed or believed. When people pause to describe or explain them, this very act automatically alters what is being experienced or observed. This is the reason that the nonverbal sensory-based Therapies are the most appropriate approaches for working with the primarily visual metaphorical language of the unconscious, especially PhotoTherapy or Art Therapy (or, even better, both combined).
