# Blitz - Understanding Heidegger on Technology

> In his later writings on technology, which mainly concern us in this essay, Heidegger draws attention to technology's place in bringing about our decline by constricting our experience of things as they are. He argues that we now view nature, and increasingly human beings too, only technologically - that is, we see nature and people only as raw material for technical operations. Heidegger seeks to illuminate this phenomenon and to find a way of thinking by which we might be saved from its controlling power, to which, he believes, modern civilization both in the communist East and the democratic West has been shackled. We might escape this bondage, Heidegger argues, not by rejecting technology, but by perceiving its danger.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.63]

> The study of Heidegger is both dangerous and difficult—the way he is taught today threatens to obscure his thought's connection to his politics while at the same time transforming his work into fodder for the aimless curiosity of the academic industry. Heidegger would not be surprised to discover that he is now part of the problem that he meant to address. Bu if, as Heidegger hoped, his works are to help us understand the challenge technology presents, we must study him both carefully and cautiously—carefully, to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, an cautiously, in light of his association with the Nazis.
