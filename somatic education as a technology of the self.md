# somatic education as a technology of the self

_previous note:_ [[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

Fortin et al suggest that somatic practices can function as a technology of the self (as opposed to technologies of domination). Both technologies are Foucault's thinking.  

> In retrieving the capacity to feel and observe what was escaping their critical consciousness, individuals can allow themselves to resist technologies of domination. This idea is also found in Shusterman: ‘If it is true that oppressive relations of power impose a weighty identity encoded in our very own body, then these relations of oppression can be put into question by marginal somatic practices’ (1992: 68).[@fortin-2009-experience pp.49-50]
