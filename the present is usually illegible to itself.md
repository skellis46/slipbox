# the present is usually illegible to itself

_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

> The present is usually illegible to itself, and its assumptions can be glimpsed only by hermeneutics other than its own.[@burges-2016-introduction p.2]


Their footnote to this text is as follows:

> This is a standard operating principle for practicing historians. For an extended consideration of this point, see the final two chapters of Fredric Jameson, Valences of the Dialectic (London and New York: Verso, 2010), and Evan Calder Williams, Combined and Uneven Apocalypse (Winchester, UK: Zero Books, 2011). [@burges-2016-introduction p.28]

- made me think about [[dance and embodiment (working title)]] and wondering about what kind of hermeneutics I might be proposing to understand the 'present' of somatic practices; that part of my thinking is about examining or even just glimpsing those assumptions
