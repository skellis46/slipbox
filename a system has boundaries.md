# a system has boundaries

_previous note:_ [[a border is not a boundary]]

This note is about an online essay by Hannah Close about systems theory.

> Curtis disdains the machine metaphor present at the heart of the term ‘ecosystem’ (which heavily influences, and is influenced by systems theory/thinking). He recounts the origins of the term as coming from Freud’s analogy of the human mind to an electrical ‘system’, which later inspired the ecologist Arthur Tansley to coin the term ‘ecosystem’ in 1935, now revered by contemporary ecologists and environmentalists across the globe.


> The nature of a system is that is has boundaries, and according to systems theory, these boundaries can be applied to the natural and ‘unnatural’ world (a contested notion). For example, a coral reef is a system, a city is a system, and if we get granular we can also say that a bathtub is a system.
