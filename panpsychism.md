# panpsychism

_previous note:_ [[harris - conscious]]

> If we can’t point to anything that distinguishes which collections of atoms in the universe are conscious from those that aren’t, where can we possibly hope to draw the line? Perhaps a more interesting question is why we should draw a line at all. When we view our own experience of consciousness as being “along for the ride,” we suddenly find it easier to imagine that other systems are accompanied by consciousness as well. It’s at this point that we must consider the possibility that all matter is imbued with consciousness in some sense—a view referred to as panpsychism.1 (Location 586)


> I love the title of an article by the philosopher Philip Goff: “[Panpsychism Is Crazy, but It’s Also Most Probably True](https://aeon.co/ideas/panpsychism-is-crazy-but-its-also-most-probably-true).” His line of thinking follows this path: Once we realise that physics tells us nothing about the intrinsic nature of the entities it talks about, and indeed that the only thing we know for certain about the intrinsic nature of matter is that at least some material things have experience . . . the theoretical imperative to form as simple and unified a view as is consistent with the data leads us quite straightforwardly in the direction of panpsychism.2 (Location 604)


> The natural tendency of scientific exploration is to arrive at as simple an explanation as possible, and the concept of consciousness emerging out of nonconscious material represents a kind of failure of the typical goal of scientific explanation. In philosophy, this jump from a nonconscious to a conscious state of matter is referred to as “radical” or “strong” emergence.3 (Location 623)
