Empirical research is a way of gaining knowledge through direct or indirect observation or experience. This evidence can be analysed quantitatively or qualitatively. It uses empirical evidence; that is, evidence gathered through the senses.

In the [Twelve Virtues of Rationality](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/twelve-virtues-of-rationality), Eliezer Yudkowsky has empiricism as the sixth virtue: 

>The roots of knowledge are in observation and its fruit is prediction.
