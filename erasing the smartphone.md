# erasing the smartphone

_previous note:_ [[technopoly in the west deploys carrots rather than sticks]]

> On day one, I always put [Jon’s question](https://substack.com/redirect/390cf22e-93a3-4e85-8722-ad90e9fb3d8b?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) to my class: *if you could erase the smartphone and social media from ever having existed, would you do it?* Over the past three years, 81% of them have said ‘yes’.¹ These students are of course not representative of the general student population, but even if the real number were something like 50%, something very funny is going on. I ask them: can you think of a new technology, at any point in history, where half of its primary *users* quickly wished that it had never been invented?


> What other tech is like this? The only clear analogue my students usually come up with is the nuclear bomb. Famously, creators and possessors of the bomb often fervently wished they could put that genie back into that bottle. Yet, what does it say about the smartphone and social media that their clearest analogue here is a technology that could easily destroy the entire surface of the earth several times over? Why do so many of my students express a growing sentiment among young people, a nostalgia for what Freya India called “[A Time We Never Knew](https://substack.com/redirect/342d0439-2e20-478e-9234-a8234c1815b3?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)”?


> My students, upon encountering McLuhan’s idea, immediately see that the smartphone and its typical apps must also be communicating such messages. This year, they offered these examples: *your voice matters, people want to see you, you can be popular.*
