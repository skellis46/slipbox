# nahr workshop notes

_previous note:_ [[footfall]]

_Rather random set of notes from workshop held at NAHR on weekend of 4 and 5 June, 2022._

## 4 June 2022

- "the land as a museum"
- They live in a museum. It is a museum that ... 
- Theophrastus (371-286) - father of botany - layers of soil: surface, subsoil, substrate, tartaro (inferno)
- coats of soil emerged like a film
- soil is 5% organic matter: both living a dead matter
- Alessandro (Longhi) said something about horizons. Here it is: soil horizons: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_horizon>:

> A soil horizon is a layer parallel to the soil surface whose physical, chemical and biological characteristics differ from the layers above and beneath. Horizons are defined in many cases by obvious physical features, mainly colour and texture. 

- the main soil horizons are organic (O), surface (A), subsoil (B), substratum (C), and bedrock (R)

- Pedology: "understanding and characterizing soil formation, evolution, and the theoretical frameworks for modeling soil bodies, often in the context of the natural environment" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedology>
- illuviation vs eluviation: 

> The removal of material from a soil layer is called eluviation. The transport of the material may be either mechanical or chemical. The process of deposition of illuvium is termed illuviation. [Illuviation] is a water-assisted transport in a basically vertical direction, as compared to alluviation, the horizontal running water transfer. The resulting deposits are called illuvial deposits<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuvium>

- root system to cope with instability of scree
- buccia: peel, skin, "strato esterno"
- there is nothing untouched
- the dignity of a place 
- this land is all touched
- what happens under our feet
- Hans Jonas: The imperative of responsibility, see in [[future responsibility and stewardship]]
- soil "disappears"
- thinking through decomposition
- I'm imagining multiple scales (perhaps a bit like an infographic, or perhaps even Richard McGuire's _Here_ -- discussed in Gardner's writing; here's a related note: [[film and comics share the genetic code of sequential images]]), as if these scales are happning in multiple areas or panels or times? 
- plants feed the soil
- humus: "humus is the dark organic matter in soil that is formed by the decomposition of plant and animal matter. It is a kind of soil organic matter" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humus>); comes from Latin word for earth or ground.
- What is it to be alive now? Perculiar to this time? Not just the feeling of uniqueness that must surely be common to all generations. That's not _different_. But is there something about the suspicion, the guilt, the anguish, the helplessness, the confusion? What is this feeilng? How might I describe it? 
- "all the world is a garden" - Titta said this

## 5 June 2022

- virgin land = untouched
- what is not seen has the greatest impact (talking about buildings and construction)
- that which is unseen / invisible
- discussing permeability and impermeability -- e.g. concrete
- Mother Earth: maternal, creativity, reproduction - like archetypes
- transformation / metamorphosis
- ritual 
- commonality / common good
- to be in common
- to commune
- Emilio: I cannot take profit from something I participate in (or am responsible for) -- as if it doesn't make sense.
- Emilio: there is a lack of love
	- to love and be loved
	- thinking of Barthes _A Lovers Discourse_
- ego <=> eco 
- to set in motion 
- to put things in place
- the very least one can do
- single-use objects or instruments are unable to be transformed: thinking here of how much space for people's imaginations in this work?
- to bring into the foreground / from the background to the foreground
- to make soil the subject: The soil is that which I am walking on. (Ilaria discussed this a lot). That whatever happens it must not remain an object in the background.  ^3af8ce
- where do we come from -- parents, family, place (Juan did this in workshop -- the only one). He described being imprinted by his past.
- Juan mentioned mafia hiding toxic materials underground
	- like an invasion, or something invasive
- he described Earth as material and planet 
- clay "almost as hard as stone"
- baking clay = first technological act / "technological gesture"
- "extraction and subsequent transformation" - from Juan's text
- immaterial as aura
- time, transformational matter. 
	- What is transformed? (in the body)
