# the wider body politic

_previous note:_ [[Claxton - Intelligence in the Flesh]]

> If I see myself as a ghostly mind, it is easy to feel that I am an isolated and self-contained individual: a localised bubble of consciousness. But if I am a body, first and foremost, then I am already deeply connected. Once I really get that mind is the conscious accomplice of the body, not its governor, I can’t avoid seeing myself as an aspect of the wider body social and body politic.3 As cells are to the physical body, so people are to the larger ‘corporations’ to which they belong. Embodied implies embedded. [@claxton-2015-intelligence] 

Thinking this is useful for Scott and I talking of the body problem, but also in any confrontation or alignment with inter-disciplinary thinking
