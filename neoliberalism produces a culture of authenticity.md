# neoliberalism produces a culture of authenticity

_previous note:_ [[doxa and habitus]]

This is from an interview between Gesine Borcherdt and the philosopher Byung-Chul Han. 

> Neoliberalism produces a culture of authenticity, which places the ego at its centre. The culture of authenticity develops a suspicion of ritualised forms of interaction. Only spontaneous emotions, subjective states, are authentic. Modelled behaviour, for example courtesy, is written off as inauthentic or superficial. The narcissistic cult of authenticity is partly responsible for the increasing brutality of society.[Han, in @borcherdt-2021-byungchul n.pag.]

- I need to understand more about cult of authenticity and brutality. What brutality is he referring to? 
- love the shift from _culture_ to _cult_
