# other ways to perceive the sky, air and atmosphere

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> We acknowledge and seek to address the historical trauma (Pihama et al. 2014) that indigenous communities continue to experience as a result of the failure of settler colonial society to imagine other ways of perceiving the sky, air and atmosphere beyond Eurocentric measures.[@brown-2020-hau p.73]

Brown and Reihana-Morunga discuss this idea further:

> The science of weather measurement – meteorology – has contributed much to our understanding of the weather and weather changes but, like the doomed life of FitzRoy, it has failed to cultivate an environmental imagination that speaks to the character of the weather, its animate qualities as a transmitter of cultural movement, knowledge, spirituality and a multi-dimensional worldview. We ask how the electronic breaths of weather science readings contain traces and signs of colonialism’s history of violence and exclusions?[@brown-2020-hau p.74]

_thoughts & links:_

- very complex idea this, particularly re the [[search for truth]] and also the power of science to deepen our understanding of how (in this case) weather functions. 
- see also [[heterotopic discourse and the truth]] and how truth is not located in single voice
- how is that historical trauma being addressed? (by imagining other ways of perceiving) Is it even possible to address such a thing? What are the effects of such an 'addressal'?
- but utterly agree that it's a failure of imagination; contrast with Graeber and Wengrow and how [[a city is raised in the imagination]]
- perhaps the hyper-specialisation of science is predicated on funnelling the imagination into an ever-decreasing radius?
- linking to Brown and Reihana-Morunga in [[the slow violence of environmental destruction]]
- perhaps in my skepticism here is about trying to convince scientists that something is missing for them? That there is something for them to gain in their hyper-specialised world from such a multi-dimensional worldview?
