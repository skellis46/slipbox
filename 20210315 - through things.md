# 20210315 - through things

I was walking through the commons and the trees, being with them. At "my" birthday tree, I imagined throwing the camera in and through the branches -- through things and around things. #ideatotrydone [[20210316 - settings and trees]] 

Spent time today working through the different settings in [[20210309 - playing and catching]]

1. TOP LEFT video: [[20210309 - playing and catching#^a058fe]] -- little blown out (this is about color:flat I think)
2. BOTTOM LEFT video: [[20210309 - playing and catching#^241c58]] -- this is definitely most 'natural' looking and the autoexposure seems to cope pretty well (and quickly). I suspect the exposure changes (automated) will be fine as the material will likely be played back so quickly? 
3. TOP RIGHT video: [[20210309 - playing and catching#^1c4a7e]] -- of fixed shutter options I shot (this one at 480 in sunny day) this was best. What I didn't try was color:GoPro with shutter:480; iso: 400 #ideatotrydone in [[20210316 - settings and trees]] 
4. BOTTOM RIGHT video: [[20210309 - playing and catching#^aaf938]] -- just too blown out (shutter at 240)

What I didn't do was try the following: #ideatotrydone [[20210316 - settings and trees]] 
RES: 1080
FPS: 120
FoV: N
WB: 5500K
color: flat
shutter: 240, 480
iso: 400
sharpness: low
EVC: -0.5

My sense is it's best to lock off the shutter speed (rather than have camera dealing with massive changes in lx conditions). Update to this in [[20210316 - settings and trees]] -- I was wrong. Need to work with shutter speed in auto.

5. CENTRE video: [[20210309 - playing and catching#^8e9d07]] -- pretty good but need to try with shutter speed at 120, 240 and 480. ALSO are there any problems with only getting 120FPS (not sure I can trade off the resolution though) #ideatotrydone [[20210316 - settings and trees]]

While I was working with setting comparison footage I uploaded the following just for fun:
