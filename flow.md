# flow

_previous note:_ 

> During a state of flow, individuals become absorbed in the activity they perform as it provides a challenge-skill balance which keeps the individual engaged, without falling into boredom or anxiousness. [@lynch-2021-role p.439]

> The nine dimensions of the flow state include challenge-skill balance, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, concentration, transformation of time, action-awareness merging, paradox of control, loss of self-consciousness, and autotelic experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 2014; Jackson & Marsh, 1996). [@lynch-2021-role p.1640]

- action-awareness merging refers to effortlessness
- see [[Julianna M. Lynch & Allison S. Troy - The Role of Nonduality in the Relationship Between Flow States and Well-Being]] for literature note

> When performing as a virtuoso, one is in what psychologists call a “flow” state.[2](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter6-2) In such a state, one experiences one’s action as spontaneous, not as planned or calculated; one’s own body, cognitive states, and the objects around one are not objects of reflective awareness, even though in these moments one is perhaps more closely perceptually attuned to the world and to one’s own actions than at any other time. There is, despite this exquisite attunement and control, no experience of subject-object duality, and no awareness of self. The achievement of real expertise, the *Zhuangzi* suggests through this parable, is in part the achievement of this kind of perceptual skill and perceptual-motor attunement. In the achievement of virtuosity, if this is right, we also see the *elimination* of one’s sense of self. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspvma8ehsb81dhmv6pnf69b))
