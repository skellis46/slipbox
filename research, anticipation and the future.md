# research, anticipation and the future

_previous note:_ [[connection between question, answer and method]]

>There is a particular future-orientated character to all ambitious research, which has the form of an anticipation: an anticipation that that which is not known may yet become known; that the as yet un-thought may become thought; and that new modes and styles of sense, perception, expression and subject construction might yet emerge and re-shape our worlds. Whether at the level of the first tentative framing of a research proposal or at the level of planning institutional and sectoral research agendas, activities rooted in enquiry necessarily require that we act in the present through an orientation towards near and not-so-near futures. Of course, the temporalities of research have many more folds, nuances and displacements than this simple orientation to a future. However, a speculative future horizon characterises research activity and operates either implicitly or explicitly.[@wilson-2013-share p.265]

_thoughts & links:_

- #finger-pointing-moon 
- I'm curious about research processes that break or contradict Wilson and van Ruiten's thinking. That is, it's very hard to disagree with. In a way they are talking directly to contribution: unthought becoming thought, not yet known becoming known. 
- [[two definitions of research in practice-research]]
- [[borgdorff - debate on research in the arts]]
- [[future responsibility and stewardship]] -- tenuous here, but intriguing in relation to "people we will never meet"
- [[conversation and understanding]] -- "we come to see it". Focus on re-orientation, perhaps even anticipation in how Wilson and van Ruiten describe it.
