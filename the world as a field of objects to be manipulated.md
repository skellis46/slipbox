# the world as a field of objects to be manipulated

_previous note:_ [[standard critique of technology]]

> I am generally convinced by those who, in trying to describe the modern mode of relating to the world, find that it is best characterized as a relation of mastery and control, which is to say a relation of power. Positioned in this way, we are tempted to see the world, including ourselves, as a field of objects to be endlessly manipulated, optimized, and exploited. The world appears to us chiefly as raw material for our own projects. It is there primarily to be used and transformed to serve our purposes.
