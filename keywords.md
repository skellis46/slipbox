_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

In their introduction to _Time: a vocabulary of the present_ the editors Burges and Elias worry that the words _past_, _present_ and _future_ seem too limited to express our complex experiences of temporality. They describe how these words are _keywords_ in the original sense of that word: "a word that acts as the key to a cipher or code"[@burges-2016-introduction p.1]. They think that the three words act as ciphers that "unlock the historicity of time."[p.1]

- This simple idea -- of a word as a cipher is fascinating.

_original source/found:_ I was aware of the book for some time (2016?) but in late February 2022 I was reminded of it through Shannon Mattern's work -- who cites Jimena Canales from this text
