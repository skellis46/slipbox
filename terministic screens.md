# terministic screens

_previous note:_ [[thinking is social]]

---

Jacobs cites an essay by "literary critic" Kenneth Burke called _Terministic Screens_.[^ts] Burke describes how whenever we use language (or _terms_) of any kind it acts as a kind of filter (or _screen_) enabling us to see or "call attention to" particular things, but not see other things. Terministic screens are unavoidable (we need terms to be able to say anything), but Jacobs writes: 

>we need to work hard to understand how our terms work, especially how they “direct the attention”: What does this language ask me to see? What does it prevent me from seeing? And—perhaps most important of all: Who benefits from my attention being directed this way rather than that?[@jacobs_how_2017 Chapter 4: The Money of Fools, n.p.]

Earlier in the same chapter, Jacobs cites from Thomas Hobbes' _Leviathan_: "For words are wise men’s counters—they do but reckon by them; but they are the money of fools." This idea of _counters_ is akin to a proxy: it is not the thing, but certainly bears some relationship to it:

>It is easy to become captive to words, to treat them as though they truly and fully convey genuine knowledge—as though they are real cash money, legal tender, accepted everywhere at their face value, rather than mere counters.[@jacobs_how_2017 Chapter 4: The Money of Fools, n.p.]

[^ts]: “Terministic Screens” is chapter 3 of part 1 of Kenneth Burke, Language as Symbolic Form (University of California Press, 1966).


_questions & thoughts:_

- the word _counters_ doesn't quite make sense to me (perhaps it's slightly archaic). That is, what _is_ a counter?

_consider:_

- #finger-pointing-moon - thinking here of drawing attention to the terministic screens of #practice-research. What are they? What functions do they provide? What do they prevent us from seeing or noticing?
- ties closely with my interest in #finger-pointing-moon of proxies and attempting to dive into what the _thing_ is rather than using something that stands in for it.
