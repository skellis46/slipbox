# evidence and protecting the dissenters

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

---

As part of his podcast and website called _The Knowledge Project_ Shane Parrish interviews the renowned psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman. They discuss many things, mostly to do with [[cognitive biases]], and at one stage Parrish asks Kahneman about ways to reliably bring to our attention evidence that is contrary to what we think or believe, and to make it difficult to ignore that evidence. Kahneman responds that if you are managing a team one of your key roles is to "protect the dissenters"[Kahneman, in @parrish_daniel_2020 34min 40sec], and that you ought to make it "painless to dissent".


_questions & thoughts:_

- I don't understand my fascination with [[cognitive biases]], but I think there's something about the paradox of being able to know something in theory, but it makes no difference to your capacity to know about it in practice  
- would be good to look at some of this original research? 
- how might this kind of protection happen within the individual? Is it at all possible? 
- these ideas map onto ongoing curiosity about truth, and tricks, and lies, and imagination
