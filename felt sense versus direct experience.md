# felt sense versus direct experience

_previous note:_ [[felt sense]]

gendlin and felt senses -- akin to direct experience (Harris)??

From Lola Maury's PhD: 

> Philosopher Eugene Gendlin coined the term _felt-sense_, to describe 'the body's sense of a particular situation' (1981, p. 10), the pre-verbal sense of things or the inner awareness of something that has not been consciously thought (several of the practitioners I mentioned in this thesis use the term 'felt-sense' in their practice; see for example Bacon and Midgelow  on p.66). Gendlin explains that 'a felt sense doesn't come to you in the form of thoughts or words or other separate units, but as a single (though often puzzling and very complex) bodily feeling' (1981, pp. 32--33). He defines the process of attending to the felt sense as an attempt to concentrate on the moment before one knows what they mean; a process of developing internal bodily awareness or bodily knowing (of a situation, person, event) to tackle with the blurry, the murky zone or the ambiguous territory under feeling (Gendlin, 2019). Throughout the research, as I studied my community of practice, I increasingly trusted the possibility to invite the audience to tune into the small and habitual, but also the fuzzy, the not clear, the non labelled. I now stand with assurance for sensing the opaque or the irrational in the banal as a valuable preparation tool for the spectator to embrace uncertainties of meaning during a performance.

But weird re blurry -- there's nothing blurry for me about the direct experiences (temp, movement, tingling, tension)

- [[losing one's self]] -- direct experience??
