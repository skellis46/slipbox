# self-conscious in the pejorative sense

_previous note:_ 

> In those special moments in which we need to become aware of our own subjectivity, doing so can facilitate our engagement with the world. But in most cases, that superimposition does not render us more effective or more aware of what transpires around us. Instead, it makes us less aware of our surroundings and of the objects or others to whom we should be attending; that is, it makes us self-conscious in the pejorative sense of that term. [@garfield-2022-losing n.pag.]

- this pejorative sense of the term is akin to the feeling of being seen by someone else: see [[flow and nonduality#^2141a6]]
