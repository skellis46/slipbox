# we hold them in our trust

_previous note:_ [[your body is an ancestor]]

> The creatures of this state do not belong to us. We hold them in our trust. The first people who lived here knew: all animals are our relatives. Our ancestors and our descendants are watching our stewardship. Let's make them proud. [@powers-2021-bewilderment p.56]
