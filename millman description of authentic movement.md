# millman description of authentic movement

_previous note:_ [[Millman - Towards a Neurocognitive Approach to Dance Movement Therapy]]

> Another technique often used within DMT is *Authentic Movement* (Whitehouse, [1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0119)), involving one individual as a ‘mover’ and another as an external ‘witness’, with the hypothesized mode of action being the release of unconscious feelings by the mover and becoming a witness of oneself. It is claimed that this can be achieved through attention to sensations, images and emotions, and then giving these a new form through movement, as well as through the development of a relationship between the mover and the witness. The witness encourages this inner listening and becoming of one's own witness under the assumption that ‘after being seen by another, one begins to see oneself’ (Musicant, [1994](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0082), p. 97).
