# meta-cognition and the limits of ballet

_previous note:_ [[van Vugt - Ballet as a Movement-Based Contemplative Practice Implications for Neuroscientific Studies]]

> Interestingly, while ballet dancers tend to use meta-cognition to ensure that they are still delivering the correct product (dance) to the audience, contemplatives use meta-cognition to primarily observe their own mental state. The meta-cognition that dancers use, in view of a project delivery is typically highly critical and judgmental, while yogis train to observe their mind and body with a non-judgmental attitude. It could even be said that an important function of meta-cognition in contemplation is monitoring whether or not one is reacting judgmentally. Consequently, comparing dancers and contemplatives on meta-cognition would be an interesting way to isolate externally-directed from internally-directed meta-cognition. Moreover, it will be interesting to see whether those two types of meta-cognition are associated with different neural correlates, along the lines of the suggested difference between meta-cognition of emotions and bodily state versus cognitive states (Fox and Christoff, 2014).[@vanvugt-2014-ballet] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyyk9tdh7wsa37ams1jw5316))

- fascinating but also so revealing regarding the limits of understanding about dancing and their focuses. Clearly the conditions of ballet training make judgement a near constant experience, and to even imply it is a contemplative practice is somewhat bizarre (although perhaps ballet dancers would disagree)
