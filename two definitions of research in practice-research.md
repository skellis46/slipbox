# two definitions of research in practice-research

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

I've previously published a simple effort (originally from 2013) to [define practice-research](https://practiceasresearchblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/05/a-definition/). At the heart of that definition is the back and forth between one's artistic practice and the work and ideas of a community of practice. 

In Henk Borgdorff's 2006 article on _The Debate on Research in the Arts_ he describes the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) (now Research Excellence Framework or REF) and Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) definitions of artistic research. 

The RAE version from the 2005 regulations is summarised by Borgdorff as:

>We can hence speak of research in the arts only when the practice of art delivers an intended, original contribution to what we know and understand.[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.9]

The AHRC definition from 2003 focuses on research questions, context, methods, documentation and dissemination, and Borgdorff notes that the criteria are different from the RAE criteria because the assessment occurs at different times -- RAE after the work is complete, and the AHRC before the research has begun.

What strikes me about the part of the RAE definition that Borgdorff quotes is just how well it _holds up_ 16 years later. It also does what Borgdorff was looking for -- to distinguish art practice-as-research from "art practice-in-itself".[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.10]

_thoughts & links:_

- be clear that this is not a definition of practice-research, but of the nature of research in practice-research
- [[knowledge verified and challenged]]
- I could split hairs over the "intended" part of the definition, and recognise the importance of serendipity in any research process, but perhaps the "intended" refers to a plan for something to happen as opposed to actually happens.
