# machines and creatures 

Dear

I read recently that memory is a liar; it’s “a heap of dog-eared, smudged, incessantly revised fictions”. So perhaps read on with this in mind.

At high school and university I studied a lot of maths and statistics, and I was a lot better at stats than I was at algebra. I don’t know why. In 1986, or perhaps it was 1985, our high school statistics class was told to collect car related data (colour, make, etc) over a 24 hour period from a large Wellington service station. The servo (slipping into speaking Australian briefly) was called “The Big E on the Quay” in case you were there. The idea was to generate a lot of real-world data that we could then use in our class. I have a vague memory of choosing one of the night slots with my friends. We waved our clipboards around, and perhaps got a little bored or sleepy. 

It’s hard to imagine such an unsupervised class excursion happening now but remembering it got me thinking.  

It got me thinking about what it must have taken at Wellington College high school for boys – or even in the development and history of human high school education – to justify such a venture. That counting things and statistics are so important that we’ll send out the entire class over a 24 hour period to tally up car stuff. That such an experience might even be fundamental to how they (the students) understand and participate in the world. Thinking back now I understand such justification to have been ideological. That is, we young boys-nearly-men were being trained to believe that the world and our place in it is built on numbers, on counting, and on numerical analysis.

In dance practice and scholarship we often remind ourselves and others of the aphorism that not everything that counts can be counted. Perhaps we use it as a rather flimsy shield against the enormous weight of datafied experience. 

L. Michael Sacasas is one of my favourite writers about technology and society, and if you are into that kind of thing I urge you to follow his substack over at https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com. In his post called [Embracing sub optimal relationships](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/embracing-sub-optimal-relationships), Sacasas writes:

> we are, to varying degrees, exhausted by the demands of a world ordered by the imperative to optimize for measurable outcomes, and in such a context we end up cutting out the things that don’t compute.

We cut out the things that don’t compute; the things that can’t be counted. 

It is my sneaky suspicion (or perhaps observation-without-a-clipboard) that a key aspect of human experience that does not reach the threshold of that which can be counted is the complex, messy and beautiful terrain of corporeal experience. The so-called felt sensations of being human bodies which weave together consciousness and emotions, our imaginations and memories, and even the sense of having a self. 

Given my background as a dancer-choreographer-academic, I am obviously biased towards such a perspective, even if it serves only as a futile and belated riposte to my indoctrination that night at The Big E on the Quay. But here’s Sara Briggs writing for Psyche:
 
> When it comes to decision-making and health, people differ in how much importance they place on bodily sensations – from hunger and fatigue to anger and joy. Some of us might dismiss or suppress sensations, talk ourselves out of a strong feeling (or let others talk us out of it), or simply place more importance on logic and rationality than on feeling.

The epistemic weight of that night of counting is difficult to underestimate. What would it take for a modern day high school to organise a 24 hour ‘data collection’ event in which 80 or so teenage boys were given the tools to observe or even just notice the nuanced and complex sensorial experiences of their bodies? What would have to change in our societal values to make such a thing happen without undue justification or red tape? Or even with due justification and red tape. 

In a footnote in Sacasas’s essay on sub-optimal relationships, he calls on Wendell Berry’s observation that we must decide if we want to live as creatures or machines. That night in 1986 (or maybe 1985) we boys were inadvertently being asked by the social order to be machines, even if we lived and breathed as beautiful young embodied creatures.
