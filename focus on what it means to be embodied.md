# focus on what it means to be embodied

_previous note:_ [[embodied intelligence project]]

> The theoretical stance of the practitioners demonstrates a striking parallel to positions presented by phenomenological philosophers who, in the tradition of French phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty [52], attempt to transcend viewing persons in dualistic terms and focus not on “the body” as such but on what it means to be ‘embodied’ [53,54]. “Embodiment is the human experience of simultaneously having and being a body; the term conceptualizes the body as a dynamic, organic site of meaningful experience rather than as a physical object distinct from the self or mind” [55]. [@mehling-2011-body p.10]

- Mehling et al. are referring to the focus groups of very experienced "mind-body" practitioners (yoga, tai-chi, Feldenkrais, Alexander Method, Body Awareness Therapy, etc)
