# zen and don't know mind

_previous note:_ [[direct experience through the senses]]

---

This is a blog post by G. Gordon Worley III in which he attempts to describe the Zen concept of beginner's mind -- or "don't know mind" -- in rationalist terms.

He describes two ways of looking at the concept of _don't know mind_:

1. In which the mind does not know, and is an invitation to learn more.

2. As a command: "do not know" (mind is ignored here because in Zen Buddhism mind is all you know and is redundant). Rather than a command to not know, it is an "an encouragement to gaze beyond form into emptiness".[@worley_iii_zen_2020 n.p.] 

Both ways suggest that as we come to name (or know) things, we are also open to all. That knowing is about making distinctions and therefore leaving something out. The beginner's mind -- "don't know mind" -- is therefore curious, willing and ready. It is open and accepting.
