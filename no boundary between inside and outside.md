# no boundary between inside and outside

_previous note:_ [[there is no boundary between awareness of experience and experience itself]]

> There are things that seem to indicate the world beyond your skin, sights and sounds. And there are the things that seem to attest to you being a separate entity in that world, sensations interior to the body and thoughts and feelings. Now pay closer attention and see if you can equalize these dimensions or recognize that there's no boundary between them. Because everything is just appearing in consciousness.

Waking Up meditation. Here's the full transcript:

> Just take your seat and let's begin with eyes open. And take a moment to reflect on how precious this time is. This might be the only period of the day or many days in succession where you take the time to merely pay attention without any other agenda. Even if you practice regularly, consider how rare this is in your life. And to mention how rare it is in the lives of most people. Each one of these sessions is a kind of island in time. See if you can fully occupy it. The rest of your day will come soon enough. And just take a few deep breaths. And become aware of the sensations of sitting, tingling, movement, pressure, temperature, whatever appears. And then notice sounds. And notice the open space of your visual field, color, and shadow. You might see the space in front of any objects. You might look like you can see the air in the room. And then notice the sound of the air in the room. So, keeping your gaze very wide, noticing sensations in the body and sounds and even thoughts and emotions. Just let everything appear and observe that by tendency these appearances seem to fall into two different categories. There are things that seem to indicate the world beyond your skin, sights and sounds. And there are the things that seem to attest to you being a separate entity in that world, sensations interior to the body and thoughts and feelings. Now pay closer attention and see if you can equalize these dimensions or recognize that there's no boundary between them. Because everything is just appearing in consciousness. The sights and sounds and sensations and thoughts have nowhere else to appear. This is a single condition. Just rest as that. And if you like you can close your eyes now. But notice once again that your visual field is entirely present. The gaze into that sky-like space.
