# disidentification

_previous note:_ [[feeling vs looking while moving]]

I first heard this term in [Diane Musho Hamilton's conversation with Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/waking-up-conversations/ethics-and-emptiness) although I didn't take note of where in the conversation she mentioned it. 

Here's a working definition from [Kenneth Sorenson](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/chapter-4-disidentification-the-way-to-freedom/):

> Disidentification creates a neutral distance in us from whatever we identify with. For Ken Wilber it is “converting hidden subjects to conscious objects”. [The observer](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/the-observer/ "Glossary: The observer") is not the observed, so whenever we disidentify from false self-images it help us to discover our real self – the observer. Identifying with certain psychological states, social roles and identities allows them to become a distal object or “me”. Disidentifying is to let go of the [attachment](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/attachment/ "Glossary: Attachment") to this “me” by observing it and integrating it in its proper way. It then becomes an object of consciousness. We then discover ourselves as the observer – a point of pure self-awareness and [will](https://kennethsorensen.dk/en/glossary/will/ "Glossary: Will").

There's something I don't quite understand in how it appears to reinforce the duality of 'observer' versus 'observed' (and the 'real self'). But it also seems to hint at the distinction Joseph Goldstein makes between [[feeling vs looking while moving]] -- that is, to shift from 'observing language' to simply feeling enters nothingness or pure consciousness (and relating to [[losing one's self]] during [[authentic movement]] or dance improvisation)

Perhaps I am drawn to how disidentification seems to hint at the actual experience while improvising: I see this hand, this arm, this leg but I do not identify with it. I experience this feeling, this memory, this imagined thing but I do not identify with it. They are not me as there is no me. 

Note how different disidentification is from dissociation.
