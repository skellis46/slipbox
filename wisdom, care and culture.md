# wisdom, care and culture

> Generative people care for others in a direct, forward-oriented relationship—mentor to mentee, teacher to student. They are caregivers. Guardians are care*takers*. They take responsibility for the cultural values and riches from which we all benefit, offering their concern beyond specific individuals to their culture as a whole; they engage a social radius that extends beyond their immediate personal surround. They are curators, looking to the past to preserve it for the future. [p.155] 

> The task of the Guardian is to honor the vast completing realities of past, present, and future, and to find, as the judge does in The Merchant of Venice, the true wisdom that is a fusion of caring and justice. [p.156]

> Once older adults can no longer procreate children, their task has been to preserve the culture, to become what anthropologists call 'firestick elders'.[p.159]

> At eighty-five [Boatwright] believed that his most creative activity was "to inspire people to see all sides of a problem"—a hallmark of wisdom.[p.168]

> Psychologist Laura Carstensen and her Stanford colleagues have documented that in late life emotions often take the place of thinking. As Boatwright explained it to Batalden, "With age, you acquire more understanding. The things you felt so passionate about when you are young, you learn to let go of. You realize that all those things you thought you were going to bee, you ain't. As I have often said, at this stage in life it's not what you've accomplished in a day, but how they day felt."[p.168]

Definitions of wisdom (by 75 year olds in the study):

> Empathy through which one must synthesize both care and justice.
> Tolerance and a capacity to appreciate paradox and irony even as one learns to manage uncertainty.
> A seamless integration of affect and cognition.
> Self-awareness combined with an absence of self-absorption.
> The capacity to 'hear' what others say.[p.186]
