# evidence understood rather than experienced

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> Climate, as the aggregate of numerous atmospheric and weather phenomena, is apprehended through data and scientific modelling, through systems and mediations that have to be processed cognitively and intellectually. These methods provide scientific evidence that according to Chaudhuri and Ennelow (2014: 24) are ‘understood’ rather than ‘experienced’. [@brown-2020-hau p.76]


_thoughts & links:_

- this is a fascinating question: what is the difference between understanding and experiencing? At first thought I imagine it's not possible to understand something without experiencing it but that would depend on what we understand an experience to be. Does this touch on [[direct experience through the senses]]?
