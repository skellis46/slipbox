# homophilic spaces 

_previous note:_ [[the opposite of paradox is polarization]]

> Indeed, the 21st centuryâ€™s proliferation of digital enclaves might be less attributable to new technological impositions than to how the weakening of such geographical, social and political constraints has freed each individual to construct a personal environment in ever more specific ways. As the journalist Bill Bishop argued in The Big Sort (2008), by charting the movement of US citizens into increasingly like-minded neighbourhoods over the past century, this homophilic drive has long directed our movements through physical space. In the online world, it now occurs through more than a million subreddits and innumerable Tumblr communities serving everyone from queer skateboarders to incels, flat-Earthers and furries.
