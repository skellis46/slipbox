# nonduality

_previous note:_ 

> The integration of self during flow activities parallels ideas found in the larger philosophical perspective of nonduality. Nonduality describes a unification between subject and object, such that boundaries between self and world dissolve. This perspective permeates many different religious, mystical, and philosophical traditions, and can be explicitly found in the Hindu schools of Advaita Ved훮nta and Kashmiri Shaivism, Mah훮y훮na Buddhism, and Tibetan Bon Dzogchen and implicitly present in Daoist traditions (Blackstone, 2015; Kr채geloh, 2018; Wright, 2017). [@lynch-2021-role pp.1640-1641]

Lynch and Troy's article is an excellent overview of nonduality research, including distinctions between _true_ or _pure_ NDA (p.1642) and other experiences of nonduality that still contain mental content. They also make clear that NDA is very different from being distracted (no surprises there).

Noting the Nondual Awareness Scale (NADA) by Hanley et al., 2018 [as cited by @lynch-2021-role]:

Also this big claim:

> The term nonduality encompasses a unified experience in which the boundaries between self and environment dissolve. This experience of nonduality seems to underlie the experience of flow. [@lynch-2021-role p.1649]
