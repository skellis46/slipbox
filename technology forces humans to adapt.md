# technology forces humans to adapt

_previous note:_ [[moral and ethical implications of our tools]]

L. Michael Sacasas writes and thinks about technology. His Substack is called The Convivial Society and I assume is named after the Austrian theologian and philosopher Ivan Illich's book  _Tools for Conviviality_.

In this post he cites Illich:

>Contemporary man attempts to create the world in his image, to build a totally man-made environment, and then discovers that he can do so only on the condition of constantly remaking himself to fit it.[Illich, in @sacasas-2021-humanbuilt n.pag.]

In other words, we adapt ourselves to fit the "techno-economic order that exists for its own sake and not for ours."[@sacasas-2021-humanbuilt n.pag.] 

> What Illich and Ellul would have us consider is that the human-built world is not, in fact, built for humans. And, of course, this is to say nothing of what the human-built world has meant for the non-human world. What’s more, it may be paradoxically the case that the human-built world will prove finally inhospitable to human beings precisely to the degree that it was built for humans without regard for humanity’s continuity with the other animals and the world we inhabit together.[@sacasas-2021-humanbuilt n.pag.]

The human built world is not built for humans.
