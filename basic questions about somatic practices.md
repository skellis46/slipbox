# basic questions about somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[history of somatics]]

--- 

1. What are the benefits of somatic practices? Is there any evidence for these benefits?
2. What are the skills that advanced somatic practitioners have that others do not? 
3. Is it possible to recognise an advanced somatic practitioner? What are we seeing or noticing? 
4. What are the capacities that we claim somatics have some effect on?
	- enhanced [[interoception science overview]]
5. What changes in the capacity to sense the body are able to be quantified (or even just described qualitatively)?
	+ Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Questionnaire. I first read of this in [[Ahmadi - Comparison of the effects of the Feldenkrais method]]. The test is here: <https://osher.ucsf.edu/research/maia>
	+ heartbeat perception task. First came across this in Christensen et al [@christensen-2018-can] - learned of that paper in Lynette Fisher undergrad publication re Gaga called "Listening to my body"
	+ proprioceptive awareness. First seen for me in Kiefer et al [@kiefer-2013-lowerlimb]. An enormous amount of literature on dancers and balance (not specifically somatic training)
6. is it plausible to imagine one somatic practice as being representative or paradigmatic of them all?
