# basic questions about somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[history of somatics]]

--- 

1. What are the benefits of somatic practices? Is there any evidence for these benefits?
2. What are the skills that advanced somatic practitioners have that others do not? 
3. Is it possible to recognise an advanced somatic practitioner? What are we seeing or noticing? 
4. What are the capacities that we claim somatics have some effect on?
	- enhanced [[interoception]]
5. What changes in the capacity to sense the body are able to be quantified (or even just described qualitatively)?
