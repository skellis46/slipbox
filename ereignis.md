# ereignis

_previous note:_ [[technics as a process of exteriorization]]

> Ereignis is translated often as "an event", but is better understood in terms of something "coming into view". It comes from the German prefix, er-, comparable to 're-' in English, and Auge, eye.[23][24] It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix er- also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and Parvis Emad renders the word as "enowning"; that in connection with things that arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. Hubert Dreyfus defined the term as "things coming into themselves by belonging together". -- wikipedia [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology)
