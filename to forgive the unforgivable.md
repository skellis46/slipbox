# to forgive the unforgivable

_previous note:_ [[thinking is social]]

The singer Nick Cave publishes responses to questions from his fans on a website called [The Red Hand Files](https://www.theredhandfiles.com) In November 2021 Cave received a message from someone called Thomas describing how he had "betrayed the very essence of his soul."[^soul]

Cave's response is remarkable. He describes forgiveness as "the supreme human capacity" that carries danger for humans:

> This act of radical forgiveness is exceedingly difficult because our instinct for justice and vengeance feels far more natural and human than to find it in ourselves to forgive, however, as is clear from your letter, this instinct turned inward can be absolutely disastrous.[@cave-2021-just n.pag.]

What Cave then suggests is that we must separate the act from the person who carried it out.
