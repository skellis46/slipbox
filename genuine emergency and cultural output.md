# genuine emergency and cultural output

_previous note:_ [[we are the weather]]

Paul Kingsnorth is a writer and also the creator of the [Dark Mountain Project](https://dark-mountain.net) with Dougald Hine. The project is this:

> we are walking away from the stories that our societies like to tell themselves, the stories that prevent us seeing clearly the extent of the ecological, social and cultural unravelling that is now underway.[^1]

In a page on Kingsnorth's website he tries to describe what the Dark Mountain Project is and how it came about. What follows are two quotes/extracts that took my imagination. What is perhaps most terrifying is that these were written in 2010 (not yesterday).

> Enivronmentalism should start – used to start – from a simple question: what’s best for the rich web of life on Earth? But almost unnoticed, that question has, subtly, gradually, been replaced by another: how can we maintain our lifestyles, and extend those same lifestyles to everyone else Earth, whilst doing as little damage to ‘the environment’ as possible?[@kingsnorth-2010-journey n.pag.]

> A society experiencing a genuine emergency, as we often claim to be, would surely see that reflected in its cultural output. Surely our novels, our films, our TV shows, our media, would show some acceptance of the fact that our assumptions were crumbling, that the world that is coming will not be the same as the world we are leaving behind. Surely an age of ecocide would spur responses? But I saw – I see – no significant responses in the cultural mainstream. The denial extends to every aspect of what we produce and how we live our lives.[@kingsnorth-2010-journey n.pag.]
