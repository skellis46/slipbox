# beyond the standard critique of technology

_previous note:_ [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]]

> The point of this essay was to say that (a) the SCT is absolutely correct and (b) there’s no point in continuing to restate the SCT, even if you shift the terms around a bit or employ alternate ones. (For instance, Paul Kingsnorth talks about “[the Machine](https://paulkingsnorth.substack.com/p/the-tale-of-the-machine)” — but it’s precisely the same set of concepts and critiques.) [@jacobs-2024-sct]

> Since I wrote that essay I have (mostly) refrained from saying “We should attend to things other than those Technopoly wants us to attend to” and instead have tried simply to *attend to other things*. In other words: I’ve given up on making arguments about where our attention should go – not primarily because such arguments are useless, though they may well be, but because I have made them already – and have instead pursued demonstration. *Hey, look at this fascinating thing I’ve been looking at*. That’s what I’ve been doing since 2021, and it’s what I plan to keep doing.[@jacobs-2024-sct]
