# a list of somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[history of somatics]]

- Feldenkrais Method (ATM, FI).  
	> the goal is to expand awareness through movement (not movement with/through awareness) and integrating function in the sense of “using the whole self” in it: all parts of the body-mind work together harmoniously and efficiently in performing the function.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.261]
- ideokinesis
- BMC
- Alexander Technique
- authentic movement
- Pilates (??)
- Mabel Todd's work
- Skinner Release Technique
- Trager [see in Eddy, -@eddy-2009-briefa]


Noting that in science I've seen these kinds of practices called:
1. _body awareness-enhancing therapies_ ([journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048230](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048230))
2. "mindful movement practices"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258]
3. "acceptance based approaches"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258]
4. body awareness[@mehling-2012-multidimensional p.1]
5. somatic awareness[@mehling-2012-multidimensional p.1]
6. interoceptive awareness[@mehling-2012-multidimensional p.1]
7. movement-based embodied contemplative practices; in [[Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices]]
