# a list of somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[history of somatics]]

> The particular types of somatic work may be referred to as a discipline, practice, technique, method, system or ‘process’, all meaning to define the application of movement awareness ‘exercises’ or ‘experiences’ derived from a certain educational lineage.[@mullan-2014-somatics p.254] 

Somatics is a "name and theoretical umbrella"[Johnson, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.254] to the different practices, systems, etc. 



- Feldenkrais Method (ATM, FI).  
	> the goal is to expand awareness through movement (not movement with/through awareness) and integrating function in the sense of “using the whole self” in it: all parts of the body-mind work together harmoniously and efficiently in performing the function.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.261]

Noting that in science I've seen these kinds of practices called:
1. _body awareness-enhancing therapies_ ([journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048230](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048230))
2. "mindful movement practices"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258]
3. "acceptance based approaches"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258]
4. body awareness[@mehling-2012-multidimensional p.1]
5. somatic awareness[@mehling-2012-multidimensional p.1]
6. interoceptive awareness[@mehling-2012-multidimensional p.1]
7. movement-based embodied contemplative practices; in [[Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices]]
8. mindfulness through movement (referring to Feldenkrais)[@mattes-2016-attentional p.269]
9. "Western body-mind disciplines" (Mullan, 2014) - from [@mattes-2016-attentional] - original reference Mangione (1993) - in Mullan.
