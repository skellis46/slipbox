# The principle of availability

Many artist-scholars develop research that is difficult to share or that resists documentation. The principles of futurity, strange tools and mess assist the artistic-scholar in finding themselves in such strong places. Yet the principle of availability states that making our work available to others is more important than artistic principles. 

Once again, there is productive tension here.
