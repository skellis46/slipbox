# the limits of movement-based

_previous note:_ [[the distinction between body–mind and mind–body experience]]

Context is discussion of MECP -- movement-based embodied contemplative practice.

> So what needs to move, and to what extent does the movement need to be overtly evident, in order for a practice to qualify as movement-based? Here we propose the idea of extending the concept of “movement-based” so as to include very subtle, and even imagined, movement. This idea is supported by our knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying motor control (Scott, 2012) and motor imagery (Schuster et al., 2011).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2]

- obvious connection with Paxton's small dance.

> At this point it might appear that every contemplative practice involves movement to some extent, and in fact we would argue that this is the case. Even in the most static forms of seated meditation the whole body is in constant subtle motion with the rhythm of the breath. That said however, we propose to define a movement-based practice as one in which the principal focus is on the intentional induction, or the intentional disinhibition, of overt movement or subtle internal sensations of movement. This definition excludes simply watching the breath while seated, unless specific emphasis is put on cultivating attention to the subtle movement that accompanies the breath.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.3]

- incredibly broad definition.
- [[movement is the principal function of the nervous system]]
- how does this sit with [[the distinction between body–mind and mind–body experience]] (Eddy's thinking)? Seems to be much more mind-body than body-mind. There's a question here for me about organisation or categorisation; I'm not quite sure how to use particular instances of body-based practices (listening to the body) to clarify (or interrupt) such broad categorisations.
