# social media are a trap

> But most people use social media not to unite, not to open their horizons wider, but on the contrary, to cut themselves a comfort zone where the only sounds they hear are the echoes of their own voice, where the only things they see are the reflections of their own face. Social media are very useful, they provide pleasure, but they are a trap.[Zygmunt Bauman, in @dequerol-2016-zygmunt n.pag.]
