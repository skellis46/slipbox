# Love after Love

The time will come   
when, with elation   
you will greet yourself arriving   
at your own door, in your own mirror   
and each will smile at the other's welcome,   
  
and say, sit here. Eat.   
You will love again the stranger who was your self.  
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart   
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you   
  
all your life, whom you ignored   
for another, who knows you by heart.   
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,   
  
the photographs, the desperate notes,   
peel your own image from the mirror.   
Sit. Feast on your life.

-- Derek Walcott
