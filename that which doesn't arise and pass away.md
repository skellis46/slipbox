# that which doesn't arise and pass away

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself - somatics chapter]]

The thing I am drawn to here (in particular) is this part: 

> There's no state that you can produce that matters. If it arises, it will pass away. The goal here is to recognize that which doesn't arise and pass away. The condition of empty, open, clarity that precedes and transcends every other experience. And as a matter of experience, you're not meditating on that. You are that. 

What I think might be a way of understanding the transition from dancing to being danced -- from driving to being driven -- is akin to passing from noticing to not noticing. One is being aware that there is an experience happening (which in itself is a deep immersed experience) to the other in which you become the experience. It's so subtle yet utterly obvious. It is from self-conscious to non-dual (in which one becomes conscious). The connections here with [[nonduality|nondual awareness]] and [[flow]] (and therefore [[flow and nonduality]]) are obvious.

Here's the entire meditation:

> Okay, just sit comfortably and close your eyes and let your mind rest wide open. There's nothing to create here, nothing to change, nothing to maintain. The purpose of this session is to just notice what is already the case. What is consciousness itself like? And if you notice any restlessness or fatigue, simply recognize those states as patterns of energy appearing in consciousness. This already transcends them. You can see the state of consciousness. It's not like that. Once again, you're not on the edge of experience looking in. There is only experience. There's no center to it or periphery. There's just this open and inexpressible condition and everything appears within it all by itself. If at any point when you're practicing, you begin to practice. You begin to feel especially calm, peaceful, even blissful. And you think, well, there it is. Meditations finally working. Notice that inclination to grasp. That is a transitory experience. And relinquish it. There's no state that you can produce that matters. If it arises, it will pass away. The goal here is to recognize that which doesn't arise and pass away. The condition of empty, open, clarity that precedes and transcends every other experience. And as a matter of experience, you're not meditating on that. You are that. It is the light by which everything else is being seen. In the last minute of the session, gaze into your visual field behind your closed eyes. Treat that like an open sky and just rest in the experience of seeing.
