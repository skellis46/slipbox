# there is no natural soma

_previous note:_ [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]

---

Isabella Ginot writes that the brain does not differentiate between instruments or a prosthesis (including even something as simple as a cane for a blind person) and the _organic body_:

>the "body" only understands itself in its capacity for action, and even more for interaction with the world, mediated or not by objects or machines.[@ginot_shustermans_2010 p.24]

In other words, [[action is the foundation of thought]].

Ginot suggests that somatic practices' belief in a _natural soma_ ignores challenging ideas about the body. That its belief in a natural body exists contrary to scientific discourse as well as the work of people like Haraway and Preciado. She writes that, "Somatics itself is a technique of fabricating the body, the result of which is the creation of a unique cyborg, with or without prosthetic devices."[@ginot_shustermans_2010 p.24] The end result for Ginot is that somatics uses scientific research only to protect its ideology, and not to question its assumptions or presuppositions.

_thoughts & links:_

- implications for practiced and ongoing use of camera when dancing
- compare with Borgmann's [[device paradigm and focal things]]. Seems as if it's possible to understand Ginot's critique of somatics in this current note as akin to a device paradigm (e.g. see [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]] in the way it delimits the field to the body). That the body (and its instruments) is already always profoundly enmeshed with focal things and activity. That [[focal activity is a convex lens]].
- my sense is much of the writing on device paradigm and focal things seems to _other_ technology in a way that Ginot does not.
- Ginot's disruption of -- or challenge to -- the _claimed clarity_ re the human body is vitally important. It undermines dance studies' focus on -- and valorisation of -- embodiment; and how I've suggested that [[the word embodied is a modifier]].
- see also Noë's description of the embodiment level (taken from roboticist Dana Ballard) in [[seeing as exchange with the world]]
