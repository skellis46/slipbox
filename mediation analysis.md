# mediation analysis

_previous note:_ [[Mehling - If It All Comes Down to Bodily Awareness]]

Mediation analysis is a statistical technique in which a third mechanism 'mediates' an independent and dependent variable. Rather than a causal relationship between an independent and dependent variables, a third mediating variable influences the IV which in turn influences the DV. 

Mediation analysis is an attempt to explore the underlying mechanism of how one variable influences another. Mehling writes that mediation analysis requires large sample sizes and expert knowledge of statistics.[@mehling-2020-if]
