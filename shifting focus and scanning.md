# shifting focus and scanning

_previous note:_ [[internal and external attention]]

---

Ahrens discusses the work of neurobiologist James Zull who understands that _to compare_ is a natural way of perceiving the world for humans. That when we pay attention to something we are not solely focused on that thing, but rather we are repeatedly shifting focus -- or "scanning the surroundings" in order to notice more detail: "The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans than when it focuses."[Zull 2002 p.142f, in @ahrens_how_2017 Chapter 12.5 n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- in [[moving camera bodies]] what kind of scanning is going on here?
- akin to the kinds of relaxed body scanning in somatic practices

--- 

_consider:_ 

- [[characteristics of somatics in HCI and interaction design]]
- [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]] -- when we notice something that is out of the ordinary or not the _norm_ how do we ensure that these observations are protected? 
- [[somatic feedback interrupts habits]]
