# we have forgotten how to breathe consciously

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> A total of 16 breaths a minute, 960 breaths an hour, 23,040 breaths a day; oxygen saturating your cells, breathing, our most immanent action, and yet, according to Luce Irigaray (2001), we have forgotten how to breathe consciously. Through our inter-arts and inter-cultural collaboration, we invite witnessing air, atmospheres, breaths and cosmologies in relation.[@brown-2020-hau p.69]


_thoughts & links:_

- need to go into Irigaray's thinking on breathing and the context in which she was describing this idea
- linking here to thinking on [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]] re re-membering. I don't seem to be able to shake this dichotomy between remembering and forgetting
