# the observed soma is changing

> But the soma that is being observed is not only aware of itself through self observation but it is also simultaneously in the process of modifying itself before the observer's eyes.[@hanna-1995-what p.344]

The sensing soma is adapting and changing as it is observed. Being observed changes the sensations. This links the body (as observed from the outside -- see [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]) -- and the soma as sensed or felt from the inside. It seems to undermine the idea that they are categorically distinct (as Hanna says). Or at least they influence each other while being in distinct categories.

_thoughts & links:_

- reminded of my interview with Amaara Raheem for Choreographic Practices. That simple instruction to imagine one is being watched. 
- [[the observer is the observed]]
