# confusing self-consciousness with consciousness

_previous note:_ [[self is a complex interplay of brain, body and environment]]

> Selfhood is probably the aspect of consciousness that we cling to most tightly, so tightly that it can be tempting to confuse self-consciousness (the experience of being a self) with consciousness itself (the presence of any kind of subjective experience, of any phenomenology, whatsoever). [@seth-2021-being LocationÂ 467]

This is included as a reminder of the trap. There is more on selfhood in Seth at [[Seth - Being You#^8313d4]]
