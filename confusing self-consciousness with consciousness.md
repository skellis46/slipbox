# confusing self-consciousness with consciousness

_previous note:_ [[self is a complex interplay of brain, body and environment]]

> Selfhood is probably the aspect of consciousness that we cling to most tightly, so tightly that it can be tempting to confuse self-consciousness (the experience of being a self) with consciousness itself (the presence of any kind of subjective experience, of any phenomenology, whatsoever). [@seth-2021-being Location 467]

This is included as a reminder of the trap. There is more on selfhood in Seth at [[Seth - Being You]] but fuller quote below: 

> Conscious level concerns ‘how conscious we are’ – on a scale from complete absence of any conscious experience at all, as in coma or brain death, all the way to vivid states of awareness that accompany normal waking life. Conscious content is about what we are conscious of – the sights, sounds, smells, emotions, moods, thoughts, and beliefs that make up our inner universe. Conscious contents are all varieties of perception – brain-based interpretations of sensory signals that collectively make up our conscious experiences. (Perception, as we will see, can be both conscious and unconscious.) Then there’s conscious self – the specific experience of being you, 31and the guiding theme of this book. The experience of ‘being a self’ is a subset of conscious contents, encompassing experiences of having a particular body, a first-person perspective, a set of unique memories, as well as experiences of moods, emotions, and ‘free will’. Selfhood is probably the aspect of consciousness that we cling to most tightly, so tightly that it can be tempting to confuse self-consciousness (the experience of being a self) with consciousness itself (the presence of any kind of subjective experience, of any phenomenology, whatsoever).

- [[losing oneself]]. this longer quote resonates so strongly with my experience of [[authentic movement]] in which the sense of self is profoundly backgrounded and the direct experiences (built on the anchor of bodily sensation) are phenomenologically foregrounded
