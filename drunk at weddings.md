And drunk-dancing at a wedding is unstable  
but the illogic of it is also encoded somewhere.

- Jonathan Burrows (2022), Writing Dance, p.14

Last month's essay was called [mountain climbing](https://mailchi.mp/fe6945a2613a/climbing-mountains), and in it I wrote about alpinist Marc-André Leclerc, my dead mountain-climbing friend Campbell Grierson, self-consciousness and dancing. I had some quite intriguing responses to the writing so I thought this month I'd break form and write a follow-up. 

In the essay, I was talking about dancing without being a self who is seen. One reader reminded me of just how similar that is to the hackneyed idea of dancing like nobody is watching. I was 24 years old in a bar in Queenstown in the south of New Zealand the first time I saw this pre-meme meme: 

You have to sing like you are standing on a table  
Dance like nobody is watching  
And love like you'll never get hurt. 

I imagine you are all familiar with some version of it, and I remember being quite taken by it, particularly the love bit. Now, 30 years later, I have some sense that the *love bit* is the only impossible part! But dancing like nobody is watching stuck with me so much that in 2011 I had stickers printed and put them up around the Department of Dance (like nobody is watching) at the University of Roehampton.

Years later, a colleague removed one as they thought it implied that dance was insignificant or had so little value that no one was watching. Instead, I like to imagine that part of dance's significance is that it offers a glimpse of being human without a self. But the conditions for such experiences are quite specific and they amount to moments in which one has permission to be seen without the feeling of being judged. I experienced it in spades working with the director-choreographer Bagryana Popov. She had (and I imagine still has) the capacity to build an environment of openness and trust. And I experience it when I practice the strangely named _authentic-movement_, regardless of who the person it is I am working with. Experiences of non-judgement in any field – akin to what the famous therapist Carl Rogers called unconditional positive regard – are strangely and sadly rare.

The friend of another reader – a climber – read the essay and remarked that mountain climbing and dancing have nothing in common. They wrote: "Solo climbing is nothing like dancing. It is unself-conscious (or maybe self-unconscious). It's not poetry, its abnegation." Apart from loving the word _self-unconscious_, what interests me about this response is how it reveals the way culture's bump into each other and the limits of our imaginations. I can certainly imagine that for someone who is not a dancer, it is very difficult to begin to believe that dancing can happen without self-consciousness. Likewise, as someone who has never climbed mountains, I cannot begin to understand the practice as a form of abnegation. What is being denied? The self itself? 

Perhaps this reader's response makes me feel misunderstood; perhaps the rather large chip on my shoulder about the value(ness) of dancing is because I tend to think that dance is seen as something frivolous, something we humans do when we are drunk at weddings.
