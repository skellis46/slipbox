# neurophenomenology

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

> At a methodological level, the neurophenomenological strategy is to make rigorous and extensive use of first-person data about subjective experience as a heuristic to describe and quantify the large-scale neurodynamics of consciousness (Lutz 2002). The paper focuses on neurophenomenology in relation to three challenging methodological issues about incorporating first-person data into cognitive neuroscience: (i) first-person reports can be biased or inaccurate; (ii) the process of generating first-person reports about an experience can modify that experience; and (iii) there is an ‘explanatory gap’ in our understanding of how to relate first-person, phenomenological data to third-person, biobehavioural data.

> Neurophenomenology uses phenomenological investigations of the phenomenal structure of subjective experience to guide neuroscientific investigations of the brain activity subserving consciousness (see, e.g., [Lutz et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib59), [Rainville and Price, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib69)).

> Another complimentary approach, called ‘neurophenomenology’ [16], is to obtain detailed, first-person reports about moment-to-moment subjective experience in order to uncover information about dynamic brain activities relevant to understanding conscious mental processes [18,19,20 ]. The working assumption of neurophenomenology is that first-person reports — especially from individuals either trained in the kind of metacognitive awareness cultivated in contemplative ‘mindfulness’ practices [50] (Lutz A, Jha AP, Dunne JD, Saron CD: Investigating the phenomenological and neurocognitive matrix of mindfulness-related practices, submitted for publication) or probed with refined methods for eliciting tacit experience [20 ,51 ] (or both) — can stand in a mutually constraining and illuminating relationship to cognitive-neuroscience evidence about the physiological processes sustaining moment-to-moment experience [16].
