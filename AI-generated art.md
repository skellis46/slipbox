# AI-generated art

There's been a lot of recent coverage of AI generated art in the last weeks. Here is some of that coverage that caught my eye.

Tech writer Ben Thompson has written a detailed overview of the changing nature of economics and work in [The AI unbundling](https://stratechery.com/2022/the-ai-unbundling/). He describes the _idea propagation value chain_ in which different technologies – in particular the printing press and the internet – change how communication is propagated along a chain made up of creation, substantiation, duplication, distribution and consumption. According to Thompson, human communication has evolved depending on the location of bottlenecks in this chain. For instance, the printing press removed the bottleneck of duplication and increased "the number of ideas that could be economically distributed." The last of Thompson's chain – creation and substantiation – is being removed or altered by AI-generated art.

Here's an AI generated image using the phrase 'ethical artificial intelligence in a human body' from [NightCafe](https://creator.nightcafe.studio/)

Mmmmm.

On Aeon.com two recent films have been shared. 

The first is a film called [Ghosts](https://aeon.co/videos/with-human-help-ais-are-generating-a-new-aesthetics-the-results-are-trippy) in which the film's "trippy shape-shifting visuals" were generated by a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) programme called StarGAN v2.

The second is a film called [Recoding Art](https://aeon.co/videos/what-does-an-ai-make-of-what-it-sees-in-a-contemporary-art-museum) that tries to make sense of what AI sees in a contemporary art museum.

And – slightly off-topic – here is an AI generated podcast in which [artificial Joe Rogan interviews artificial Steve Jobs](https://share.transistor.fm/s/22f16c7f).
