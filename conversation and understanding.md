# conversation and understanding

_previous note:_ [[gadamer and understanding as an event]]

---

Noë writes that in art and philosophy "there aren’t breakthroughs or discoveries or results or findings in these fields, certainly not ones that invalidate or cancel out earlier ones or preclude future ones."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] Rather, what we have is more about change, history and evolution; "moves in an important conversation"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] that keep that conversation alive and open. Art and philosophy do not produce "stand-alone nuggets of truth"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.] but are akin to a score which we enact as much as we perceive:

>We start out not seeing what is there. But by looking and interrogating and challenging, we come to see it. The work challenges us to reorganize our seeing, our expectations, and our thinking. The work of art, like that of philosophy, is the reorganization of ourselves. And this reorganization, this work, aims also at understanding.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 11, n.p.]

Noë is stating that the value and function of art is not about discovery, but in understanding. We are changed by it.

_questions & thoughts:_

- this note is taken from materials in Chapter 11:  _Art Is a Philosophical Practice and Philosophy an Aesthetic One_.
- who ought to be responsible for these enactments, or conversations? the artist reflecting as in PaR? Or the audience? or both? #practice-research
- how then -- and this is not the first time this question has been asked? -- is practice-research different from making art? See Magee ([magee-2012-accountability.pdf](hook://file/mz8Ki68gv?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=magee-2012-accountability.pdf)) for overview of how art made sense of itself in the academy at the beginning. See also Frayling (1993)
- the idea that art (and philosophy) produce change in understanding chimes very well with _Finger Pointing Moon_. The question becomes then who is changed by it -- and sets up the possibility of [[a case for writing in practice-research]] in which the artist-researcher sometimes does that work of change, other times allows it to rest with the audience/viewer. In this respect it's not so much the presence of writing that confers the status of 'research' on a work of art, but rather that the researcher has done the work of communicating change/understanding (which will necessarily not be equivalent to the understandings afforded by the artistic artefact)
- reminded here of how useful 'meaning potentials' and 'affordance' is in this case. That something is afforded by practice-research
 ^d47823
- [ ] look more into underpinnings of affordances? (Gibson)

_consider:_

- [[human experience and language]]
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[seeing as exchange with the world]]
