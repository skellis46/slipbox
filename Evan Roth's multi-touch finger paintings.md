# Evan Roth's multi-touch finger paintings

Bridle discusses a form of architecture called [[parametricism]] in which complex analogue forms are developed from digital tools. He memorably describes such architecture as "eruptions of the digital into the physical world"[@bridle-2011-new n.pag.]. But there's something different going on here. There's no eruption. It's much more like an ice-berg. That something is being done to these two people in [[Lithium Dancing]] beneath the surface of their awareness. The screen is above the waterâ€”we can see its beauty, the way it reflects the sun. But below the surface, the digital is reaching up and enframing how they move and for how long. 

Evan Roth's multi-touch finger paintings are useful here. They depict our gestures with phones, with names like _Slide to Unlock_, _User Name and Password_ and _Angry Birds, Level I-1_.[@roth-2012-multitouch] They are simple, and beautiful, and smudgy, not unlike smartphone screens themselves. Reflections tainted by the greasy smudges of our fingers. James Bridle describes Roth's images as "gestures mediated by the machine"[@bridle-2011-new n.pag.] They are images unimaginable before 2007 when the iPhone was launched upon us, yet they are also familiar because of our relationship to thumbprints, and to fingerprint technologies. I am reminded of my pre-teen years and my fascination with how finger prints were (and are) a method to deduce who did what. Roth's paintings are made possible by the machine, and the machine (and more accurately the software) has shaped these gestures. But Roth's awareness is critical. How he draws attention to the gestures as manipulated/mediated by the software-hardware interface. 

In the case of Roth (artist), it would be as if the software's role was to capture the slides and touches of the gesture in his work and then upload them to (most likely) massive Amazon Web Services servers. This is a very very different thing. Much more subtle. Much less direct. But not at all subtle, and utterly direct. Because of course I have no doubt that our screen-based gestures are being uploaded.
