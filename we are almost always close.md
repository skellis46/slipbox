# we are almost always close

_previous note:_ [[a border is not a boundary]]

> [Close] is what we almost always are: close to happiness, close to another, close to leaving, close to tears, close to God, close to losing faith, close to being done, close to saying something or close to success, and even, with the greatest sense of satisfaction, close to giving the whole thing up.
> Our human essence lies not in arrival, but in being almost there: we are creatures who are on the way, our journey a series of impending anticipated arrivals. We live by unconsciously measuring the inverse distances of our proximity: an intimacy calibrated by the vulnerability we feel in giving up our sense of separation.[@whyte-2019-consolations n.pag.]

- also made me think about [[entrainment]] which so strongly connects us (even without our wanting it)
