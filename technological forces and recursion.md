# technological forces and recursion

> And fourth, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces – that is to say, technologically.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

This last idea is very powerful. It seems to suggest the technological forces determine how it is that other things are seen (including things that we describe technologically). It's a loop. Recursion. and that their dancing in that park with that phone is a form of recursion. We can only understand this event in this way because it has "come to light" technologically. But I want to try and understand it beyond that recursion.

- one is the economics (above section), but here is a way out of the loop ...?

> Take recursion. It means, most simply, that you define a thing in terms of itself. But again and again, I watched people sit down at a computer, create a program that could go on forever, and quite simply freak out. Meeting recursion was like looking at objects of infinite regress, contemplating horizons, trying to find the end of the stars, all of these experiences that frighten and fascinate children—and adults.[@turkle-2021-empathy Chapter 16: Building 20, n.pag.]

> The basic phenomenon that belongs together with being is truth, or "revealing," which is the phenomenon Heidegger brings forward in his discussion in "The Question Concerning Technology." Things can show or reveal themselves to us in different ways, and it is attention to this that will help us recognize that technology is itself one of these ways, but only one. Other kinds of revealing, and attention to the realm of truth and being as such, will allow us to "experience the technological within its own bounds."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.69]
