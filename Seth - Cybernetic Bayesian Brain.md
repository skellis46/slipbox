# Seth - Cybernetic Bayesian Brain

_previous note:_ [[the self is a controlled hallucination]]

_chatGPT summary:_

> The research article explores the concept of "predictive processing," a theory suggesting that the brain functions as a prediction machine. It constantly makes and updates predictions about sensory inputs, aiming to minimize prediction errors and informational "free energy." This theory applies not only to external sensory perception but also to internal physiological states (interoceptive inference) and the understanding of the self. The paper discusses the integration of predictive processing with cybernetic principles emphasizing homeostasis and predictive control. Key points include the view of emotion as active interoceptive inference, the role of the body in structuring sensorimotor interactions, and the importance of counterfactual predictions in testing perceptual hypotheses. The research also links predictive processing with enactive cognitive science, suggesting that perception is not just about constructing internal models of the world but is fundamentally about maintaining homeostasis and organism survival.
