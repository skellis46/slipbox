# understanding is liberation from the old

_previous note:_ [[art as source of knowledge]]

Maria Popova hosts the blog [the marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org), and her posts tend to describe diverse philosophical ideas from mostly well-known writers. In [Love Is the Last Word: Aldous Huxley on Knowledge vs. Understanding and the Antidote to Our Existential Helplessness](https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/05/11/alxous-huxley-knowledge-understanding/) Popova quotes Huxley's thinking about the difference between knowledge and understanding:

> Knowledge is acquired when we succeed in fitting a new experience into the system of concepts based upon our old experiences. Understanding comes when we liberate ourselves from the old and so make possible a direct, unmediated contact with the new, the mystery, moment by moment, of our existence.[Huxley in @popova-2021-love n.pag]

This quote is from Huxley's _The Divine Within: Selected Writings on Enlightenment_. 

What is opens up is the possibility that for me to talk of understanding -- instead of knowledge -- is somewhat naive. That understanding is more akin to [[direct experience through the senses]] and knowledge is much more like [[concepts are abstract ideas]].

It's an extraordinary blog post and I've done it no justice here at all.
