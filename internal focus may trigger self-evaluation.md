# internal focus may trigger self-evaluation

_previous note:_ [[internal and external attention]]

The constrained action hypothesis [McNevin et al, in @mattes-2016-attentional p.260] proposes that an internal focus of attention interferes with automatic movement control processes that would normally regulate and organise movements "effectively and efficiently." [p.260] An external focus of attention allows motor processes to self-organise organically. See also [[Mattes - Attentional Focus in Motor Learning#^6a881c]]

Mattes discusses the work of Wulf and Lewthwaite (2010) who suggested:

> an explanation of the constrained action hypothesis based on "self-invoking triggers," conjecturing that internal focus instructions (those which "involve the human body") provoke access to the self and thereby may trigger self-evaluation and active self-regulation, leading to "a series of ongoing 'microchoking' episodes with attempts to right thoughts and bring emotions under control." Negative thoughts and emotions are in turn known to "influence or correlate with the neuromuscular coordination or control of movement tasks and skills" so that (negative) self-evaluation may lead to less automatic, more conscious and inefficient use of the body. McKay, Wulf, Lewthwaite, and Nordin (2015) provide empirical evidence consistent with the self-invoking trigger hypothesis.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.265]

This is effectively the opposite of how somatic practices like AM, FM, AT propose (particularly AM) to practice minimising self-evaluation (as in [[unconditional positive regard]]):

> In this context, self-evaluation and active self-regulation are precisely what the Feldenkrais work carefully aims to avoid.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.266]

- Mattes also mentioned [[negativity bias]] based on the work of Rozin, P., & Royzman, E. B. (2001). Negativity bias, negativity dominance, and contagion. _Personality and Social Psychology Review_, 5, 296–320.
- obliquely reminded of Nadal's coaching towards feel as opposed to outcome (which is how I remembered (rather poorly!) the following quote:)

> Boys whom [Toni Nadal] taught alongside his nephew recall that
 whereas other coaches highlighted the need to control the ball, Toni’s emphasis was always on the aggressive cultivation of winners. Toni himself cites the example of the golfer Jack Nicklaus saying once in a coaching video that his advice to young players was “First, hit the ball far; then we’ll think about getting it in the hole.” Toni took the lesson to heart. His advice to his nephew, right from the start, when he was four years old, was “First, hit the ball hard; then we’ll see about keeping it in.”[@nadal-2011-rafa n.pag.]
