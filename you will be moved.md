# you will be moved

[[a case for writing in practice-research]]

Dear 

One of the great pleasures of my working life is supporting PhD students to develop their thinking, practices and research. They are all remarkable people: curious, committed and capable. They are all also remarkably different with very different interests and ways of expressing those interests. Inevitably I get to see them at their best and occasionally at their worst because doing a PhD is not so easy. It involves a lot of solitary time reading and writing, and in that solitude there is plenty of time for doubt and uncertainty to grow.  

One of the doctoral students I am working with is Lola Maury who is researching the ways in which audiences are tuned to performance _before_ they enter the performance space. It is delicate and thoughtful work that Lola is doing and as I was reading the very first draft of her entire thesis (just yesterday) I was reminded of a work I made called [_Inert_](https://www.skellis.net/inert) that premiered in Melbourne in 2006. 

_Inert_ was created with Shannon Bott, David Corbet, Cormac Lally and Scott Mitchell and I seem to remember we were a pretty good team. As an aside, the night before the premiere (or perhaps it was the night before the night before) at [Dancehouse](https://www.dancehouse.com.au/), Scott (who was responsible more or less for the design of the work) had pulled an all-nighter making these plush body-length cushions that the two audience members would lean against. One was yellow and the other was red and when we saw them in the performance space for the first time our initial thought was that they looked like they were built for the set of a McDonalds commercial _if_ that commercial had involved coffins with plush lining. We'd spent years (or "literally years" as the kids say these days) planning this design and Scott simply said, "That won't do." The theatre maker Peter Brook said (of ideas), "Hold on tightly, let go lightly" and in that moment Scott embodied Brook's idea beautifully. 

The thing about _Inert_ that was unusual was that each audience member was placed on a kind of platform that half way through the short performance was manually tilted from near vertical to near horizontal. It was the key moment in the work because it is such a strong corporeal experience to be tilted backwards in that way. You feel gravity shifting in your body. Think being in a dentist's chair and yet we didn't want people to think they were in a dentist's chair.

To make the job of manually tilting the platforms easier we needed to know how tall each audience member was so that we could adjust the height of the footrest in order for their centre of gravity to be more or less at the axis of the platform. If we got that information wrong it was incredibly difficult to move people. But how do you ask people how tall they are when they book to see the work without it being super weird? To make things worse, I seem to remember that Dancehouse also wanted people to be somehow warned that they'd be physically moved during the show. Or perhaps that was some kind of health and safety regulation.

Regarding people's height we simply asked them directly. Something like, "For this performance we need to know how tall you are." But for the _warning_ about being moved we asked the following: "As part of this performance you will be moved, is that OK?"

I think now that I thought I was being quite clever -- to play with the language of being moved. Certainly it was meant to be playful while sidestepping the idea of a warning. I'm less sure now. I like the ways in which something might be unsure or mysterious; that not everything needs to be laid out. But I also think that had we been direct it would not have diminished the centrality of that moment of tilting movement half way through the performance. 

The philosopher Alva NoÃ« has written of how understanding _why_ a joke is funny is not in competition with getting the joke and laughing. In this case with _Inert_, more than 17 years after its premiere, I think we could have just said, "In this performance you'll be on a platform that will move from vertical to horizontal, is that OK?" and it would not have altered the weight of that corporeal experience or the 'fact' of that moment. 

But I could be wrong about that.
