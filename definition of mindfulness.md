# definition of mindfulness

_previous note:_ [[paying attention]]

> the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment. [Kabat-Zinn, 2003 in @mattes-2016-attentional p.269]

In _Mindful Movement_ Eddy simply writes that mindfulness is equivalent to "nonjudgmental self-awareness."[@eddy-2017-mindful p.5] Eddy's perspective on mindfulness is that it emerges from the body itself, as soma.  ^ec4a6e
