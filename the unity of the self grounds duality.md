# the unity of the self grounds duality

_previous note:_ [[Garfield - Losing Ourselves]]

- [[losing oneself]]
- [[the body is a different object]]
- [[an object of special regard]]

> This unity of the self, however, also grounds a duality: the duality of subject and object. We experience ourselves as subjects and everything else as objects, with a kind of distance between us and the world we experience. This duality so structures our naïve experience that it is hard to imagine that it is constructed, as opposed to natural. We take ourselves to be to the unseen seer, the reality known immediately in experience, the interior in which the external world is replicated and revealed in perception and in thought.

> When we experience external objects, we naturally take ourselves to perceive them just as they are, our experience functioning as an accurate representation of just what things look, sound, smell, taste, and feel like (unless we suspect sensory distortion for some reason). That is, we either take ourselves to be in direct, unmediated contact with the world as it is, or we take that world to be faithfully reproduced inside our consciousness, in a model that Dennett has aptly called “The Cartesian Theatre.”[14](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-14) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpm75rfs3y4mvzjzyexxtzw))


> the world we experience is not dually related to us, external to us, and independent, but one that we construct in our ongoing engagement with our environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmcsr908m8n0wkfthhnt6y))


> Each of these worlds is a construction, not a replication of a preexisting reality. None of these worlds has greater claim to reality than any other. So, the world we inhabit—just like the worlds of dogs, birds, and bees—is not a world we *encounter*, but a world in which we participate and which we *co-construct*.[16](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-16) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmdnmtvd95a7xyb949xacq))


> So, our awareness of the objects we encounter—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something other, dually related to ourselves—is in fact our nondual embeddedness in a world of which we are a part.

> In the same sense, our awareness of our subjective states—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something immediately present, dually related to that which is other—is in fact just another aspect of our nondual embeddedness in that world. We participate in the construction of what we regard as external to us, and what is external to us participates in the construction of what we experience as the inner. In sum, the very dichotomy of self and other, inner and outer, is a construction, not a given. Much of our life is structured by the illusion that we just find what we in fact construct; but the fact that this illusion structures so much of our experience does not mean that it is not an illusion.
