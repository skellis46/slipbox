# this body 

Chairs getting bigger in order for us to do less. (noticing software developers and gamers sitting in these massive chairs.)
History of chairs. 

The first time I had a body.

## The performing body
public speaking. Fear. Physiology. Apple Watch alarm for some heart problem.

## The impermanent body 

>Getting beyond dualistic thinking is not an easy task.  We might reflect, for example, on the oppositional symmetries of our very bodies (left/right, two eyes, two ears, two arms, two legs) and in the simplicity of prominent moral frames (good/bad, right/wrong, heaven/hell). Yet it is neither the only nor the best frame to deepen and enhance understanding of our world, our history, and possible solutions to the problems we face.
