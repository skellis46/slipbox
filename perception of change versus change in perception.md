# perception of change versus change in perception

_previous note:_ [[measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices]]

In this body-focused work (and also in mindfulness training) do we get more sensitive to sensation, or are the sensations changing themselves? This idea is discussed similarly here in which the perception of change is different from change in perception 2:40:40 - Harris / Seth <https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/113-consciousness-and-the-self> 

- what does it mean to be good at somatics? How do we recognise someone who is 'good' at somatics? It's a funny/silly/old question/joke about somatics, but so much of what we can't and can say about somatics rests on the capacity to understand and communicate what it is we are observing/noticing (in ourselves and in others) when doing somatics well. See in [[Zoran Josipovic - Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain#^448a09]] and also note the Varela reference in that blockquote.
