  > Since the birth of Dark Mountain in 2010, contributors, and especially artists, have broken out of the studio confines to become the work themselves, using their bodies as an intervention against the ‘trance-state’ of civilisation. In times of abstraction and disconnection, as our attention is pulled away from the realities we inhabit and towards ethereal spaces untethered to geography, remembering our earthly bodies is a way to reconnect with the physicality of the living world. 

> We’d like to see thoughts that move our ideas of bodies into uncharted territory: how they cope with heat, cold, humidity and change. In what ways are bodies ecosystems, microclimates, engines and dynamos, compost? Can acknowledgement of the cycles of life create an acceptance of rot and death, leading to a stronger connection with the physical world?

## Seeping into the land

Now the rain is pelting down. I am standing with my arms outwards, head tilted up towards the skies, blinded by the water as it plummets through this body and into the body of sand beneath my feet. Saturated. And cold to the bone in a UK summer.

Perhaps an hour earlier when the rain had already begun its raining, there is a large man lying shirtless on the side of the road. His car has drifted gently into a small wall and two women are applying cardiac compressions to his cyanotic body. Their physical effort is unsurprising and shocking. The man is a creature crossing over into death; his torso more a carcass being coaxed and willed to survive by knowing and desperately helpless hands.

---

In the rain on the sand, a simple practice begins. It is a practice that dissolves in and through the body; a soluble [[body being known]]. It is also a counter-practice, a corporeal balm that resists the machinations of the default digital logic. In this practice we live as creatures not machines. 

The artist is Helen Poynor. She is a dancer, a choreographer, a conjurer. She is the real deal. She says "I feel most fully myself when alone in the environment -- rather than it being an experience of standing against the world -- I feel then also embedded in it. Also, the site itself is dancing". We dancers are given scores to follow that involve being on site in different environments for an uncertain amount of time. There is the Iron Age hill fort called Blackbury Camp, or the tidal area under the cliffs down from Beer Beach where the cormorants nest along those same cliffs. Poynor's instructions include things like “stay at animal height” or “sprawl with part of your body contacting a rock and another part the pebbles” or “move, then rest in presence, then move”. The scores are a guide, and their simplicity belies the transformative complexity of being on and in and with these sites while weathering the weather. 

With scores as scaffolding we enter what initially seem like private zones within the public sites. The practice makes enormous sense at the scale of the human animal. This ever changing body starts to slow down as time yields to deep presence. There is nothing to do, nothing to know, nothing to want. I become a type of non-activity, and gradually there is no longer any sense of being outside of this activity and this site. As my senses are filled with the site, my desires, my hopes, my needs fall away. I feel deeply of the land. Whoever that "I" is. 

This is what the practice feels like. 

I have practiced dancing for nearly 40 years. This body-of-mine is steeped in somatic actions, feelings and languages as a means to filter and understand the sensorium. 

A somatic practice is any body-based practice that foregrounds the body as it is felt from the inside. This is the body as soma. Nearly all dance practices do this, but some more than others. Classical ballet, for instance, has a well-known obsession for how the body is seen from the outside. The presence of mirrors in ballet studios is a dead giveaway. But for those of us immersed in sensing the body as it feels from the inside, it's easy to forget just how radical is such a proposition. 

Somatic training foregrounds and sensitises the corporeal far beyond the way we humans usually think of our bodies only when something is wrong with it or it needs something, or when we are having sex. The body as soma can be rendered as feeling language: The feeling of dryness. The feeling of cold. The feeling of stillness. The feeling of wet. The feeling of weight. The feeling of earth. But the language of feeling can be distilled further. In the practice, and as a matter of direct experience, there is really only pressure, tension, temperature and movement. This is what all that training makes possible. It makes possible _awareness-ing_: pressure, tension, temperature and movement. These are pure experiences -- sensations of the body dancing with perceptions of the world -- that need not be named to be understood. It is not 'my hand' that feels cold. A hand is merely an English word that proxies as an abstract shorthand for a part of the body. Without such a construction or naming, without such an object as described by a subject, the direct experience is simply cold-as-awareness.  

The land also experiences pressure, tension, temperature and movement. I-as-body am seeping into the land.

The English philosopher Rupert Spira describes how human experience is formulated as I and other (e.g. "I don't like them") or me and the world (e.g. "I cut down the tree"). This is a subject experiencing, judging and manipulating objects that, crucially, conditions the way the world appears. Such a subject-object rendering of the world includes the body as a special kind of object. When we say, "My hand is cold", or even "I _have_ a body", who is the "I" that possesses such a body or feels its hand to be cold, and where is that "I" located? 

In the time of Poynor's practice, it is as if my sense of subjecthood – of being an “I” outside or separate to the environment – starts to resolve itself as being merely imagined. The feeling in those direct and extended experiences of being with dirt and rock and ocean and tree is of widening time and consciousness underpinned by profound humility. There is awe here in the diminishing scale and imagined palpability of the self: it is discombobulating beauty. The site-as-object softens and as a matter of direct experience the “I” becomes site. It is the difference between me dancing the site, and the site being danced. 

It is land being seeped into.

There is nothing for this practice to be reduced to. It has no clear constituent parts. It has merely been gently set in motion and in the end any sense of agency, of power, of control, slips away. The I-as-subject is fatally diminished, and even the capacity to distinguish is similarly diminished. There is no distinction left to be made between the weather, the site, and this skin covered collection of bones. Nor between I and them, me and the world. Without such small and grand distinctions, heaven and earth are inseparable.

When we become the sensation, or surrender to it, we disappear. This is a different kind of selflessness. It is a return to the absence of self that sharpens experience. It is the estranged and other twin to self-consciousness. In this practice there is no self standing against the world. The deep porosity and solubility of the body render it as an amorphous collection of tangible and unmediated experiences. If there is no self standing against the planet, then the self seeps into the cosmos and what remains is a body without boundaries.

That man on the side of the road died. He died in the rain while two people sweated and pushed the weight of their bodies through their arms and onto his chest. The next day there were flowers to mark the site. In his last unremarkable and unforgettable moments he whispered and shivered a reminder that our bodies are danced by the world.


## edit bin
I smile gently and inwardly at the "I" that wants something useful from the practice. 

in which the distinction between self and other departs

The body-oriented practice matters not because of what it might do _for_ me (or whomever is engaged in it) but that it undermines the conditioning of subject-object _me-ness_ -- of making distinctions

In the practice shared by Helen Poynor we dancers appear to start separate from the world. We enter the site. We choose a part of the site. We settle into the site. It is a pragmatic approach. But we cannot continue to be distinctive; we cannot continue to make a distinction between ourselves and the site. And nor were we ever distinctive. Such duality reveals itself only in situations in which our immersion and action in the world has somehow collapsed or broken down. And this is not one of those situations. This work is a regular situation, a normal situation. It's certainly not extraordinary. 

- what _causes_ this experience? Or rather, what makes it possible to return to pure subject-less awareness? Could I name some? Not wanting; not judging; attention to direct experience; not goal-oriented; not therapeutic (which is a goal), not differentiating ... 
- what are implications of this? 



"Otherwise put: humans do not possess agency; nor, for that matter, do non-humans. They are rather possessed by action. Karen Barad admits as much when she argues that agency ‘is an enactment, not something that someone or something has’ (Barad 2003: 826" (Tim Ingold, Making)

- to undo the conditioning. 


 

"As one Zen master said, The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.8" (Diane Musho Hamilton, Compassionate Conversations How to Speak and Listen From the Heart)

"The structure of subject-object duality emerges, on Heidegger’s account, only in these situations where fluid, immersed, embedded, embodied perception and action in the world breaks down. That duality is not a pervasive aspect of our conscious lives, but a specific response to an abnormal situation." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)
-- the work with Helen is a normal situation. It's certainly not extraordinary. 

> It is an expression of Truth, but it is not true. The sensation or cluster of sensations that are referred to as ‘the body’ seldom appears without some perception of the world also. This conglomerate of sensations and perceptions is one seamless experience. However, Consciousness arbitrarily divides this seamless experience of sensations/perceptions into two, into sensation and perception. It does this by identifying itself exclusively with the sensations, with the body, and by disidentifying itself from the perceptions, from the world. It thinks, “I am this cluster of sensations, the body, but not that group of perceptions, the world.” Therefore, it is not so much the ‘I-am-the-body’ idea but rather the ‘I-am-only-the-body’ idea that is problematic. (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

"What is our actual experience of the boundary between what is ‘inside’ myself and what is ‘outside’ myself? There is no experience of such a boundary!" (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

"From an early age we are encouraged to formulate our experience in ways that seem to express and validate it, and these expressions subsequently condition the way the world appears. ‘David loves Jane,’ ‘Tim saw the bus.’ Our earliest formulations divide experience into ‘I’ and ‘other,’ ‘me’ and ‘the world,’ a subject experiencing an object. From that time on, our experience seems to validate these formulations. However, at a certain stage it begins to dawn on us that these formulations do not express our experience, but rather they condition it." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

A way to become aware of complex corporeality and complex things as 

> There's only one thing that's necessary in practice, only one thing, and that is the open experience of what is – usually the body – without anything else interfering. To be able to sit and just be nothing but that sensation. See, that sounds simple. It's not so simple because human beings don't want to do it. There's no you in that experiencing. If there's a shadow of a self ... identification type thought, then nothing happens. [@jokobeck-2023-practice n.pag.]

> I want to say again what it is when people say, 'Oh yeah, I'm experiencing my body'. I doubt it. As human beings, we don't want to stay with this at all. The minute you become the sensation, totally surrender to it, you've disappeared. And the whole focus our life isn't to disappear, but to glorify ourselves, to increase my sense that I'm important, I'm wonderful. [@jokobeck-2023-practice n.pag.]

is irreducible (after Latour) [[Muecke - The Generous Philosopher]]. And because it has no clear constituent parts on which the experience might be predicated, nor is it emergent. [[emergence]]? It has merely been gently set in motion and in the end -- as a matter of direct experience -- 

- [[pure experience is the same as direct experience]]
Any sense of agency, of power, slips away. 

 something here about these are the experiences of all subjects? (or entities?) Pressure, tension, temperature and movement appear in awareness, yet awareness has no location. It is not inside of anything. Awareness is those direct experiences. 


I step back from the logic of doing and into the frame of being. 

Here the American vipassana (insight-based meditation) teacher Joseph Goldstein [describes his epiphany during a walking meditation](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/C2BA6D): 

>  Instead of watching the movement or observing the movement, it was simply to feel the movement, to feel the sensations of the movement. And in the feeling language, that's from the inside. 

> That’s a wonderfully concise and profound observation. Of course, I was inclined to agree with the sentiment because it captures something [I have been articulating](https://substack.com/redirect/45a986c8-cac8-4e12-888e-fffa69dc31d6?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc), at much greater length, for some time now. The world is not simply present to us in its fullness and depth by virtue of the fact that we are capable of glancing at it. Instead, if we are to see the world, we must attend to it with care, patience, and even love.
> This kind of attention can only unfold under certain conditions—solitude, silence, stillness—and in relation to certain virtues—humility, perseverance, charity. Among the conditions conducive to attentiveness I would also include deliberate slowness. Past a certain speed, we simply cannot perceive the world in depth." (The Convivial Society, The Ambling Mind)

> In order to get our minds around the experience of selflessness, it is useful to recall the deep connection between the sense of self, the understanding of experience in terms of subject-object duality, and of action in terms of free agency. To take ourselves to be selves [...] is to take ourselves to be subjects with a very different mode of existence than that we assign to our objects. It is to regard ourselves as standing *against* the world rather than as being embedded *in* it. And it is to take our self-knowledge to be immediate, as opposed to the mediated knowledge we have of our objects.[^2]

- like this phrase "scale of activity and experience appropriate to the human animal" (from The Convivial Society, The Ambling Mind)


> This unwinding of the tangled knot of seeking is the end of the conventional spiritual search. It is the deep understanding that nothing can be done as an individual, that the individual itself is a form of doing. [@spira-2008-transparency]

- Alan Watts [[skin encapsulated ego]]:
> Now it's very funny how we use the word I and if we just refer to common speech, we are not accustomed to say, 'I am a body'. We rather say 'I have a body'. We don't say 'I beat my heart' in the same way as we say, I walk, I think, I talk. We feel that our heart beats itself, and that has nothing very much to do with I. In other words, we don't regard I myself as identical with our whole physical organism. We regard it as something inside it.

> Since then, I’ve serendipitously encountered a handful of similar meditations on the value of walking, so I’ve taken that as sign to briefly gather some of these together and offer them to you, chiefly because they collectively remind us that there is a scale of activity and experience appropriate to the human animal and things tend to go well for us when we mind it." (The Convivial Society, The Ambling Mind)

> I am generally convinced by those who, in trying to describe the modern mode of relating to the world, find that it is best characterized as a relation of mastery and control, which is to say a relation of power. Positioned in this way, we are tempted to see the world, including ourselves, as a field of objects to be endlessly manipulated, optimized, and exploited. The world appears to us chiefly as raw material for our own projects. It is there primarily to be used and transformed to serve our purposes. [@sacasas-2022-two] 



> Śāntideva endorses this analysis in *How to Lead an Awakened Life,* and he draws ethical consequences from it. He argues that the dualism of self and other underlies egocentricity. That egocentricity, in turn, leads to a strong sense of self-identity, which causes us to see ourselves as standing at the center of our own moral universes, and so as objects of special regard. He argues that this dualism derives in turn from self-grasping, from seeing the world in terms of the “I and mine” framework that derives from reifying ourselves as selves. He also argues that this is the source of the illusion that others are independent agents. [@garfield-2022-losing]

> In the same sense, our awareness of our subjective states—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something immediately present, dually related to that which is other—is in fact just another aspect of our nondual embeddedness in that world. We participate in the construction of what we regard as external to us, and what is external to us participates in the construction of what we experience as the inner. In sum, the very dichotomy of self and other, inner and outer, is a construction, not a given. Much of our life is structured by the illusion that we just find what we in fact construct; but the fact that this illusion structures so much of our experience does not mean that it is not an illusion.[@garfield-2022-losing]


> Moreover, as we noted above, subject-object duality is better understood as a superimposition on a basically nondual experience than as an essential or a constitutive aspect of that experience. Subject-object duality, that is, reflects the way we represent our experience to ourselves (when we are actively doing so), not the way we actually experience the world ... [@garfield-2022-losing]

> In those special moments in which we need to become aware of our own subjectivity, doing so can facilitate our engagement with the world. But in most cases, that superimposition does not render us more effective or more aware of what transpires around us. Instead, it makes us less aware of our surroundings and of the objects or others to whom we should be attending; that is, it makes us self-conscious in the pejorative sense of that term. [@garfield-2022-losing]

Flow - stepping towards something 
 

And as we retreat further and further into our screens and captured by algorithmic longing .. this is a counter practice that matters more and more. 


I have a sneaky suspicion that Morton’s idea is at the heart of the transformation I experienced (and have experienced before) while working outdoors on site with Helen. 

The planet’s resources are available to exploit if and only if they are treated as objects separate from human subject-hood. This is the danger that Morton is referring to above and it is why 

> The idea that we’re outside the world looking in, deciding from a menu which choice to make, is precisely the dangerous illusion. 
– Timothy B. Morton [^1]

> I acknowledge the privilege of being alive in a human body at this moment, endowed with senses, memories, emotions, thoughts, and the space of mind in its wisdom aspect. —Alex Grey, “The Vast Expanse” [in @hamilton-2020-compassionate]

> That would be to see things in terms of inner and outer, self and other, subject and object. It would therefore also be to forget that as persons we are not only embodied, but embedded. And just as our bodies can fall either on the subject or the object side of our awareness, the environment beyond our bodies can do so as well. [@garfield-2022-losing]

> In this context, doubt is actually the valuable thing, the thing we want to seize. But encountering freshness and agency in this way, Arendt wrote, required someone to hold their ground “between the clashing waves of past and future.” Otherwise, you’d get flattened by certainty: The past would crush you with tradition, and the future would crush you with determinism. Hence the importance and fragility of the “gap” (another term for “non-time”) in the title of Arendt’s preface, “The Gap between Past and Future.” [@odell-2023-saving]

> What does it mean to be a ‘self’? While some have argued that there may be no ‘thing’ that is a self, experiences of selfhood are among the most pervasive aspects of human consciousness. Perceptions of the external world come and go, but it is their relation to the experience of ‘being an experiencing subject’ that gives these perceptions meaning, value, and emotional relevance. How perceptual experiences of ‘being a self’ are constructed is therefore a key question for cognitive science. [@seth-2018-being] 

> "Dōgen, like Nāgasena, is not arguing for our unreality, and he is certainly not arguing that we have no experience. He is arguing instead that our reality is that of embedded persons, not that of independent selves. He is also arguing that even though we may sometimes superimpose a dualistic structure on our experience, and even take that for granted as the way we encounter the world, that duality is a superimposition on a primordially nondual mode of awareness. While it might sometimes be useful to think in dualistic terms, to do so without awareness of the artificial, cognitive origin of that structure is to fail in self-understanding. [@garfield-2022-losing]

- being and having a body. see [[an object of special regard]] and Husserl and Helmuth Plessner. Who is the 'we' there. Grammatical trick in which the subject is removed. I am a body becomes body being known. The lack of a subject here, an "I", is a bit weird and begs the question, "by whom?". 

> Duality, the subject/object polarization, is inherent in the concepts of the mind. For instance, when we speak of the ‘body’ we refer to an object, which in turn implies a subject. If we explore this object we discover that it is non-existent as such and is in fact only a ‘sensation.’" (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

"Ultimately, we do all need a set of what Borgmann elsewhere calls *counter-practices* , a set of deliberately chosen practices that refuse the default settings of the device paradigm." (The Convivial Society, Why an Easier Life Is Not Necessarily Happier)

Here's something Helen Poynor wrote to me: "I was interested in the quote by Jay Garfield re selflessness – I feel most fully myself when alone in the environment – rather than it being an experience of standing against the world. I feel then also embedded in it. Also the site itself is dancing." ("and why are all the opposites to goal-directed so laden with negative connotations?") (postcard from her)

He is us. Making no mark.
