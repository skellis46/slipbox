[https://dark-mountain.net/submissions-call-for-dark-mountain-issue-27-on-bodies/](https://dark-mountain.net/submissions-call-for-dark-mountain-issue-27-on-bodies/)

  > Since the birth of Dark Mountain in 2010, contributors, and especially artists, have broken out of the studio confines to become the work themselves, using their bodies as an intervention against the ‘trance-state’ of civilisation. In times of abstraction and disconnection, as our attention is pulled away from the realities we inhabit and towards ethereal spaces untethered to geography, remembering our earthly bodies is a way to reconnect with the physicality of the living world. 

> We’d like to see thoughts that move our ideas of bodies into uncharted territory: how they cope with heat, cold, humidity and change. In what ways are bodies ecosystems, microclimates, engines and dynamos, compost? Can acknowledgement of the cycles of life create an acceptance of rot and death, leading to a stronger connection with the physical world?

## dark mountain draft

Now the rain is pelting down. I am standing with my arms outwards, head tilted upwards towards the heavens, blinded by the water as it plummets through this body and into the sand beneath my feet. Soaked. And cold to the bone in a northern summer.

Perhaps an hour earlier there is a large man lying shirtless on the side of the road. His car has drifted gently into a small wall and two woman are applying cardiac compressions to his cyanotic body. Their physical effort is unsurprising and shocking. The man is a creature crossing over into death; his torso more a carcass being coaxed and willed to survive by knowing and desperate hands.

And in the rain this simple practice begins. It is a practice that dissolves in and through the body; a soluble body being known. 

_description of practice._ 

we are given simple scores to follow that involve being in these environments for an uncertain amount of time. Instructions include “stay at animal height” or “sprawl with part of your body contacting a rock and another part the pebbles” or “move, then rest in presence, then move”. These scores are a guide, and their simplicity and clarity belies the the transformative complexity of being on and in these sites while weathering the weather. 


- [[body being known]]

- being and having a body. see [[an object of special regard]] and Husserl and Helmuth Plessner. Who is the 'we' there. Grammatical trick in which the subject is removed. I am a body becomes body being known. The lack of a subject here, an "I", is a bit weird and begs the question, "by whom?". 
- Stark-Smith: the gap; Morrissey: being a passenger 
- what _causes_ this experience? Or rather, what makes it possible to return to pure subject-less awareness? Could I name some? Not wanting; not judging; attention to direct experience; not goal-oriented; not therapeutic (which is a goal)
- what are implications of this? 

> In his latest and last book, _Mortality_, Christopher Hitchens writes, "I don't have a body, I am a body." (86) He goes on to observe that he has "consciously and regularly acted as if this was [_sic_] not true." (https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2012/09/am-i-a-body-or-do-i-have-a-body.html)



That man on the side of the road died. He died in the rain while two people pushed the weight of their bodies into his chest. The next day there were flowers to mark the spot, the same spot where that car did not even make a mark on the wall. He is us. Making no mark.


> In those special moments in which we need to become aware of our own subjectivity, doing so can facilitate our engagement with the world. But in most cases, that superimposition does not render us more effective or more aware of what transpires around us. Instead, it makes us less aware of our surroundings and of the objects or others to whom we should be attending; that is, it makes us self-conscious in the pejorative sense of that term. (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

- "In this context, doubt is actually the valuable thing, the thing we want to seize. But encountering freshness and agency in this way, Arendt wrote, required someone to hold their ground “between the clashing waves of past and future.” Otherwise, you’d get flattened by certainty: The past would crush you with tradition, and the future would crush you with determinism. Hence the importance and fragility of the “gap” (another term for “non-time”) in the title of Arendt’s preface, “The Gap between Past and Future.”" (Jenny Odell, Odell-2023-Saving)
