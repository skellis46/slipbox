  > Since the birth of Dark Mountain in 2010, contributors, and especially artists, have broken out of the studio confines to become the work themselves, using their bodies as an intervention against the ‘trance-state’ of civilisation. In times of abstraction and disconnection, as our attention is pulled away from the realities we inhabit and towards ethereal spaces untethered to geography, remembering our earthly bodies is a way to reconnect with the physicality of the living world. 

> We’d like to see thoughts that move our ideas of bodies into uncharted territory: how they cope with heat, cold, humidity and change. In what ways are bodies ecosystems, microclimates, engines and dynamos, compost? Can acknowledgement of the cycles of life create an acceptance of rot and death, leading to a stronger connection with the physical world?

## dark mountain draft

Now the rain is pelting down. I am standing with my arms outwards, head tilted upwards towards the heavens, blinded by the water as it plummets through this body and into the sand beneath my feet. Soaked. And cold to the bone in the middle of a British summer.

Perhaps an hour earlier there is a large man lying shirtless on the side of the road. His car has drifted gently into a small wall and now two woman are applying cardiac compressions to his cyanotic body. He is a creature crossing over into death; his torso more a carcass being coaxed and willed to survive by knowing and desperate hands.

And in the rain This simple practice begins. It is a practice that starts in and with the body ... dissolves. a body Soluble in water. 

- [[body being known]]

That man on the side of the road? He died. The next day there were flowers to mark the spot where that car didn't even make a mark on the wall. He is us. Making no mark.

- "In this context, doubt is actually the valuable thing, the thing we want to seize. But encountering freshness and agency in this way, Arendt wrote, required someone to hold their ground “between the clashing waves of past and future.” Otherwise, you’d get flattened by certainty: The past would crush you with tradition, and the future would crush you with determinism. Hence the importance and fragility of the “gap” (another term for “non-time”) in the title of Arendt’s preface, “The Gap between Past and Future.”" (Jenny Odell, Odell-2023-Saving)
