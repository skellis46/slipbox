  > Since the birth of Dark Mountain in 2010, contributors, and especially artists, have broken out of the studio confines to become the work themselves, using their bodies as an intervention against the ‘trance-state’ of civilisation. In times of abstraction and disconnection, as our attention is pulled away from the realities we inhabit and towards ethereal spaces untethered to geography, remembering our earthly bodies is a way to reconnect with the physicality of the living world. 

> We’d like to see thoughts that move our ideas of bodies into uncharted territory: how they cope with heat, cold, humidity and change. In what ways are bodies ecosystems, microclimates, engines and dynamos, compost? Can acknowledgement of the cycles of life create an acceptance of rot and death, leading to a stronger connection with the physical world?

## dark mountain draft

Now the rain is pelting down. I am standing with my arms outwards, head tilted up towards the skies, blinded by the water as it plummets through this body and into the body of sand beneath my feet. Soaked. And cold to the bone in a northern summer.

Perhaps an hour earlier when the rain had already begun its raining, there is a large man lying shirtless on the side of the road. His car has drifted gently into a small wall and two woman are applying cardiac compressions to his cyanotic body. Their physical effort is unsurprising and shocking. The man is a creature crossing over into death; his torso more a carcass being coaxed and willed to survive by knowing and desperate hands.

In the rain on the sand, this simple practice begins. It is a practice that dissolves in and through the body; a soluble [[body being known]]. It is also a counter-practice, a corporeal balm that resists the machinations of the default digital logic. In this practice we live as creatures not machines. 

The artist is Helen Poynor. She is a dancer, a choreographer, a conjurer. She is the real deal. She says "I feel most fully myself when alone in the environment – rather than it being an experience of standing against the world. I feel then also embedded in it." We are given scores to follow that involve being on site in different environments for an uncertain amount of time. There is the Iron Age hill fort called Blackbury Camp, or the tidal area under the cliffs down from Beer Beach where the cormorants nest along those same cliffs. Poynor's instructions include things like “stay at animal height” or “sprawl with part of your body contacting a rock and another part the pebbles” or “move, then rest in presence, then move”. The scores are a guide, and their simplicity belies the the transformative complexity of being on and in these sites while weathering the weather. 

Flow - stepping towards something 
Practice: stepping back. It's a non-task. 

"Otherwise put: humans do not possess agency; nor, for that matter, do non-humans. They are rather possessed by action. Karen Barad admits as much when she argues that agency ‘is an enactment, not something that someone or something has’ (Barad 2003: 826" (Tim Ingold, Making)
- Stark-Smith: the gap; Morrissey: being a passenger 
- what _causes_ this experience? Or rather, what makes it possible to return to pure subject-less awareness? Could I name some? Not wanting; not judging; attention to direct experience; not goal-oriented; not therapeutic (which is a goal)
- what are implications of this? 





> The idea that we’re outside the world looking in, deciding from a menu which choice to make, is precisely the dangerous illusion. 

– Timothy B. Morton [^1] 

I have a sneaky suspicion that Morton’s idea is at the heart of the transformation I experienced (and have experienced before) while working outdoors on site with Helen. In the time of the practice, it is as if my sense of subjecthood – of being an “I” outside or separate to the environment – starts to dissolve or even become meaningless. The feeling in those direct and extended experiences of being with dirt and rock and ocean and tree is of widening time and consciousness underpinned by profound humility. There is awe here in the diminishing scale of the self: it’s beautiful and discombobulating.

The planet’s resources are available to exploit if and only if they are treated as objects separate from human subject-hood. This is the danger that Morton is referring to above and it is why 

This is a different kind of selflessness. It is a return to the absence of self. It is the estranged and other twin to self-consciousness. 

- [[the body and the disappearing self]]
- [[skin encapsulated ego]]

> In order to get our minds around the experience of selflessness, it is useful to recall the deep connection between the sense of self, the understanding of experience in terms of subject-object duality, and of action in terms of free agency. To take ourselves to be selves [...] is to take ourselves to be subjects with a very different mode of existence than that we assign to our objects. It is to regard ourselves as standing *against* the world rather than as being embedded *in* it. And it is to take our self-knowledge to be immediate, as opposed to the mediated knowledge we have of our objects.[^2]



> In those special moments in which we need to become aware of our own subjectivity, doing so can facilitate our engagement with the world. But in most cases, that superimposition does not render us more effective or more aware of what transpires around us. Instead, it makes us less aware of our surroundings and of the objects or others to whom we should be attending; that is, it makes us self-conscious in the pejorative sense of that term. [@garfield-2022-losing]
 
> I am generally convinced by those who, in trying to describe the modern mode of relating to the world, find that it is best characterized as a relation of mastery and control, which is to say a relation of power. Positioned in this way, we are tempted to see the world, including ourselves, as a field of objects to be endlessly manipulated, optimized, and exploited. The world appears to us chiefly as raw material for our own projects. It is there primarily to be used and transformed to serve our purposes. [@sacasas-2022-two] 


> Moreover, as we noted above, subject-object duality is better understood as a superimposition on a basically nondual experience than as an essential or a constitutive aspect of that experience. Subject-object duality, that is, reflects the way we represent our experience to ourselves (when we are actively doing so), not the way we actually experience the world ... [@garfield-2022-losing]

> In the same sense, our awareness of our subjective states—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something immediately present, dually related to that which is other—is in fact just another aspect of our nondual embeddedness in that world. We participate in the construction of what we regard as external to us, and what is external to us participates in the construction of what we experience as the inner. In sum, the very dichotomy of self and other, inner and outer, is a construction, not a given. Much of our life is structured by the illusion that we just find what we in fact construct; but the fact that this illusion structures so much of our experience does not mean that it is not an illusion.[@garfield-2022-losing]

> We hence see that it is not the presence of explicit thought that distinguishes ego-involved experience from ego-less experience. Instead, this distinction reflects the degree of immersion in activity and so the degree to which explicit awareness of oneself as standing outside that activity is diminished. It is a distinction that is more phenomenological than psychological, having to do with how we experience our own engagement with the world. When we are completely immersed in activity—whether the physical activity of carving an ox or the cognitive activity of thinking about how best to carve that ox—our sense of self, and with it, the experience of the duality of subject and object in experience, vanish. There is only the experience of a flow of activity. [@garfield-2022-losing]

> Śāntideva endorses this analysis in *How to Lead an Awakened Life,* and he draws ethical consequences from it. He argues that the dualism of self and other underlies egocentricity. That egocentricity, in turn, leads to a strong sense of self-identity, which causes us to see ourselves as standing at the center of our own moral universes, and so as objects of special regard. He argues that this dualism derives in turn from self-grasping, from seeing the world in terms of the “I and mine” framework that derives from reifying ourselves as selves. He also argues that this is the source of the illusion that others are independent agents. [@garfield-2022-losing]

In these direct experiences (sensations?) -- pure experiences -- there is nothing for this practice to be reduced to. It is irreducible (after Latour) [[Muecke - The Generous Philosopher]]. And because it has no clear constituent parts on which the experience might be predicted, nor is it emergent. [[emergence]]? It has merely been gently set in motion and in the end -- as a matter of direct experience -- 

- [[pure experience is the same as direct experience]]


- [[the body from the inside]]
- Alan Watts [[skin encapsulated ego]]:
> Now it's very funny how we use the word I and if we just refer to common speech, we are not accustomed to say, 'I am a body'. We rather say 'I have a body'. We don't say 'I beat my heart' in the same way as we say, I walk, I think, I talk. We feel that our heart beats itself, and that has nothing very much to do with I. In other words, we don't regard I myself as identical with our whole physical organism. We regard it as something inside it.

These signs appear in awareness: pressure, tension, temperature. Yet awareness has no location. It is not inside of anything. It is just appearing as those same sensations, sounds, movements, thoughts. 


This practice matters not because of what it might do _for_ me (or whomever is engaged in the practice) but that it undermines _me-ness_. There is a deep softening of the outside site-as-object and as a matter of direct experience (even if fleetingly) “I” becomes site. It is the difference between me dancing the site, and the site being danced.

> This unwinding of the tangled knot of seeking is the end of the conventional spiritual search. It is the deep understanding that nothing can be done as an individual, that the individual itself is a form of doing. [@spira-2008-transparency]

That man on the side of the road died. He died in the rain while two people sweated and pushed the weight of their bodies through their arms and onto his chest. The next day there were flowers to mark the site. In his last unremarkable and unforgettable dance he whispered a reminder that sites are all always dancing, even in decay.

> I acknowledge the privilege of being alive in a human body at this moment, endowed with senses, memories, emotions, thoughts, and the space of mind in its wisdom aspect. —Alex Grey, “The Vast Expanse” [in @hamilton-2020-compassionate]

> That would be to see things in terms of inner and outer, self and other, subject and object. It would therefore also be to forget that as persons we are not only embodied, but embedded. And just as our bodies can fall either on the subject or the object side of our awareness, the environment beyond our bodies can do so as well. [@garfield-2022-losing]

> In this context, doubt is actually the valuable thing, the thing we want to seize. But encountering freshness and agency in this way, Arendt wrote, required someone to hold their ground “between the clashing waves of past and future.” Otherwise, you’d get flattened by certainty: The past would crush you with tradition, and the future would crush you with determinism. Hence the importance and fragility of the “gap” (another term for “non-time”) in the title of Arendt’s preface, “The Gap between Past and Future.” [@odell-2023-saving]

> What does it mean to be a ‘self’? While some have argued that there may be no ‘thing’ that is a self, experiences of selfhood are among the most pervasive aspects of human consciousness. Perceptions of the external world come and go, but it is their relation to the experience of ‘being an experiencing subject’ that gives these perceptions meaning, value, and emotional relevance. How perceptual experiences of ‘being a self’ are constructed is therefore a key question for cognitive science. [@seth-2018-being] 

> "Dōgen, like Nāgasena, is not arguing for our unreality, and he is certainly not arguing that we have no experience. He is arguing instead that our reality is that of embedded persons, not that of independent selves. He is also arguing that even though we may sometimes superimpose a dualistic structure on our experience, and even take that for granted as the way we encounter the world, that duality is a superimposition on a primordially nondual mode of awareness. While it might sometimes be useful to think in dualistic terms, to do so without awareness of the artificial, cognitive origin of that structure is to fail in self-understanding. [@garfield-2022-losing]

- being and having a body. see [[an object of special regard]] and Husserl and Helmuth Plessner. Who is the 'we' there. Grammatical trick in which the subject is removed. I am a body becomes body being known. The lack of a subject here, an "I", is a bit weird and begs the question, "by whom?". 

> Duality, the subject/object polarization, is inherent in the concepts of the mind. For instance, when we speak of the ‘body’ we refer to an object, which in turn implies a subject. If we explore this object we discover that it is non-existent as such and is in fact only a ‘sensation.’" (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

> In his latest and last book, _Mortality_, Christopher Hitchens writes, "I don't have a body, I am a body." (86) He goes on to observe that he has "consciously and regularly acted as if this was not true."

"Ultimately, we do all need a set of what Borgmann elsewhere calls *counter-practices* , a set of deliberately chosen practices that refuse the default settings of the device paradigm." (The Convivial Society, Why an Easier Life Is Not Necessarily Happier)

Here's something Helen Poynor wrote to me: "I was interested in the quote by Jay Garfield re selflessness – I feel most fully myself when alone in the environment – rather than it being an experience of standing against the world. I feel then also embedded in it. Also the site itself is dancing." ("and why are all the opposites to goal-directed so laden with negative connotations?") (postcard from her)

He is us. Making no mark.
