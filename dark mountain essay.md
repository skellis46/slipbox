## info from original call
[https://dark-mountain.net/submissions-call-for-dark-mountain-issue-27-on-bodies/](https://dark-mountain.net/submissions-call-for-dark-mountain-issue-27-on-bodies/)

  > Since the birth of Dark Mountain in 2010, contributors, and especially artists, have broken out of the studio confines to become the work themselves, using their bodies as an intervention against the ‘trance-state’ of civilisation. In times of abstraction and disconnection, as our attention is pulled away from the realities we inhabit and towards ethereal spaces untethered to geography, remembering our earthly bodies is a way to reconnect with the physicality of the living world. 

> We’d like to see thoughts that move our ideas of bodies into uncharted territory: how they cope with heat, cold, humidity and change. In what ways are bodies ecosystems, microclimates, engines and dynamos, compost? Can acknowledgement of the cycles of life create an acceptance of rot and death, leading to a stronger connection with the physical world?

## dark mountain draft

Now the rain is pelting down. I am standing with my arms outwards, head tilted upwards towards the heavens, blinded by the water as it plummets through this body and into the sand beneath my feet. Soaked. And cold to the bone in a northern summer.

Perhaps an hour earlier there is a large man lying shirtless on the side of the road. His car has drifted gently into a small wall and two woman are applying cardiac compressions to his cyanotic body. Their physical effort is unsurprising and shocking. The man is a creature crossing over into death; his torso more a carcass being coaxed and willed to survive by knowing and desperate hands.

And in the rain this simple practice begins. It is a practice that dissolves in and through the body; a soluble body being known. 

_description of practice._ 

we are given simple scores to follow that involve being in these environments for an uncertain amount of time. Instructions include “stay at animal height” or “sprawl with part of your body contacting a rock and another part the pebbles” or “move, then rest in presence, then move”. These scores are a guide, and their simplicity and clarity belies the the transformative complexity of being on and in these sites while weathering the weather. 

- [[where is you?]] -- something here for the sense of dissolution of body?? 

- [[body being known]]

- being and having a body. see [[an object of special regard]] and Husserl and Helmuth Plessner. Who is the 'we' there. Grammatical trick in which the subject is removed. I am a body becomes body being known. The lack of a subject here, an "I", is a bit weird and begs the question, "by whom?". 
- Stark-Smith: the gap; Morrissey: being a passenger 
- what _causes_ this experience? Or rather, what makes it possible to return to pure subject-less awareness? Could I name some? Not wanting; not judging; attention to direct experience; not goal-oriented; not therapeutic (which is a goal)
- what are implications of this? 

> In his latest and last book, _Mortality_, Christopher Hitchens writes, "I don't have a body, I am a body." (86) He goes on to observe that he has "consciously and regularly acted as if this was [_sic_] not true." (https://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2012/09/am-i-a-body-or-do-i-have-a-body.html)

> This unwinding of the tangled knot of seeking is the end of the conventional spiritual search. It is the deep understanding that nothing can be done as an individual, that the individual itself is a form of doing." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

That man on the side of the road died. He died in the rain while two people pushed the weight of their bodies into his chest. The next day there were flowers to mark the spot, the same spot where that car did not even make a mark on the wall. He is us. Making no mark.

Here's something Helen Poynor wrote to me: "I was interested in the quote by Jay Garfield re selflessness – I feel most fully myself when alone in the environment – rather than it being an experience of standing against the world. I feel then also embedded in it. Also the site itself is dancing." ("and why are all the opposites to goal-directed so laden with negative connotations?") (postcode from her)

Flow - stepping towards something 
Practice: stepping back. It's a non-task. 

> "Dōgen, like Nāgasena, is not arguing for our unreality, and he is certainly not arguing that we have no experience. He is arguing instead that our reality is that of embedded persons, not that of independent selves. He is also arguing that even though we may sometimes superimpose a dualistic structure on our experience, and even take that for granted as the way we encounter the world, that duality is a superimposition on a primordially nondual mode of awareness. While it might sometimes be useful to think in dualistic terms, to do so without awareness of the artificial, cognitive origin of that structure is to fail in self-understanding." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

> "What does it mean to be a ‘self’? While some have argued that there may be no ‘thing’ that is a self [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0005), experiences of selfhood are among the most pervasive aspects of human consciousness. Perceptions of the external world come and go, but it is their relation to the experience of ‘being an experiencing subject’ that gives these perceptions meaning, value, and emotional relevance. How perceptual experiences of ‘being a self’ are constructed is therefore a key question for cognitive science." (sciencedirect.com, Being a Beast Machine: The Somatic Basis of Selfhood)

> In those special moments in which we need to become aware of our own subjectivity, doing so can facilitate our engagement with the world. But in most cases, that superimposition does not render us more effective or more aware of what transpires around us. Instead, it makes us less aware of our surroundings and of the objects or others to whom we should be attending; that is, it makes us self-conscious in the pejorative sense of that term. (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

> In the same sense, our awareness of our subjective states—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something immediately present, dually related to that which is other—is in fact just another aspect of our nondual embeddedness in that world. We participate in the construction of what we regard as external to us, and what is external to us participates in the construction of what we experience as the inner. In sum, the very dichotomy of self and other, inner and outer, is a construction, not a given. Much of our life is structured by the illusion that we just find what we in fact construct; but the fact that this illusion structures so much of our experience does not mean that it is not an illusion. (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

- "I acknowledge the privilege of being alive in a human body at this moment, endowed with senses, memories, emotions, thoughts, and the space of mind in its wisdom aspect. —Alex Grey, “The Vast Expanse”" (Diane Musho Hamilton, Compassionate Conversations How to Speak and Listen From the Heart)

"We hence see that it is not the presence of explicit thought that distinguishes ego-involved experience from ego-less experience. Instead, this distinction reflects the degree of immersion in activity and so the degree to which explicit awareness of oneself as standing outside that activity is diminished. It is a distinction that is more phenomenological than psychological, having to do with how we experience our own engagement with the world. When we are completely immersed in activity—whether the physical activity of carving an ox or the cognitive activity of thinking about how best to carve that ox—our sense of self, and with it, the experience of the duality of subject and object in experience, vanish. There is only the experience of a flow of activity." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

"Śāntideva endorses this analysis in *How to Lead an Awakened Life,* and he draws ethical consequences from it. He argues that the dualism of self and other underlies egocentricity. That egocentricity, in turn, leads to a strong sense of self-identity, which causes us to see ourselves as standing at the center of our own moral universes, and so as objects of special regard. He argues that this dualism derives in turn from self-grasping, from seeing the world in terms of the “I and mine” framework that derives from reifying ourselves as selves. He also argues that this is the source of the illusion that others are independent agents." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

- "In this context, doubt is actually the valuable thing, the thing we want to seize. But encountering freshness and agency in this way, Arendt wrote, required someone to hold their ground “between the clashing waves of past and future.” Otherwise, you’d get flattened by certainty: The past would crush you with tradition, and the future would crush you with determinism. Hence the importance and fragility of the “gap” (another term for “non-time”) in the title of Arendt’s preface, “The Gap between Past and Future.”" (Jenny Odell, Odell-2023-Saving)
