# diffuse attention

_previous note:_ [[internal and external attention]]

In Claire Loussouarn's 2021 IJSD article called _Moving with the Screen on Zoom: Reconnecting with Bodily and Environmental Awareness_ she calls on Adrienne Prettyman's thinking about _diffuse attention_:

> There are numerous examples that point to the phenomenon of diffuse attention in vision and across modalities – watching a landscape, feeling the whole body, listening to the sound of a noisy room. Yet diffuse attention is difficult to operationally define, and it is not clear that it should be considered a way of attending at all, rather than a way of being diffusely aware.[Prettyman, in @loussouarn-2021-moving p.84]

- seems not dissimilar to Deborah Hay's description of seeing (as a whole body thing, near, close and far, etc)
- Prettyman (and Loussouarn) contrasts with _visual focal attention_
- I used to describe what might be the same thing as watching with 'light eyes'
- [[paying attention]]
- [[path and attention of the camera]] -- this is a tangential link, but the "opposite directions" part hinted at a scenario in which attention is more diffuse???
