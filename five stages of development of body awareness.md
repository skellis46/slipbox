# five stages of development of body awareness

_previous note:_ [[definition of body awareness]]

Mehling cites Gadow's model of four stages of development of body awareness:

1. taking body for granted
2. averse relationship to uncomfortable sensations
3. accepting physical symptoms as useful information for one's body
4. appreciating the wisdom of the body for helping to make decisions.

Mehling's suggests that experienced body awareness practitioners might add a fifth stage:

5. non-conceptual awareness of body and mind as one

Mehling questions the logic of the linear progression, but even more difficult is 'capturing' any development for research purposes.[@mehling-2020-if pp.254-255]
