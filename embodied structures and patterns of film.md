# embodied structures and patterns of film

_previous note:_  [[touch and film]]  

---

Barker talks about her detailed analysis of sound and image to "reveal certain patterns of texture, space, and rhythm enacted by films and viewers."[@barker_tactile_2009 p.4] She suggests that by attending to these "embodied structures and patterns"[p.4] it is possible to create a "sensually formed" understanding of meaning between the bodies of film and viewers.  

_questions & thoughts:_

- why is it that these structures are embodied?  
- what is gained by using the language of _embodiment_ in order to make sense of (or perhaps justify) tactility (and intimacy) in film?  
- it would be worth my while tracking down this 'turn' towards the body in film. Perhaps Sobchack is the most likely place to go. See for instance [_The Address of the Eye_](zotero://select/items/1_RVQJI2V4) (1992) that demonstrates "that a film does indeed live an embodied existence in the world"[@barker_tactile_2009 p.8]
