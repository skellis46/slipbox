# pulling the thread of one duration

_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

> Peter Osborne writes of temporal multiplicity that “the distinctive conceptual grammar of con-temporaneity” is that of “a coming together not simply ‘in’ time, but of times: the present is increasingly characterized by a coming together of different but equally ‘present’ tem- [p.13]poralities or ‘times,’ a temporal unity in disjunction, or a disjunctive unity of present times.”31 Using a number of metaphors to convey the “polytemporality of the present,” the fluid and unpredictable nature of time in social contexts, Steven Connor asserts a compatible perspective:[@burges-2016-introduction pp.12-13]
>> In contemporality, the thread of one duration is pulled constantly through the loop formed by another, one temporality is strained through another’s mesh; but the resulting knot can itself be retied, and the filtered system also simultaneously refilters the system through which it is percolating. The scoring of time constituted by one temporality is played out on temporal instruments for which it may never have been intended, but which give it its music precisely in the way they change its metre and phrasings, and remix its elements.[Connor, in @burges-2016-introduction pp.12-13]

- this thread of duration being pulled through the loop of another thread is a useful image/concept for [[footfall]]
