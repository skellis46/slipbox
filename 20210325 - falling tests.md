- I start to go to the ground while the camera is in the air. The camera tosses are a little more intentional (trying to keep camera from rotating so much) -- like a tennis toss while serving. This footage is amazing in audio and how my body is in relation to the camera -- like a puzzle.
- thinking about the quality of the red skin when camera is in hand (and my hand is obscuring the lens) and the kinds of sounds that are happening then. Something very special. One simple structure is to divide into sections and have multiple versions of each section -- kind of linear.

 - more like short fast flicks of the camera
 - #ideatotry series of edits of the moment of impact
 - #ideatotry series of edits of the camera flying -- just clouds and sky
 - #ideatotry series of edits of just my face before impact
 - #ideatotry tie camera to piece of string to change type of movement in air -- a bit like a yo-yo
 - #ideatotrydone - make key for types of things to look out for [[20210407 - key coding]]
