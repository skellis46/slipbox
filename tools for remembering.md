# tools for remembering

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]

> It is not only our experience of the present that digital media refashions but also our relationship, through memory, to the past. “What anthropologists distinguish as ‘cultures,’” [Ivan Illich wrote](https://archive.org/details/IvanIllichInTheVineyardOfTheTextACommentaryToHughsDidascaliconUniversityOfChicagoPress1996/page/n47/mode/2up), “the historian of mental spaces might distinguish as different ‘memories.’ The way to recall, to remember, has a history which is, to some degree, distinct from the history of the substance that is remembered.” We are, at least in part, what we remember, both as individuals and as a society, and *what* we remember is a function of *how* we remember, of our tools for remembering — texts, images, monuments, social media feeds. A change in tools is also a change of the self and its relation to society. There are few more important effects of digital technologies than their propensity to reorder how and what we remember. [@sacasas-2020-analog n.pag.]

- what we remember is dependent on how we remember -- our tools for remembering 
- that last sentence is the work really!
