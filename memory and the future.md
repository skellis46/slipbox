# memory and the future

_previous note:_ [[gadamer and understanding as an event]]

---

Margaret Heffernan is a businesswoman, author and Professor of Practice at the University of Bath. In her book _Uncharted_ she discusses people, organisations, and projects which seem to function in spite of uncertainty about the future.

In Chapter 2 _Does History Repeat Itself?_ Heffernan describes how one of the many functions of memory is to "simulate the future."[@heffernan_uncharted_2020 Chapter 2, n.p.] Indeed, we need a sense of the past in order to sense the future, and that a key part of the brain's function is in planning for the future. 

At the top of the Chapter, Heffernan quotes Toni Morrison:

>To remember this world is to create it.[@heffernan_uncharted_2020 Chapter 2, n.p.]
