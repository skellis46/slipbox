# the natural world does not question the timing of its birth and death

_previous note:_ [[ancestry is not a lineage]]

David Chai is a philosopher of Daoism based in Hong Kong. In this brief article for _Psyche_ he introduces how Daoism describe circular cosmological time instead of human-measured time.

> The primary contribution Daoism makes to our understanding of time lies in its view that time is not linear but circular. What is more, the central concept of Daoism – the Dao – cannot be said to exist within or beyond time, which would imply it either has being or is without being. Rather the Dao is concurrently being _and_ non-being.[@chai-2021-there n.pag]

Chai uses the four seasons to help us understand time that is circular and not linear. The seasons exist in a state of continuous change, and it "occurs in a spectrum of time unknowable to those who mark time in halting, linear steps."[@chai-2021-there n.pag]

A key aspect of cosmological time -- and in Daosim more broadly -- is that there is no distinction between self and other, or being and non-being. Linear human-measured time is only possible if we make that distinction.

> This is why Daoism argues that humanity’s perspective of reality is inherently limited, so long as we engage things from the standpoint of our own being. Human-measured time is but a mental construct designed to ease the anxiety we feel over our own mortality. Daoism holds such anxiety to be illogical in that all things are born and all things perish. The difference between ourselves and the natural world is that the latter doesn’t question the timing of its birth and death, nor attempt to alter its fate. Human-measured time, therefore, is unable to account for the variegated changes that happen in the world because some of them help to prolong life while others work to shorten it. Our linear way of thinking is hence shattered when we encounter a situation wherein time can’t be counted or visualised. This cosmological time is more genuine than human-measured time insofar as it dissolves the need for a carefully delineated temporal order to which we can attach the names past, present and future.[@chai-2021-there n.pag]

Chai includes a story from Daoism’s central text, the _Zhuangzi_, about the death of Zhuangzi's wife, and what he says when asked by a friend why he has stopped grieving:

> I looked back to her beginning and the time before she was born. Not only the time before she was born, but the time before she had a body. Not only the time before she had a body, but the time before she had a spirit. In the midst of the jumble of wonder and mystery, a change took place and she had a spirit. Another change and she had a body. Another change and she was born. Now there’s been another change and she’s dead. It’s just like the progression of the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, winter.

And so, Chai says, there has never been a time when Zhuangzi's wife did not exist, and what makes her existence and non-existence possible is the Dao. 

> By retraining ourselves to reside in the in-betweenness of things, we can release ourselves from the notion that time is being-centric, and consider the alternative: time is the resting nothingness of the Dao. This non-being is not a nihilistic threat to being but its natural counterpart. As the root of being and non-being, the temporal and spatial nature of the Dao cannot be limited to either of these terms. The Dao, therefore, operates in the time of non-time and resides in the space of non-space.

Before human beings the Dao was unnamed undisturbed and "existed in perfect equanimity and quietude."[@chai-2021-there n.pag] Human beings introduced naming things and the concept of time to try and describe the nature of Dao and, most importantly, "justify our self-elevated standing in the world."[@chai-2021-there n.pag]
