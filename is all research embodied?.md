# is all research embodied?

_previous note:_ 

A brief provocation for Teoma Naccarato: <https://www.provocations.online/researchembodiment/>

If all knowledge is embodied, and all practices that generate and enact knowledge are embodied, then I think the question becomes, 'How are different research practices and processes embodied differently or uniquely?' That is, are there types of embodiment that are different by kind or degree? My hunch is that research that explicitly calls itself embodied is done so by a subject giving the body some kind of status as a special kind of object (but an object nevertheless). But who is this subject laying claim to the body as object if indeed their research is embodied? There is a grammatical 'trick' that goes like this: The phrases "I am a body", "I have a body" or even "I know my body" can become: "body being", "body having", "body known" or even "body being known". If there is body being known, then known by what? Radically embodied research would mean that there is nothing to be found at this point. 


The body being known holds regardless of whether we think of the body as what is contained by a bag of skin (Alan Watts' memorable term) or bodies that extend beyond that bag.

How might the "I" as subject be removed. 

The science-fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin noted just how badly objectification has gone for human-kind. How then to subjectify embodiment by rendering it as non-dual? Our language is one way. 

This comes directly from conversation between Sam Harris and Joseph Goldstein in which Goldstein describes a grammatical 'trick' that removes the subject. For instance, "I know the apple" (or I am knowing this apple) becomes "Apple being known". It got me thinking about knowing the body and how it might be written or spoken as: 

- I am a body
- I have a body 
- I am knowing my body

And these might become versions of:

- body being
- body having 
- body known
- body being known

The critical thing that this structure affords is the subsequent question: known by what? 

Body being known. Known by what? (and that there is nothing to find at that point -- non dual awareness). It seems to me that this might be a way of understanding embodiment. 

Note how Leder in [[the lived body and embodiment]] hints at this (through writing of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and Straus) but it's so difficult to write about as slips into subject-object constructions: "organised around my corporeal position". Also seems to make the body a special kind of object -- which I am not convinced it is (or that we gain anything by making it so)

> In those special moments in which we need to become aware of our own subjectivity, doing so can facilitate our engagement with the world. But in most cases, that superimposition does not render us more effective or more aware of what transpires around us. Instead, it makes us less aware of our surroundings and of the objects or others to whom we should be attending; that is, it makes us self-conscious in the pejorative sense of that term. (Jay Garfield)


Body as bag of skin (Alan watts)  "myth of myself" -- from Waking Up app

- embodiment as we tend to use it (even though it is used in wildly different ways) seems to be predicated on the body as special kind of object, but an object nevertheless. See [[the lived body and embodiment#^844cda]]. On this point see also [[the body in artistic research#^b4be45]] and Le Guin on just how badly objectification has gone for human-kind and our planet.

See [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#opportunities]] for useful things to add at end of this presentation.
