# still heads

Here are 19 seconds of a Red-tailed Hawk filmed by Bill Bryant. It's exquisite.

That bird head reminded me of an eerie film project called _7777_ by the artist Noah Kalina developed in collaboration with Michael Notter (visuals) and Paul O'Mara (sound):

_7777_ is based on a long-term project by Kalina called _Everyday_ in which he has taken a [photo of himself everyday](https://www.noahkalina.com/everyday/#2) since 2000. 

I was introduced to both of these videos through [Jason Kottke's website]https://kottke.org) -- surely the most remarkable curation of the internet (since 1998!).

Both videos, rather curiously, reminded me of that moment in the video of Michael Jackson's _Black or White_ when that face morphing thing happened. Remember? I can't embed the link here but the part I'm talking about kicks in at about [5:30min](https://youtu.be/F2AitTPI5U0). By the way, that video has not aged well.

Speaking of aging well, or not ...

In 2004 (I would have been about 35) Cormac Lally shot some video footage of me for a dance installation called [Inert](https://www.skellis.net/inert). Last year I attempted to replicate or perhaps re-perform that video, 15 years later. Here they are side by side:

I guess I could have attempted to overlay the footage in some hackneyed face-morphing-on-the-cheap kind of way (but I didn't):


I'm not so clear what is the point of this rather odd collection of videos. Perhaps it's an attempt to draw a tenuous line between quite distinct materials, ideas and practices. Perhaps it's an offer to reflect on time and aging; to look at an old photo and see those same eyes, that same wry smile. Perhaps it's because in all of them I see movement -- movement through time and through space. Perhaps each of them reveal in their own way bodies wrestling with  being and staying alive.
