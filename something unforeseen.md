# something unforeseen

_previous note:_ [[valorising vagueness]]

>Most questions prepare the terrain for their potential answers, but sometimes one is lucky enough to come up with a question that points at something unforeseen, at a tiny spark of contingency, at an inconspicuous spot where an unknown future nests so eloquently that we cannot but start tracing it in the midst of everything. A future that already has passed without any fuss? Perhaps. This kind of question bothers. How could it emerge in the first place?[@elo-2017-faq p.49]

>I consider artistic research practices a nascent set of cultural techniques, that is, operative processes of reproducing, handing down and passing on whatever remains of life: traces, patterns, artefacts. They are processes of differentiation. This abstract characterization of artistic research practices remains rather generic, since what difference does a difference make without some kind of relational setting? In more binding terms, however, artistic research practices show a peculiarity not limited to any specific context: they are transformative, which means that they deliberately touch upon their own opacity.[p.50]

>Instead of being means to an end – that is how functional, or ‘transparent,’ cultural techniques conceive themselves – artistic research practices problematize the relation between means and ends. In this respect, they are intimately related to the arts. But unlike artistic work that still can find its end in its own unfolding circles and in the safe havens of art worlds, artistic research is driven somewhere else: into the contested space of cultural activity and negotiation where a self-contained artwork does not work anymore; and there is nothing heroic about this impasse.[p.50]

>Analogically to medical uses of the word ‘syndrome,’ artistic research syndrome (why not call it ars from now on, and thus give a new future to an old name?) is a cultural condition characterized by a set of loosely associated symptoms that all relate to displacement of sense.[p.51]

>Let me note that the terms ‘symptom’ and ‘syndrome’ do not refer here to any features that might be viewed as pathological. Rather, they signal that the ‘issue’ or epistemological core of artistic research is not fixed – some even say it is empty – and appears only indirectly at the intersections or boundaries of different contexts.[p.51]
- wow. Got me thinking about nuclear cores. meltdown. also see [[a border is not a boundary]] But what does it mean? How does it appear? How do we recognise it?
