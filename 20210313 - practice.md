# 20210313 - practice

Spending some time with the footage I've shot. 

Imagined having Finn or someone doing throwing and catching while I move in the space below #ideatotry  ^0bde27

Thought about just dropping to the ground as quickly as possible and finding unusual/strange ways to catch the camera. #ideatotry Do I need to pad the camera to make it easier to catch? How would that work?  ^33c23c

Find ways of interupting the falling and moving camera -- almost as if tripping it up or disturbing its trajectory #ideatotrydone [[20210316 - settings and trees]] -- using the tree to trip the camera (amazing) 

Definitely try a quick edit when the camera is never being caught, or in some way attempting to disguise how/what is happening? #ideatotry  ^217c49

Wondering about words to say during the throwing/catching, or perhaps making some kind of sounds #ideatotrydone [[20210316 - settings and trees#^e91f53]]  But any kind of text (say text spoken over the top of the video or displayed on the project) needs to be thought through carefully. What am I doing here? Who/what is this in relationship to? See efforts with [[20210407 - he is painfully aware (2nd edit)]] and [[20210315 - thinking about metaphors and themes]]

Who might build a soundtrack/score? 

Need to work with camera much more like hot potatoes #ideatotry  ^0ef08c
