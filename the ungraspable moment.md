# the ungraspable moment

_previous note:_ [[losing one's self]]

These brief notes are from James Low's contribution to Waking Up app. It's the session called _The Ungraspable Moment_:

<https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO9D350>

- 2:30min: "Mental activity creates worlds it does not reveal them"
- 06:25min: "What you grasp is a conceptualisation of the experience which is not the same as the experience". 

> Concepts are a mask. Language is a mask. 

> It (the thing) becomes something when it is packaged in thought. 

> Give yourself to the moment of contact. Immediacy. 

- 34:30min:  "Once you pay a lot of attention to the detail of the object you get sucked into some kind of judgement and evaluation."
