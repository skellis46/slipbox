# definition of body awareness

_previous note:_ [[definition of mindfulness]]

> Body awareness is the perception of bodily states, processes and actions that is presumed to originate from sensory proprioceptive and interoceptive afferents and that an individual has the capacity to be aware of. Body awareness includes the perception of specific physical sensations (e.g., awareness of heart activity; proprioception of limb position) as well as complex syndromes (e.g., pain; sense of relaxation; ‘somatic markers’ of emotions). Body awareness is hypothesized as the product of an interactive and dynamic, emergent process that (a) reflects complex afferent, efferent, forward- and back- projecting neural activities, (b) includes cognitive appraisal and unconscious gating, and (c) is shaped by the person’s attitudes, beliefs, experience and learning in a social and cultural context. (Mehling et al., 2009, p. 4)[@mehling-2020-if p.254]

Mehling writes how, neurologically, body awareness is the part of [[proprioception]] and [[interoception]] that we can be aware of. Contrast this with interoceptive information that is not conscious.
