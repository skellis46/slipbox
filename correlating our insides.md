# correlating our insides

_previous note:_ [[interoception science overview]]

I've been reading a lot of science lately; mostly neuroscience to do something you may well have heard of called _interoception_. Before I get into interoception, reading these research papers reminded me of how much specialised knowledge is needed to understand statistical analysis and the presentation of quantitative data.

I know some of you will be able to read that information quickly and easily but it made my head spin. Nevertheless, there's one thing I remember very well from my science days: **correlation does not imply causation**. In the above excerpt from Christensen, Gaigg and Calvo-Merino's _I can feel my heartbeat: Dancers have increased interoceptive accuracy_,[^ch] there is a statistical difference between the groups of dancers and non-dancers in their ability to perceive their heartbeats ... but the data reveal nothing about what causes this difference.

[^ch]: Christensen, Julia F., Sebastian B. Gaigg, and Beatriz Calvo-Merino. ‘I Can Feel My Heartbeat: Dancers Have Increased Interoceptive Accuracy’. _Psychophysiology_ 55, no. 4 (April 2018): e13008, p.5. [https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13008](https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13008).

On to interoception ...

Scientists categorise body awareness as exteroceptive or interoceptive. Exteroceptive body awareness (also known as _the body schema_) is:

> the implicit knowledge we have of our body in relation to space and movement. It results from the integration of multimodal exteroceptive signals (e.g., vision, sound, touch), vestibular and proprioceptive systems, and voluntary motor systems.[^1]

Gaete. ‘Exteroceptive and Interoceptive Body-Self Awareness in Fibromyalgia Patients’. _Frontiers in Human Neuroscience_ 11 (13 March 2017), p.2. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00117](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00117).

Interoceptive body awareness is the perception of our internal state and provides "a sense of the physiological condition of the entire body"[^2] and "a representation of the feeling self that seems to differentiate humans from non-human primates."[^craig2] In other words, the human sense of self is underpinned by interoceptive body awareness.[^damasio]

[^damasio]: If you are interested in more on this I recommend Antonio Damasio's 2021 book _Feeling & Knowing: Making Minds Conscious_.

Dancers spend a lot of time tuning the feeling of their bodies: both internally and externally in space. Indeed, you could say that dance training of all kinds -- ballet, somatic practices, hip-hop, tap, jazz, ballroom, contemporary -- offers various ways of sensitising one's body to the world and to itself. That even the most extreme displays of virtuosity are built on the capacity to sense one's self.

Christensen et al's research is a small step to provide statistical evidence that dancers feel their bodies differently. For those of you who have spent any time training in dancing, this might seem obvious, but is it simply that people with unusual interoceptive abilities tend towards dancing, or does dancing develop those abilities?
