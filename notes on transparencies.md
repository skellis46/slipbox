# notes on transparencies

_previous note:_ [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project]]

Sue mentioned to Charlotte (in October 2023) something about the Mnemosyne Atlas:

> [Sue] said that during the process she got really interested in the Mnemosyne Atlas. While I think she found out about the atlas after she had started her transparencies process, it did influence her thinking.Â I thought it might be useful to reference this in an application to show some solidity in the method. - Charlotte Waelde, email 11 October 2023

## message to CW

- back on 28 September you wrote (to me):

> Are we using the art project 'Transparencies'? Or are we using the methodology/process that has resulted in Transparencies?

I remain unclear about this. The reason I am unclear is that I think it's superficial (or perhaps odd) to distinguish between the process to make T and T itself. Deborah Hay once said that "99% of my choreography is the practice of my choreography" -- making a distinction between the 'process' and the 'outcome' is hard for me to make sense of. 

Given your two questions though, where do you stand on them? Do you see one as being more useful (or perhaps 'valid')? And why?
