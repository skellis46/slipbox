# making as a confluence of forces and materials

_previous note:_ [[the skilled practitioner is responsive]]

> To read making longitudinally, as a confluence of forces and materials, rather than laterally, as a transposition from image to object, is to regard it as such a form-generating – or morphogenetic – process. This is to soften any distinction we might draw between organism and artefact. [@ingold-2013-making]
