# humans blush

> This brings me to another odd quirk of Homo sapiens. Machiavelli, in his classic book, advises never revealing your emotions. Work on your poker face, he urges; shame serves no purpose. The object is to win, by fair means or foul. But if only the shameless win, why are humans the only species in the whole animal kingdom to blush?
> Blushing, said Charles Darwin, is ‘the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions’. Wanting to know if this phenomenon was universal, he sent letters to everyone in his foreign network, polling missionaries, merchants, and colonial bureaucrats.11 Yes, they all replied, people here blush, too.
> But why? Why didn’t blushing die out?[@bregman-2020-humankind Part 1, Chapter 3 The Rise of Homo Puppy, Section 1, n.pag.]

> Human beings, it turns out, are ultrasocial learning machines. We’re born to learn, to bond and to play. Maybe it’s not so strange, then, that blushing is the only human expression that’s uniquely human. Blushing, after all, is quintessentially social – it’s people showing they care what others think, which fosters trust and enables cooperation.[@bregman-2020-humankind Part 1, Chapter 3 The Rise of Homo Puppy, Section 5, n.pag.]
