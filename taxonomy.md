# taxonomy

_previous note:_ [[dance and embodiment]]

> If you’ve been frustrated with a price list, a menu, a user interface or a bookshelf, it’s because someone didn’t spend the time to understand the expected taxonomy.

> When we sort our stuff, we’re telling people a story. A story about our stuff and a story about how we see the world.

> We don’t have to like the fact that the world demands a taxonomy, but we can accept that it does. Strangers want to know what shelf to put us on." (Seth Godin, Taxonomy as a Service)

Possible idea both for how we tell people about C-DaRE but also about The Body Problem with Scott?
