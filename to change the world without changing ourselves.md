# to change the world without changing ourselves

_previous note:_ [[genuine emergency and cultural output]]

> Berry observes, “The deal we are being offered appears to be that we can change the world without changing ourselves.” This kind of thinking enables us to continue using too much energy “of whatever color,” hoping that “fields of solar panels and ranks of gigantic wind machines” will absolve us of guilt as consumers. Which is not to say that Berry renounces the use of green energy. He posed for a photograph several years ago in front of the solar panels by his house, grinning and flashing a peace sign.[Wendell Berry, in @wickenden-2022-wendell n.pag]

In the same New Yorker essay:

> Nearly every one of us, nearly every day of his life, is contributing directly to the ruin of this planet. - Wendell Berry, 1971 "Think Little"


> Berry distrusts political movements, which, he writes, “soon decline from any possibility of reasonable discourse to slogans, shouts, and a merely hateful contention in the capitols and streets.” [@wickenden-2022-wendell n.pag.]

> In “The Need to Be Whole,” he argues that the problem of race is inextricable from the violent abuse of our natural resources, and that “white people’s part in slavery and all the other outcomes of race prejudice, so damaging to its victims,” has also been “gravely damaging to white people.” The book’s subtitle is “Patriotism and the History of Prejudice.” [@wickenden-2022-wendell n.pag.]
