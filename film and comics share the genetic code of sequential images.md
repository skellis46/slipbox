# film and comics share the genetic code of sequential images

_previous note:_ [[time in comics is represented as territory in space]]

> Film and comics might share the genetic code of sequential images epitomized by Muybridge’s horse, but film after 1905 worked to make that code invisible to the viewer. Comics was the first narrative medium dedicated to imaginatively exploring a model of time that allowed for the past, present, and future to exist simultaneously. The reasons for this were primarily formal. For example, the space between panels is known in comics as the “gutter”; in film it is not known at all, because it is not visible once the film is projected. Thus in classical Hollywood cinema the frame effectively disappears from the viewer’s focus, while it remains visible in comics, often penetrated or fractured in ways that serve only to call further attention to its material boundaries.[@gardner-2016-serial p.166]

- this was a rather astounding moment for me -- slipping in and out of consciousness (head drooping as I was reading), thinking about some kind of comic strip of timelapses for [[footfall]] (as first described here in [[time in comics is represented as territory in space]]) and then this excerpt above from Gardner linked current preoccupations (re timelapse) with that old work I was doing with 'reels' of still images as in [strip test](https://vimeo.com/394155233/dad4105074) The possibility of playing -- in [[footfall]] -- with different panels and gutters, perhaps even with hand drawn feel.
