# the materials that perdure

_previous note:_ [[Ingold on kiteflying, action and the dance of agency]]

> Yet as a gathering of materials in motion, of sticks and air, it is undoubtedly a thing (Figure 7.9). For [artist Andy] Goldsworthy, the strength of a work lies precisely in the 'energies' emanating from materials in their movement, growth and decay, and in the fleeting moments when they come together as one (quoted in Friedman 1996: 10). Here it is the materials that perdure, not the more or less transitory forms into which they are cast. Throwing, as Goldsworthy shows us, and as our experiments in kite-flying proved, is not so much the outward effect of an embodied agency as the propulsion of animate being as it spills out into the world. Such, indeed, is the propulsion of life itself. [@ingold-2013-making p.104]

I'm thinking here that Ingold's _spilling out into the world_ might somehow relate to the practice of [[authentic movement]] that Katye and I are doing in [[losing oneself]]. It's not quite right though because what might the 'materials' be in the movement practice (compared with these sticks of Ingold's kite flying)?
