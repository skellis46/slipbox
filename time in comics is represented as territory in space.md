# time in comics is represented as territory in space

_previous note:_ [[tensed time as moving or fixed]]

> In comics, the individual moments of time are not projected at twenty-four frames per second to create the illusion of movement, but instead, as Scott Bukatman puts it, “time in comics is represented as territory in space.”15 [@gardner-2016-serial p.165]

- in [[footfall]] I could give the film the sense of being a comic -- several different sized panels. See also [elements of a comic book](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-create-a-comic-book-step-by-step-guide-for-making-your-own-comics#what-are-the-elements-of-a-good-comic-book): panel, gutter, tier, splash, spread, caption, speech bubble/balloon. Also having a full background image on which panels are presented. 
- see also [terminology in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_comics_terminology)
- even the possibility of the film being a series of pages (each with a different panel or panels) and some kind of transition between pages -- cut to black?
- noting how this simple idea of comic strips (panels on a page) isn't so far off the desktop performances I've been making; e.g. [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
