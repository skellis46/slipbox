# time in comics is represented as territory in space

_previous note:_ [[tensed time as moving or fixed]]

> In comics, the individual moments of time are not projected at twenty-four frames per second to create the illusion of movement, but instead, as Scott Bukatman puts it, “time in comics is represented as territory in space.”15 [@gardner-2016-serial p.165]

- in [[footfall]] I could give the film the sense of being a comic -- several different sized panels. See also [elements of a comic book](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-create-a-comic-book-step-by-step-guide-for-making-your-own-comics#what-are-the-elements-of-a-good-comic-book): panel, gutter, tier, splash, spread, caption, speech bubble/balloon. Also having a full background image on which panels are presented.
