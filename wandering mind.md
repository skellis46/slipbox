# wandering mind

_previous note:_ [[awareness-ing]]

---

The mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn has an app called _JKZ Meditations App_. In the Everyday Life Meditations section of the app there is a 30 minute _Lying Down Meditation_ and in it Kabat-Zinn says "if you have a mind it will wander."[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon] The simplicity and directness of this statement convey so much of the complexity of being human: that it is the nature of the mind to wander, and yet a wandering mind is also a source of consternation for us.
