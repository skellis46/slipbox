# poetic ecology

_previous note:_ [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]

> Ecology looks at how species and individuals relate in order to create new life. Poetic ecology looks at these relations from the perspective of subjectivity and meaning. So it’s not about cause and effect; instead, it’s about the expressiveness of a living reality whose creative process is constantly bringing forth a multitude of fertile relationships. In my view, any thinking in terms of relationship can only come about as a poetics. Any practice of aliveness can only be a poetic practice. A poetic ecology understands nature less as an economy of checks and balances than as the creative interpenetration of sentient beings, so it is animistic in that way.[Andreas Weber in @close-2022-poetics n.pag]

- 20221209 - am thinking here (but it's a stretch), that this might be a useful way of understanding ecology in how different practices intersect in [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]
- Weber [@weber-2019-enlivenment p.48] also talks about "poetic objectivity" and "poetic precision"
