a# interpretation remains present

_previous note:_ [[truth and beliefs]]

---

Jessica Riskin is a science historian and these ideas come from her review of _The Scientific Method: An Evolution of Thinking from Darwin to Dewey_ by Henry M. Cowles for the New York Review of Books. Whereas Cowles claims that the rise of the _scientific method_ -- and subsequent prescriptiveness -- was "less a success than a tragedy", Riskin describes it as a "feat of branding":[@riskin_just_2020 n.p.]

Part of this branding was the elimination of interpretation from science's brand of _the scientific method_:

>Interpretation remains present at every level. Everything we know is known by us; we can’t eliminate ourselves from the picture. Defining methods, choosing which ones to use, deciding how to use them, understanding what they produce: each of these acts is fundamentally interpretive.[@riskin_just_2020 n.p.]

Riskin goes on to quote Karl Popper ("scourge of relativism") from 1935:

>Out of uninterpreted sense-experiences science cannot be distilled, no matter how industriously we gather and sort them ... bold ideas, unjustified anticipations, and speculative thought, are our only means for interpreting nature: our only organon, our only instrument, for grasping her.

And then, in the interpretation of quantum mechanics she describes the thinking of Bohr and Heisenberg:

>Bohr reflected that any observation involves an interference with the thing observed. Our own acts of observation are a part of the world we see: we are “both onlookers and actors in the great drama of existence.” Heisenberg elaborated the idea by emphasizing that “what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning,” and that science was therefore “a part of the interplay between nature and ourselves.” Scientists in this period were recognizing the necessity of interpretation and putting that recognition to work in radical new ways that were neither humanistic nor scientific but integrally both. 


_questions & thoughts:_

- this is such a useful reminder as I keep attempting to tread the line between rationalism, relativism and empiricism
- there's some writing in [ellis-2013-dancing.pdf](hook://file/mmwNTYa8s?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=ellis-2013-dancing.pdf) that seems relevant:

>For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe anything but the perception ...(Hume 1896: Book I, Part 4, Section 6; cited in Dennett, 2003 p.101)

This quote by Hume has its own zettel: [[I never catch myself]]

- Heisenberg's thinking in final quote chimes beautifully with [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]] and to a certain extent [[mesearch]] (except that these often don't involve primary observation)

_consider:_

- Riskin also mentions the word _innovation_ in relation to creating industries in order to generate wealth: 

>Snow’s idea that engineers would solve the world’s problems specifically by not reading Shakespeare, i.e., by devoting themselves single-mindedly to inventing industries to generate wealth, has since become so commonplace that we express it in a single word: “Innovation.”

- [[heterotopic discourse and the truth]] -- the ways in which we push to understand
- [[epistemic rationality]]
- [[search for truth]]
- [[habitual ways of seeing]] -- that not only is their always interpretation, but also practices of new interpretations (or ways of seeing)
- [[literature notes/Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature]]
- [[preconceptions and the hermeneutic circle]]
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]
- [[first-person experience]]
- just noting overlap with Varela's introduction in Journal of Conciousness Studies:
>Indeed no methodological approach to experience is neutral, it inevitably introduces an interpretative framework into its gathering of phenomenal data. [@varela_first-person_1999 p.14]
