# saeculum

_previous note:_ [[we access time through objects or artifacts]]

> There’s an Etruscan word, _saeculum_, that describes the span of time lived by the oldest person present, sometimes calculated to be about a hundred years. In a looser sense, the word means the expanse of time during which something is in living memory. Every event has its saeculum, and then its sunset when the last person who fought in the Spanish Civil War or the last person who saw the last passenger pigeon is gone. To us, trees seemed to offer another kind of saeculum, a longer time scale and deeper continuity, giving shelter from our ephemerality the way that a tree might offer literal shelter under its boughs.[@solnit-2021-orwell n.pag]

- see also [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeculum) for background (and re word 'secular')

> The trees made the past seem within reach in a way nothing else could: here were living things that had been planted and tended by a living being who was gone, but the trees that had been alive in her lifetime were in ours and might be after we were gone. They changed the shape of time.[@solnit-2021-orwell n.pag]

> The trees were reminders of both our own ephemerality and their endurance long beyond ours, and in their uprightness they stood in the landscape like guardians and witnesses.[@solnit-2021-orwell n.pag]

> Trees are an invitation to think about time and to travel in it the way they do, by standing still and reaching out and down.[@solnit-2021-orwell n.pag]
