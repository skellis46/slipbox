# relationality and co-presence - objects are events based in virtual movement

_previous note:_ [[gaming chairs]]

> Opposing the rationality and dichotomous thinking undergirding Anglo-European philosophy that parcels reality into discrete objects and forms, such philosophy [he lists them in paragraph above on page 16] emphasizes relationality and co-presence, the creative “becoming” of life that can be constrained neither by social forces nor biopolitically driven theories of cognition and perception. All objects are events, based in “virtual movement.” Brian Massumi’s example is instructive: a chair is not just an object but a marker of temporality (“the feeling in this chair of past and future chairs ‘like’ it”); a connection to life forces (“the feeling in this chair that life goes on”); a presentation of its own relation “to the flow not of action but of life itself, its dynamic unfolding”; and a marker of relation and activity (“It’s how life feels when you see it can seat you”).44 [@burges-2016-introduction p.16]
