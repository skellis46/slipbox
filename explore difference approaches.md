# explore difference approaches

_previous note:_ [[seeing as exchange with the world]]


> As long as you’re exploring the same old approaches, Brian Eno explains, ‘you get more and more competent at dealing with that place, and your clichés become increasingly clichéd’.[@harford-2016-messy n.pag.]

Eno is really saying 'practice makes perfect' -- that we get 'good' at what we practice, including all the 'bad' habits. I have contrasted this with Noë and [[seeing as exchange with the world]] because of how he discusses organisational structures. Such structures seem to pre-determine the kinds of approaches we might take.
