## things edited out

That through our language we ride the line between what is demonstrably true and what is palpably untrue. 

Perhaps this is a case of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon – that thing that happens when you learn a word and then start seeing it everywhere – but my suspicion is that in JDSP the word _can_ is deployed as a hedge very often indeed.


> That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry. [@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

I'm curious about this phrase _epistemic credibility_. Without the kind of process that Ellerton describes then 

When asked how to minimise the impact of cognitive biases in human debate, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman said, "protect the dissenters" [@parrish-2020-daniel] by making dissent painless.

I have zero interest in the quantitative crudeness of citation indices: "Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's accurate. Or that it matters" [@godin-2023-song n.pag.]. The number of citations is not necessarily correlated to the quality or reliability of research; however it is a rough estimate of the influence of an article (whether positive or negative).

"Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, history and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out.

Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours." (Peter Ellerton, How Do You Know That What You Know Is True? That’s Epistemology)

"To review — yes, we come to beliefs before evidence, but we wish not only to express our beliefs but to be thought as reasonable. In some cases, we adopt beliefs considered reasonable by those around us. Sometimes we adopt those beliefs just to seem reasonable. When we adopt beliefs thought by some to be unreasonable, **we supply reasons**, often in the form of evidence. But far from being an afterthought, the evidence we supply is a necessary price we pay for the maintenance of our beliefs. If the reasonableness of a belief becomes too expensive or difficult to maintain, we lose the belief." (mikecaulfield, Reasonableness: An Introduction)

> The human understanding draws everything else to be in harmony with, and to support, those things which once please it, either because they are [generally] received and believed, or because they delight it. And, though it must be admitted that the force and the number of instances that occur to the contrary is greater, it [the understanding] either does not heed them or it disdains them; or, if it does take notice of them, it distances itself from them and dismisses them – and that not without great and pernicious prejudice – so that the authority of those previous beliefs remains inviolate.

Perhaps this patchwork phenomenon is a thing because somatics as an artistic-scholarly field is still fledgling? But is it still fledgling? When might we be ready enough to shed the _new_ label? I worry that we hide behind the _new_ label to rationalise this patchwork phenomenon I have observed and am describing. Thinking of ourselves as fledgling is perhaps how we get to say what we want without slowly building foundations of intra-disciplinary dialogue and debate. 


If practice x leads to effect y does it matter how, especially if the effect is due to the holistic nature of the practice: something ineffable, immeasurable or unfathomable? 


One of the most infamous articles of all time published in Lancet in 1998 by the ex-physician Andrew Wakefield et al (an article that has now been retracted) is ground zero for the anti-vaccination movement. That article has been cited 4299 times. Make that 4300 times. In other words, the number of citations is not necessarily strongly correlated to the quality or reliability of the research, although it is a rough estimate of the influence of an article (whether positive or negative).

I worked from both the beginning and the end of the journal so the articles most poorly represented by the beginnings of my analysis come from the middle years 2012 to 2018. 

, as if someday (in the distant future) these claims will be given the evidence they deserve or that we know to be right. Remember the brouhaha in our field about mirror neurons?  

There are exceptions: particularly in the earlier issues, and then later in articles for example by Nuding [-@nuding-2021-approaching] and Laidlaw [-@laidlaw-2021-ecological].

> Much work has been done to highlight pitfalls of the sociocultural framings that have shaped -- and continue to shape -- somatics discourse and practice (Ginot 2010; De Giorgi 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017; Fortin 2017; Eddy 2002; Green 2015). [@nuding-2021-approaching p.30]


I also introduced the randomisation as a result of not completing my analysis in time. And later, after a conversation with the dance philosopher Anna Pakes, it became clear that a more rigorous linguistic analysis of the JDSP corpus would be ideal to understand the nature of the language we use in the journal. But that's another presentation for another time. 

### Belief systems



Millman article here [@millman-2023-online] -- bloody fascinating



And it is likely human nature (and I suspect academics are particularly prone to this) that if we agree there is a concern or problem here, then none of us will think we are responsible for that  problem because we don't imagine we are making these kinds of claims.

> Knowingness, as the philosopher and psychoanalyst Jonathan Lear [defines](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674455344) it in *Open Minded* (1998), is a posture of always ‘already knowing’, of purporting to know the answers even before the question arises. -- in Jonathan Malesic

Somatics unlimited: this is a criticism of my position really. Because we are dealing with belief and beliefs are terrifically difficult to change. (all those cognitive biases exist to keep our visions of the world stable). Backfire effect. What would it take to change your position on the value of somatics? Then present that article JB sent me?

Propositional claims aren't bad perse. My question is more about the effects of having a journal in which the dominant method is to do something then believe something about it then claim it as a benefit. 

> In this version of reality, the idea that better information literacy or critical reasoning skills — of us, or the friends that listen to us — could lead to belief change is futile. The facts are merely window-dressing on deeper beliefs that must be addressed directly. <https://hapgood.us/2023/06/10/reasonableness-an-introduction/>

> In cases when the artist thinks they know, their interpretation may not be accurate or the whole story. We live in a mysterious world full of uncertainties. And we regularly make assumptions to explain them. Coming to terms with the complexity of our human experience allows us to exit our natural state of confusion. To survive. Generally our explanations are guesses. These vague hypotheticals become fixed in our minds as fact. We are interpretation machines, and this process of labeling and detaching is efficient but not accurate. We are the unreliable narrators of our own experience. [@rubin-2023-creative Location 1813]

> Clifford’s third and final argument as to why believing without evidence is morally wrong is that, in our capacity as communicators of belief, we have the moral responsibility not to pollute the well of collective knowledge. In Clifford’s time, the way in which our beliefs were woven into the ‘precious deposit’ of common knowledge was primarily through speech and writing. Because of this capacity to communicate, ‘our words, our phrases, our forms and processes and modes of thought’ become ‘common property’. Subverting this ‘heirloom’, as he called it, by adding false beliefs is immoral because everyone’s lives ultimately rely on this vital, shared resource. <https://aeon.co/ideas/believing-without-evidence-is-always-morally-wrong> -- this whole article is worth a look but really taken by idea of heirloom, the common property. the precious deposit.

- backfire effect vs confirmation bias: how do you respond to this?

- there's a bigger question about how we find things out. A question of method. how is it that we come to make this claim? methods are discipline specific. JDSP is full of many many kinds of methods: scientific interventions, ethnography, practice research, phenomenology, various qualitative practices (some with content analysis, some more akin to case studies) dance analysis, reflections, descriptions, various combinations of these. Many unstated. That is, it's not so clear how the writer got to say the things they are saying. Opinion. 

>To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag]

> One of the clearest ways to understand critical thinking is as applied epistemology. Issues such as the nature of logical [inference](https://www.thoughtco.com/inference-logic-term-1691165), why we should accept one line of reasoning over another, and how we understand the nature of evidence and its contribution to decision making, are all decidedly epistemic concerns.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

- "decidedly epistemic concerns" is a very useful term. These are the stakes and the more we enter an age of fake news, of filter bubbles (which large language models are only going to exacerbate) the more we become responsible for turning claims into arguments and building a stronger community of debate.

Primary claims, the patchwork of individual cells of research, and descriptions of practice not expressed in relation to other overlapping practices all point to a systemic epistemic problem in somatic practices research.  



It is barely believable from an insider's perspective, and one can only imagine how it might seem from the outside. 

## five provocations

### methods and superficiality


- where is place for the 'rational' in this conversation? 
- how might each of us justify the things we say? 

- most of these claims are not falsifiable -- but calling on that word (and the legacy of Karl Popper) is likely troubling in this context, or at the very least unfashionable. What do we have to do to the practices to make them accountable to methods that value falsifiability? (Popper's falsifiability principle or razor: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable. (wikipedia) -- but )
- these beliefs are sincere. We repeat them often. But sincerity and repetition are not the grounds by which we build an expansive understanding on the limits of somatic practices. 
- is there value in suspending belief? (and our convictions). What might scepticism be worth to our field? Is there risk there? 

How is this defensible? This position in somatics? 
The language of somatics is superficial. We have a superficiality problem. 

### ideology and beliefs

overdetermination: “occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect” — looking at definition of overdetermination -- it's like somatics is the opposite. A single thing responsible for every effect - but not clear what that single thing is. Certainly appears closer to underdeterminism: Evidence we have is not sufficient to know what to believe. Relates here more to biases -- that is, we already know what to believe, we are just making things fit into those belief systems. This is ideology.

> Consider again the nature of ideology, that necessary thing, which allows us to sort out the massive influx of information we experience. Could ideology also be a cognitive illusion, a kind of necessary fiction? [@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag.]

- Somatics as ideology. Making sense. See also earlier parts in book (Ministry for the future?) about ideology.
- beliefs


### claims of fact and claims of value

> Generally, there are three primary types of claims in an argument, also called persuasive claims:
>  Claims of fact assert that something is true or not true.
>  Claims of value assert that something is good or bad, or more or less desirable.
>  Claims of policy assert that one course of action is superior to another.[@nordquist-2020-what n.pag]

This is important. That without evidence we are just attempting to persuade or convince people. On what grounds might this convincing be happening? To become an argument any persuasive claim must be supported by evidence. 

In JDSP it is as if we are mixing up claims of fact with claims of value.

- stretch beyond individual (or atomised) claims ... what might our collective wisdom be (as a scholarly and artistic community) and on what grounds can we imagining rejecting a claim, or (at the very least) expressing doubt about it? 

Somatics: how do I disagree? How do we disagree if anything goes? use my viscious cycle of epistemology. Ginot does this ... who are the others?


-- but where and when are the debates happening?

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity

By the way, I assume that Martha Eddy's overview of somatic practices -- the very first article in the very first issue – is the most widely cited article from JDSP. This guess is based on two thoughts: 1) it's an overview of the field (review articles tend to be more highly in any field); and 2) I've seen it cited in science literature exploring mindful movement practices. Indeed, it has been cited 441 times (and that number will not include the translated versions published in JDSP in 2014) but perhaps there are other articles more widely cited. 

It is curious to read these writings and the sense of space they gave me which was entirely different from my feeling of insecurity and befuddlement while noticing claim after unsubstantiated claim. 

You might argue (fairly) that I even developed a bias to notice such claims and therefore drawing articles at random is a simple attempt to reduce my confirmation biases. 

### Motivated reasoning

Motivated reasoning overlaps Thinking about motivated reasoning (introduce it briefly -- example of female cigarette smokers?) --- but what other approaches might there be: cynical, caring, curiosity (approaches to how I understand my experience of reviewing these articles)

- emotive.

You might (rightly) question my values here or attempt to understand what might be in it for me. What are the motivations for my reasoning? I can say I am worried. I worry for what this pattern might mean for our field -- a field that I am indebted to, that is fundamental to my practice (as artist-scholar) and that deeply nourishes how I participate in the world. 

- noting that all these steps backwards take time and effort -- to discuss cherry picking, to talk about my motivations, to attempt to be transparent about the methods even for this simple analysis this morning. This effort is a low research bar, but it is also I think (or perhaps hope), rigorous -- a word that seems to have gone out of favour, at least in the disciplines in which I am most closely aligned. 


Early on in the journal. But in later volumes not at all. By far we are making primary claims. Almost total lack of mechanisms for these claims. That is, if we say somatics does this, then how does it do this? 

- Hetty: other fields similar to somatics? what about music (re making claims)

But other descriptions of practice go into claim mode ... - ones that are descriptive of process make fewer claims. Vital role -- in knowing. But rarely if ever (as I've written about elsewhere) talk about similar practices. Isolated bubbles.
- also how many are just sharing practice -- not a comment. These might make no claims at all (just describe it) all the way to overselling the hell out of it

- noting how differently I feel when no claims are made. Mostly I felt relief. That I am left to invest so differently (but also feel a little lost -- like watching art). How art (for the most part) doesn't make claims. 
- surprising number of simply descriptive accounts of practice. No claims. Refreshing. 

### The subjective to the general

> I think I was asking about whether you were recording claims about people's specific experiences (eg. My engagement with a somatic practice achieves…for me) or general claims (somatic practices/BMC/SRT etc achieves….). (Hetty Blades)
- my sense here is that the language makes the distinction tricky. There is slippage from the subjective to the general without acknowledging the shift. Give example.
- on what grounds do each of us get to say the things we say (Hetty's note about specific vs general is useful here). Examples of descriptions of practice are perhaps most intriguing. Make no claims but rather are sharing what work is happening.

- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness. 

What I did not cherry pick were examples that contradicted my observations. I sought them out. Exception proving rule? Or the possibility of another way? 

- somatics as anecdotal -- and Ginot's 2010 paper (Erin used the term anecdotal to describe part of Ginot's critique)
- intuitions -- and their value (see Annaka Harris in [[intuition]]

### Science and the body.

Third person perspective. 
First person perspective. Barrier? Boundary. 

> being a kind of passenger in the body. Appropriating the body from some position of subjectivity - Sam Harris talking to Jay Garfield 23 May 2022 15:33

- Barr and Anderson talk explicitly about link between science and somatics (in unproblematic way) and then how somatics extended beyond its association with science (p.11)
- Barr and Anderson: "However, when returning to Hanna’s definition of somatics in conjunction with such ideas, questions about unspoken implications and consequences surface (Green 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017)"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] -- worth looking at these and how unspoken they are?
- "Somatics is neither a monolith nor a panacea"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] 
- very useful re dance / science -- including citations

Linking here with Ingold's [[search for truth]] and the unison of imagination and experience, and of taking ourselves into the world. But how are we failing to do that in somatic practices? Contrast also with [[map and territory]] and my sense is that in the claims we are making we are attempting to construct the territory -- or to colonise the territory from a very small island (could give examples from those 'science' papers in JDSP (Batson et al is one?) which seem to be saying "you need to listen to us") 

> also refer to the validation methods of phenomenology and Buddhist practices saying it ‘[...] is derived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience and self-understanding’ (Varela et al. 1991: xix), a validation that also applies to somatic practices, given that it can only be measured from the observation of changes perceived by the individuals directly involved in the experience. [@silvagrebler-2020-reflection p.18]

- is this the issue -- "can only be measured"? But does that mean we get to say anything we want about it? 

Note a very early idea I had in [[zen, map and territory]] in which I describe [[authentic movement]] as a dance with territory or even noumenal experience ([[noumenon and phenomenon]]) -- really really not sure about this last bit. Noting also here the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and practices re 'knowing' the noumenon: [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^e2cbd2]] The Kantian thing seems to be about the un-naming (which is to know the unknowable 'thing in itself'). Non-dual awareness ticks into here -- that when there is no self, the unknowing ceases to be something that one's self can not do. 


(I would guess that as of now it is the journal I have read most in my scholarly life, perhaps along with IJSD and CHOR -- but then I've co-edited those journals) I think 

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity
-  leavened by occasional humility or caution: "sometimes overzealous and too narrowly optimistic stances towards somatics" (written as a counter to this)[@fortin-2017-looking p.146]
- could go through this one to group some claims together:

> The efficiency and benefits of applying somatic methods or practices to dance training have also been explored (Green 1999; Batson 2007; Eddy 2009).[@sen-podstawska-2022-moving p.52] 


Fortin (other examples and what they might tell us -- cf with the one above). So, although the Fortin article was selected at random I chose the following claim in my initial set of five to you today:

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

When I could have presented the following:

> Feldenkrais Method of somatic education allowed [them] to develop an internal authority which made them less vulnerable to the health impacts of the dominant dance discourse. [@fortin-2009-experience p.60]

I have some issues with Fortin's methods, but at least this statement is grounded in evidence gained through an action-research process (working with undergraduate dance students). 


- ain't nothing wrong with claims -- it's more the type/kind that I think is worth discussing (or is it my perception of the quantity?)


[[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

I think by using the word _claim_ I've shown my hand more than a little. The word implies that I have adopted suspicious eyes. I did not, for instance, attempt to catalogue the arguments or _facts_ in JDSP, and it's important to remember that there are arguments in its pages, as there are facts. 

> Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky-2012-skill n.pag.]

> In this frame, dance relies on a high degree of specialised and high contact-based training that culminates in performances or financially expensive presentations in specialised venues [...] dance in this context becomes an elite activity within an ecology of 'refined' culture that claims to be rooted in the identity formation of everyday life and, yet, services relatively small sections of the community. (Phillips 2004: 1)  -- [Phillips in @laidlaw-2021-ecological p.97]

- this article by Laidlaw is very good


In 1997 the somatics philosopher Elizabeth Behnke wrote: 

> somatics is a field that is still in the process of creating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of its history, and searching out an appropriate language for its theory and practice [Behnke, 1997 (p.667) in @barr-2022-illuminating p.17] 

Ah, but that was more than 25 years ago I hear you say ...
