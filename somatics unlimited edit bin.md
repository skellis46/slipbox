## original abstract

A proposal to attend the Somatic Practices Conference, July 2023

> There is a real situation, that can't be denied, but it is too big for any individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and this is a good thing. 

-- Kim Stanley Robinson [-@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free [@eddy-2009-briefa p.6], greater physical expression [@batson-2007-revisiting], physical harmony [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259], challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse [@beaudry-2015-somatic], "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" [@fortin-2017-looking p.146], and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]. In this presentation I will map and organise the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. I will then use this map to examine i) _interoception_ as an example of the failure of somatic practices in the arts and humanities to work with scientific discourses and laboratories; and ii) the nature of ideology itself and its value and limitations in helping us understand the role and limits of somatic practices. The presentation will address two themes from the call for proposals: what has been missing in explorations of somatics, and the pressing questions for somatics in the future.

## updated abstract (actually used this one)

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free (Eddy 2009), greater physical expression (Batson 2007), physical harmony (Mullan 2014), challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse (Beaudry 2015), "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" (Fortin 2017), and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" (Kampe 2015). In this presentation I discuss the nature of the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices, and what these claims might say about our responsibilities within and beyond dance research.

## edit bin

That through our language we ride the line between what is demonstrably true and what is palpably untrue. 

Perhaps this is a case of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon – that thing that happens when you learn a word and then start seeing it everywhere – but my suspicion is that in JDSP the word _can_ is deployed as a hedge very often indeed.

(the claim is assumed or does not cite previous scholarship)

This number excludes editorials, reports, book reviews and volume 14.1S, but includes interviews and editorials for special issues. 

> That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry. [@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

I'm curious about this phrase _epistemic credibility_. Without the kind of process that Ellerton describes then 

When asked how to minimise the impact of cognitive biases in human debate, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman said, "protect the dissenters" [@parrish-2020-daniel] by making dissent painless.

I have zero interest in the quantitative crudeness of citation indices: "Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's accurate. Or that it matters" [@godin-2023-song n.pag.]. The number of citations is not necessarily correlated to the quality or reliability of research; however it is a rough estimate of the influence of an article (whether positive or negative).

"Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, history and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out.

Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours." (Peter Ellerton, How Do You Know That What You Know Is True? That’s Epistemology)

"To review — yes, we come to beliefs before evidence, but we wish not only to express our beliefs but to be thought as reasonable. In some cases, we adopt beliefs considered reasonable by those around us. Sometimes we adopt those beliefs just to seem reasonable. When we adopt beliefs thought by some to be unreasonable, **we supply reasons**, often in the form of evidence. But far from being an afterthought, the evidence we supply is a necessary price we pay for the maintenance of our beliefs. If the reasonableness of a belief becomes too expensive or difficult to maintain, we lose the belief." (mikecaulfield, Reasonableness: An Introduction)

> The human understanding draws everything else to be in harmony with, and to support, those things which once please it, either because they are [generally] received and believed, or because they delight it. And, though it must be admitted that the force and the number of instances that occur to the contrary is greater, it [the understanding] either does not heed them or it disdains them; or, if it does take notice of them, it distances itself from them and dismisses them – and that not without great and pernicious prejudice – so that the authority of those previous beliefs remains inviolate.

>"**6.** In the *Pensées* , Pascal observed that “there are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason.” With regard to language, we might say that there are two analogous extremes: to exclude the possibility that language can adequately express something truthful about the world, to admit only the truths language can convey. I would assent to the claim that there are truths beyond language. There are inexpressible realities and ineffable experiences. But language is itself a miracle and a gift of extraordinary range, power, and beauty. It is one thing to reach the limits of language by testing its resources and searching its depths, and another thing altogether to mistake our own apathy and incuriosity for the inherent limits of speech." (The Convivial Society, Too Many Words, and Not Enough)

Human beings are cherry pickers. We seek and notice examples that confirm our beliefs or ideas and don't notice or ignore examples that contradict these beliefs. Such confirmation biases are not conscious. For example, goal-oriented motivated reasoning is driven by personal emotions. That is, the heuristic for judging new information is, more or less: how does this information make me feel? 

In this presentation I have tried to mitigate against cherry picking. I did this by randomly selecting 20 articles from the full 272 and then worked my way down that list of 20 articles to include as examples in this presentation. 

Perhaps this patchwork phenomenon is a thing because somatics as an artistic-scholarly field is still fledgling? But is it still fledgling? When might we be ready enough to shed the _new_ label? I worry that we hide behind the _new_ label to rationalise this patchwork phenomenon I have observed and am describing. Thinking of ourselves as fledgling is perhaps how we get to say what we want without slowly building foundations of intra-disciplinary dialogue and debate. 


A philosophical razor is a rule of thumb designed to shave off unlikely explanations of phenomena; a time-saving device. Hitchens' epistemological razor is designed to reject certain knowledge claims. It was created by and named after renowned journalist and atheist Christopher Hitchens: 

> What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. [@hitchens-2007-god p.258]

Hitchens was using the razor in the context of refuting religious belief, but what it does more broadly is put the burden of proof on the person making the claim. For example, if I claim that somatic practices improve physical coordination, then it is my responsibility to try and provide the evidence to build that argument.

I think it matters because if we have no understanding of the mechanisms of change then we cannot say which part of a practice is responsible for the changes we seem to be seeing and describing. It's a monumental question.

If practice x leads to effect y does it matter how, especially if the effect is due to the holistic nature of the practice: something ineffable, immeasurable or unfathomable? 

I sought out these examples (rather than relying on drawing them out randomly) as they contradicted my hunch about claim-making in JDSP.

Just to be clear: Both of these articles are remarkable and I have enormous respect for the authors ... and I sure have missed Andrée in these last difficult years. 

Once again, this is not to shame or somehow condemn these works. I found them all to be compelling, fascinating and beautifully written.

If we look at citation patterns for articles in JDSP it starts to make the patchwork picture of primary claims very stark indeed. Now, I have zero interest in the quantitative crudeness of citation indices: "Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's accurate. Or that it matters" [@godin-2023-song n.pag.].

One of the most infamous articles of all time published in Lancet in 1998 by the ex-physician Andrew Wakefield et al (an article that has now been retracted) is ground zero for the anti-vaccination movement. That article has been cited 4299 times. Make that 4300 times. In other words, the number of citations is not necessarily strongly correlated to the quality or reliability of the research, although it is a rough estimate of the influence of an article (whether positive or negative).

Cherry picking -- a form of confirmation bias -- is also known as the fallacy of incomplete evidence, and in science it is an epistemological characteristic of denialism. 

I worked from both the beginning and the end of the journal so the articles most poorly represented by the beginnings of my analysis come from the middle years 2012 to 2018. 

, as if someday (in the distant future) these claims will be given the evidence they deserve or that we know to be right. Remember the brouhaha in our field about mirror neurons?  

Could we agree that this patchwork phenomena in JDSP is a thing? We don't have to agree on whether it is a good or bad thing. But that it exists. 

There are exceptions: particularly in the earlier issues, and then later in articles for example by Nuding [-@nuding-2021-approaching] and Laidlaw [-@laidlaw-2021-ecological].

I also introduced the randomisation as a result of not completing my analysis in time. And later, after a conversation with the dance philosopher Anna Pakes, it became clear that a more rigorous linguistic analysis of the JDSP corpus would be ideal to understand the nature of the language we use in the journal. But that's another presentation for another time. 

### Belief systems

Underpinning any epistemic system are our beliefs. However ... 

> arguments that threaten our core beliefs and our sense of belonging to a group (e.g., political beliefs) typically trigger all kinds of motivated reasoning (Taber & Lodge 2006; Kahan 2017) whereby one outright rejects those arguments without properly engaging with their content.[@novaes-2021-argument n.pag]

What would it take to change your position on the value of somatics? Then present that article JB sent me?

Millman article here [@millman-2023-online] -- bloody fascinating

> arguments that threaten our core beliefs and our sense of belonging to a group (e.g., political beliefs) typically trigger all kinds of motivated reasoning (Taber & Lodge 2006; Kahan 2017) whereby one outright rejects those arguments without properly engaging with their content. Relatedly, when choosing among a vast supply of options, people tend to gravitate towards content and sources that confirm their existing opinions, thus giving rise to so-called “echo chambers” and “epistemic bubbles” (Nguyen 2020).<https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/argument/#Fall>

- Ellerton article for The Conversation re epistemology and truth is useful. https://read.readwise.io/new/read/01gyhnwb6edbv3zxwh6j4wx4p4 -- very very good as overview of some suggestions I might make. 

> The sincerity of one’s belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to “believe me” should not be rationally persuasive by themselves.[@ellerton-2017-how]

And it is likely human nature (and I suspect academics are particularly prone to this) that if we agree there is a concern or problem here, then none of us will think we are responsible for that  problem because we don't imagine we are making these kinds of claims.

> Knowingness, as the philosopher and psychoanalyst Jonathan Lear [defines](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674455344) it in *Open Minded* (1998), is a posture of always ‘already knowing’, of purporting to know the answers even before the question arises. -- in Jonathan Malesic

Somatics unlimited: this is a criticism of my position really. Because we are dealing with belief and beliefs are terrifically difficult to change. (all those cognitive biases exist to keep our visions of the world stable). Backfire effect. What would it take to change your position on the value of somatics? Then present that article JB sent me?

Propositional claims aren't bad perse. My question is more about the effects of having a journal in which the dominant method is to do something then believe something about it then claim it as a benefit. 

> In this version of reality, the idea that better information literacy or critical reasoning skills — of us, or the friends that listen to us — could lead to belief change is futile. The facts are merely window-dressing on deeper beliefs that must be addressed directly. <https://hapgood.us/2023/06/10/reasonableness-an-introduction/>

> In cases when the artist thinks they know, their interpretation may not be accurate or the whole story. We live in a mysterious world full of uncertainties. And we regularly make assumptions to explain them. Coming to terms with the complexity of our human experience allows us to exit our natural state of confusion. To survive. Generally our explanations are guesses. These vague hypotheticals become fixed in our minds as fact. We are interpretation machines, and this process of labeling and detaching is efficient but not accurate. We are the unreliable narrators of our own experience. [@rubin-2023-creative Location 1813]

> Clifford’s third and final argument as to why believing without evidence is morally wrong is that, in our capacity as communicators of belief, we have the moral responsibility not to pollute the well of collective knowledge. In Clifford’s time, the way in which our beliefs were woven into the ‘precious deposit’ of common knowledge was primarily through speech and writing. Because of this capacity to communicate, ‘our words, our phrases, our forms and processes and modes of thought’ become ‘common property’. Subverting this ‘heirloom’, as he called it, by adding false beliefs is immoral because everyone’s lives ultimately rely on this vital, shared resource. <https://aeon.co/ideas/believing-without-evidence-is-always-morally-wrong> -- this whole article is worth a look but really taken by idea of heirloom, the common property. the precious deposit.

- backfire effect vs confirmation bias: how do you respond to this?


- there's a bigger question about how we find things out. A question of method. how is it that we come to make this claim? methods are discipline specific. JDSP is full of many many kinds of methods: scientific interventions, ethnography, practice research, phenomenology, various qualitative practices (some with content analysis, some more akin to case studies) dance analysis, reflections, descriptions, various combinations of these. Many unstated. That is, it's not so clear how the writer got to say the things they are saying. Opinion. 

>To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag]

> One of the clearest ways to understand critical thinking is as applied epistemology. Issues such as the nature of logical [inference](https://www.thoughtco.com/inference-logic-term-1691165), why we should accept one line of reasoning over another, and how we understand the nature of evidence and its contribution to decision making, are all decidedly epistemic concerns.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

- "decidedly epistemic concerns" is a very useful term. These are the stakes and the more we enter an age of fake news, of filter bubbles (which large language models are only going to exacerbate) the more we become responsible for turning claims into arguments and building a stronger community of debate.

Primary claims, the patchwork of individual cells of research, and descriptions of practice not expressed in relation to other overlapping practices all point to a systemic epistemic problem in somatic practices research.  

Alfred North Whitehead warned that a corollary of abstraction is an effect he called _explaining away_ [Whitehead, in @mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49]. When we treat abstractions as something concrete "everything that does not fit into the schema is denied the status of proper existence" [@mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49] -- it is explained away. Abstractions make invisible anything that does not fit our model of the world. Yet even in a delightful celebration of the lowly or perhaps fundamental plié the epistemic stakes get very high very quickly.

It is barely believable from an insider's perspective, and one can only imagine how it might seem from the outside. 

## five provocations

### methods and superficiality

- there's a bigger question about how we find things out. A question of method. how is it that we come to make this claim? methods are discipline specific. JDSP is full of many many kinds of methods: scientific interventions, ethnography, practice research, phenomenology, various qualitative practices (some with content analysis, some more akin to case studies) dance analysis, reflections, descriptions, various combinations of these. Many unstated. That is, it's not so clear how the writer got to say the things they are saying. Opinion. 
- where is place for the 'rational' in this conversation? 
- how might each of us justify the things we say? 

- most of these claims are not falsifiable -- but calling on that word (and the legacy of Karl Popper) is likely troubling in this context, or at the very least unfashionable. What do we have to do to the practices to make them accountable to methods that value falsifiability? (Popper's falsifiability principle or razor: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable. (wikipedia) -- but )
- these beliefs are sincere. We repeat them often. But sincerity and repetition are not the grounds by which we build an expansive understanding on the limits of somatic practices. 
- is there value in suspending belief? (and our convictions). What might scepticism be worth to our field? Is there risk there? 

How is this defensible? This position in somatics? 
Language is superficial. We have a superficiality problem. 

### ideology and beliefs

overdetermination: “occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect” — looking at definition of overdetermination -- it's like somatics is the opposite. A single thing responsible for every effect - but not clear what that single thing is. Certainly appears closer to underdeterminism: Evidence we have is not sufficient to know what to believe. Relates here more to biases -- that is, we already know what to believe, we are just making things fit into those belief systems. This is ideology.

> Consider again the nature of ideology, that necessary thing, which allows us to sort out the massive influx of information we experience. Could ideology also be a cognitive illusion, a kind of necessary fiction? [@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag.]

- from Ministry for the future.
- Somatics as ideology. Making sense. See also earlier parts in book (Ministry for the future?) about ideology.
- beliefs

> The sincerity of one’s belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to “believe me” should not be rationally persuasive by themselves.[@ellerton-2017-how]


Also _Argumentation as an epistemic practice_ -- relates to Nordquist above (but compare with confirmation bias, and the backfire effect! -- motivated reasoning):

> In particular, arguments that threaten our core beliefs and our sense of belonging to a group (e.g., political beliefs) typically trigger all kinds of motivated reasoning (Taber & Lodge 2006; Kahan 2017) whereby one outright rejects those arguments without properly engaging with their content. Relatedly, when choosing among a vast supply of options, people tend to gravitate towards content and sources that confirm their existing opinions, thus giving rise to so-called “echo chambers” and “epistemic bubbles” (Nguyen 2020). Furthermore, some arguments can be deceptively convincing in that they look valid but are not (Tindale 2007; see entry on [fallacies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fallacies/)). Because most of us are arguably not very good at spotting fallacious arguments, especially if they are arguments that lend support to the beliefs we already hold, engaging in argumentation may in fact _decrease_ the accuracy of our beliefs by persuading us of false conclusions with incorrect arguments (Fantl 2018). <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/argument/#Fall>

They become truisms. A word like that? 

- seems like these are closer to the level of myths or beliefs. Even hopes, wishes or desires. 

Thinking through Ginot's statement that the purpose of science in somatics is to "foster belief" [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#^fd4fbc]]. 

### claims of fact and claims of value

> Generally, there are three primary types of claims in an argument, also called persuasive claims:
>  Claims of fact assert that something is true or not true.
>  Claims of value assert that something is good or bad, or more or less desirable.
>  Claims of policy assert that one course of action is superior to another.[@nordquist-2020-what n.pag]

This is important. That without evidence we are just attempting to persuade or convince people. On what grounds might this convincing be happening? To become an argument any persuasive claim must be supported by evidence. 

In JDSP it is as if we are mixing up claims of fact with claims of value.

- stretch beyond individual (or atomised) claims ... what might our collective wisdom be (as a scholarly and artistic community) and on what grounds can we imagining rejecting a claim, or (at the very least) expressing doubt about it? 

Somatics: how do I disagree? How do we disagree if anything goes? use my viscious cycle of epistemology. Ginot does this ... who are the others?


-- but where and when are the debates happening?

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity

By the way, I assume that Martha Eddy's overview of somatic practices -- the very first article in the very first issue – is the most widely cited article from JDSP. This guess is based on two thoughts: 1) it's an overview of the field (review articles tend to be more highly in any field); and 2) I've seen it cited in science literature exploring mindful movement practices. Indeed, it has been cited 441 times (and that number will not include the translated versions published in JDSP in 2014) but perhaps there are other articles more widely cited. 

It is curious to read these writings and the sense of space they gave me which was entirely different from my feeling of insecurity and befuddlement while noticing claim after unsubstantiated claim. 

You might argue (fairly) that I even developed a bias to notice such claims and therefore drawing articles at random is a simple attempt to reduce my confirmation biases. 

### Motivated reasoning

Motivated reasoning overlaps Thinking about motivated reasoning (introduce it briefly -- example of female cigarette smokers?) --- but what other approaches might there be: cynical, caring, curiosity (approaches to how I understand my experience of reviewing these articles)

- emotive.

You might (rightly) question my values here or attempt to understand what might be in it for me. What are the motivations for my reasoning? I can say I am worried. I worry for what this pattern might mean for our field -- a field that I am indebted to, that is fundamental to my practice (as artist-scholar) and that deeply nourishes how I participate in the world. 

- noting that all these steps backwards take time and effort -- to discuss cherry picking, to talk about my motivations, to attempt to be transparent about the methods even for this simple analysis this morning. This effort is a low research bar, but it is also I think (or perhaps hope), rigorous -- a word that seems to have gone out of favour, at least in the disciplines in which I am most closely aligned. 

The eighteenth-century French philosopher Voltaire wrote simply:

> Define your terms ... or we shall never understand one another.[@mitchell-2019-artificial loc 286]



- surprising just how little 2º there was -- my hunch was about Anna Pakes' idea

Early on in the journal. But in later volumes not at all. By far we are making primary claims. Almost total lack of mechanisms for these claims. That is, if we say somatics does this, then how does it do this? 

in that it made no reference to research or scholarship by other people.
- by primary source I mean a claim that is uncited. Sometimes the citation is assumed (as if it's a matter of (uncontestable) fact)
- by primary I mean a claim that is not attributed OR has come from the research being presented (vast % is simply an opinion in fact's clothing)

- Hetty: other fields similar to somatics? what about music (re making claims)

from Wright example above: I say "simply by chance" because it was rare -- I estimate less than a quarter of the articles I reviewed -- for articles to include the mechanisms by which the somatic practices functioned.

But other descriptions of practice go into claim mode ... - ones that are descriptive of process make fewer claims. Vital role -- in knowing. But rarely if ever (as I've written about elsewhere) talk about similar practices. Isolated bubbles.
- also how many are just sharing practice -- not a comment. These might make no claims at all (just describe it) all the way to overselling the hell out of it

- noting how differently I feel when no claims are made. Mostly I felt relief. That I am left to invest so differently (but also feel a little lost -- like watching art). How art (for the most part) doesn't make claims. 
- surprising number of simply descriptive accounts of practice. No claims. Refreshing. 

### The subjective to the general

> I think I was asking about whether you were recording claims about people's specific experiences (eg. My engagement with a somatic practice achieves…for me) or general claims (somatic practices/BMC/SRT etc achieves….). (Hetty Blades)
- my sense here is that the language makes the distinction tricky. There is slippage from the subjective to the general without acknowledging the shift. Give example.
- on what grounds do each of us get to say the things we say (Hetty's note about specific vs general is useful here). Examples of descriptions of practice are perhaps most intriguing. Make no claims but rather are sharing what work is happening.


- see also  re abstractions: "denied the status of proper existence":

> In a similar way, the operations of AI depend on datafication: the presentation of the world as data separated out from the continuity of experience. Unfortunately, one corollary of abstraction is the effect that philosopher of science Alfred North Whitehead criticized as ‘explaining away’: by treating abstractions as something concrete, everything that does not fit into the schema is denied the status of proper existence (Whitehead, 1997). The error comes from treating abstractions as more real than phenomena. This kind of reified abstraction is a key mechanism of instrumental rationalities like AI – the trick that allows it to see only that which can be made useful and ignore the rest.[@mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49]


- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness. 

What I did not cherry pick were examples that contradicted my observations. I sought them out. Exception proving rule? Or the possibility of another way? 

although I have drawn examples at random from the entire pool of JDSP articles.

This list is arbitrary really. I pulled the claims from five different articles; the very first five articles I selected at random from the 271 articles that have been published in JDSP since 2009 (up to volume 14.2 in 2022). 

- somatics as anecdotal -- and Ginot's 2010 paper (Erin used the term anecdotal to describe part of Ginot's critique)
- intuitions -- and their value (see Annaka Harris in the edit bin)


### perception of change / change of perception

- what does it mean to be good at somatics? How do we recognise someone who is 'good' at somatics? It's a funny/silly/old question/joke about somatics, but so much of what we can't and can say about somatics rests on the capacity to understand and communicate what it is we are observing/noticing (in ourselves and in others) when doing somatics well. See in [[Zoran Josipovic - Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain#^448a09]] and also note the Varela reference in that blockquote.
- [[measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices]] -- see note re perception of change / change of perception

I am not the first to do this. Isabelle Ginot's remarkable piece of scholarship in Dance Research in 2010

> An intuition is simply the powerful sense that something is true without our having an awareness or an understanding of the reasons behind this feeling - Annaka Harris (useful word to keep in mind)

### Science and the body.

Third person perspective. 
First person perspective. Barrier? Boundary. 

> being a kind of passenger in the body. Appropriating the body from some position of subjectivity - Sam Harris talking to Jay Garfield 23 May 2022 15:33

- Olivia Barry mentions interoception: 
> Rooted in movement and sensory perception, somatics explore the body to accrue interoceptive understanding and homeostatic awareness of the process of embodiment.[@barry-2022-tracing p.253]
- this sentence makes zero sense. what is the 'process of embodiment'?

- Barr and Anderson talk explicitly about link between science and somatics (in unproblematic way) and then how somatics extended beyond its association with science (p.11)
- Barr and Anderson: "However, when returning to Hanna’s definition of somatics in conjunction with such ideas, questions about unspoken implications and consequences surface (Green 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017)"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] -- worth looking at these and how unspoken they are?
- "Somatics is neither a monolith nor a panacea"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] 
- very useful re dance / science -- including citations

Linking here with Ingold's [[search for truth]] and the unison of imagination and experience, and of taking ourselves into the world. But how are we failing to do that in somatic practices? Contrast also with [[map and territory]] and my sense is that in the claims we are making we are attempting to construct the territory -- or to colonise the territory from a very small island (could give examples from those 'science' papers in JDSP (Batson et al is one?) which seem to be saying "you need to listen to us") 

> also refer to the validation methods of phenomenology and Buddhist practices saying it ‘[...] is derived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience and self-understanding’ (Varela et al. 1991: xix), a validation that also applies to somatic practices, given that it can only be measured from the observation of changes perceived by the individuals directly involved in the experience. [@silvagrebler-2020-reflection p.18]

- is this the issue -- "can only be measured"? But does that mean we get to say anything we want about it? 

Note a very early idea I had in [[zen, map and territory]] in which I describe [[authentic movement]] as a dance with territory or even noumenal experience ([[noumenon and phenomenon]]) -- really really not sure about this last bit. Noting also here the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and practices re 'knowing' the noumenon: [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^e2cbd2]] The Kantian thing seems to be about the un-naming (which is to know the unknowable 'thing in itself'). Non-dual awareness ticks into here -- that when there is no self, the unknowing ceases to be something that one's self can not do. 


In 2010, the dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner, Isabelle Ginot wrote a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. The article is called _From Shusterman’s Somaesthetics to a Radical Epistemology of Somatics_ [@ginot-2010-shusterman] and in it Ginot asks some difficult questions of somatic practices. _adjust this paragraph to focus on epistemological critique of Ginot's._ withering critique in the role of science to validate the "highly individualized"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15] experiences of somatic practices. 

It is the most sustained and well argued critique of somatic practices scholarship I have happened across (although also enjoyed Elise Nuding in Volume 13 of JDSP)

- dig deeper into the kinds of claims I was looking for -- need clarity here -- see Hetty's comments



(I would guess that as of now it is the journal I have read most in my scholarly life, perhaps along with IJSD and CHOR -- but then I've co-edited those journals) I think 

There is a philosophical razor -- and a razor is a rule of thumb designed to shave off unlikely explanations of phenomena; a time-saving device. Actually, it's an epistemological razor designed as a rule for rejecting certain knowledge claims. This razor is called Hitchens' razor, created by and named after renowned journalist and aetheist Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens' epistemological razor is this: 

> what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. [@hitchens-2007-god p.258]

Hitchens was using the razor in the context of refuting religious belief, but more broadly, what it does is place the burden of proof on the person making the claim. For example, if I claim that somatic practices improves coordination, then it is my responsibility to provide the evidence to make that argument. This is clear: 


- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity

- - useful summary at beginning of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] -- describes pedagogic, better (more virtuosic) dancing, injury prevention and rehab
-  leavened by occasional humility or caution: "sometimes overzealous and too narrowly optimistic stances towards somatics" (written as a counter to this)[@fortin-2017-looking p.146]

- could go through this one to group some claims together:
> The efficiency and benefits of applying somatic methods or practices to dance training have also been explored (Green 1999; Batson 2007; Eddy 2009).[@sen-podstawska-2022-moving p.52] 

- can say what most number of claims was in single article
- percentage of 1º vs 2º

Fortin (other examples and what they might tell us -- cf with the one above). So, although the Fortin article was selected at random I chose the following claim in my initial set of five to you today:

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

When I could have presented the following:

> Feldenkrais Method of somatic education allowed [them] to develop an internal authority which made them less vulnerable to the health impacts of the dominant dance discourse. [@fortin-2009-experience p.60]

I have some issues with Fortin's methods, but at least this statement is grounded in evidence gained through an action-research process (working with undergraduate dance students). 

- title "somatics unlimited" was based on a hunch. method is fragile because of this hunch. confirmation bias. to guard against it (if that's even possible)

- ain't nothing wrong with claims -- it's more the type/kind that I think is worth discussing (or is it my perception of the quantity?)

It is an extraordinary list even if perhaps it's also a little unfair on my part to pluck them out of context and put them next to each other like this:

[[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

I think by using the word _claim_ I've shown my hand more than a little. The word implies that I have adopted suspicious eyes. I did not, for instance, attempt to catalogue the arguments or _facts_ in JDSP, and it's important to remember that there are arguments in its pages, as there are facts. For example, of the five I have just shown you, the one by Sylie Fortin is more than a claim. Here it is again: 

> Feldenkrais Method of somatic education allowed [them] to develop an internal authority which made them less vulnerable to the health impacts of the dominant dance discourse. [@fortin-2009-experience p.60]

> Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky-2012-skill n.pag.]

> In this frame, dance relies on a high degree of specialised and high contact-based training that culminates in performances or financially expensive presentations in specialised venues [...] dance in this context becomes an elite activity within an ecology of 'refined' culture that claims to be rooted in the identity formation of everyday life and, yet, services relatively small sections of the community. (Phillips 2004: 1)  -- [Phillips in @laidlaw-2021-ecological p.97]

- this article by Laidlaw is very good

> Phenomenology, first established by Edmund Husserl, studies consciousness and its embodied processes (Husserl [1900] 1970). Its teachings hold that features of experience appear and transform in consciousness. [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]

- mentions non dual awareness and Dogen Zen [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]


## getting going: a schism and creating a disciplinary identity

In 1994 I started full-time dance training at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne. I was 25 years old. At the same time I was completing a Masters Degree in Kinesiology (mostly Newtonian mechanics) at the University of Otago School of Physical Education in Otago, Aotearoa New Zealand. At the VCA I was given credit for BA-level classes that were called Kinesiology. Yay. I didn't have to go to those classes. It didn't occur to anyone (including me) that there was practically zero cross-over between the Kinesiology I had been studying for 6 years and the Kinesiology that was being taught at the VCA. I tell this story not to establish any scientific credentials on my part. Far from it. Rather, I tell it as an example of the cultural schism between science and art. Ah, but that was nearly 30 years ago I hear you say ... 

In 1997 the somatics philosopher Elizabeth Behnke wrote: 

> somatics is a field that is still in the process of creating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of its history, and searching out an appropriate language for its theory and practice [Behnke, 1997 (p.667) in @barr-2022-illuminating p.17] 

Ah, but that was more than 25 years ago I hear you say ...
