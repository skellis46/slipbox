# standpoint epistemology

_previous note:_ [[mesearch]]

_Capitalism Is A Standpoint Epistemology_ is a blog post by philosopher Matthew McKeever. He introduces the thinking of capitalism theorist FA Hayek, and in particular the idea that capitalist economies function through both scientific knowledge, and what McKeever calls "particular knowledge".[@mckeever_capitalism_2018 n.p.] This more _local_ kind of knowledge depends on particularities of time and space and he argues that it is akin to standpoint theory or epistemology. McKeever's point is to suggest that capitalism and standpoint theory are at least in part built on partial and situated understandings. They are both "bottom-up" epistemologies, "placing emphasis on the particulars of peopleâ€™s experience as opposed to the generalities of scientific knowledge".[@mckeever_capitalism_2018 n.p.]  


_questions & thoughts:_

- he introduces the Lindsay, Boghossian, and Pluckrose _Academic Grievance Studies_ hoax (which I'd forgotten about): [[grievance studies]]
- Alison Wylie quote at very beginning of the post is very useful:

>Standpoint theory poses a challenge to any assumption that the neutrality of epistemic agents ... is either a necessary or a sufficient condition for the knowledge claims they produce. ... considerable epistemic advantage may accrue to those who approach inquiry from an interested standpoint, even a standpoint of overtly political engagement.

See also [wylie-2015-standpoint.pdf](hook://file/osjSLO2hy?p=c2tlbGxpcy9Eb3dubG9hZHM=&n=wylie-2015-standpoint.pdf) which I found while looking for Wylie (2003).

- need to look at relationship between standpoint theory and critical constructivist perspectives of understanding/knowing. Certainly the hoax writing -- <https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/02/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/> is a fun way to start
- there's a line though I think: between the frustrations and (justified) skepticism of the hoax writings, and the idea that we bear no influence on the data we interpret: [[interpretation remains present]] (and the Popper quote in there). In that note I mention that it seems like I'm adopting a centrist (or perhaps _hybrid_?) epistemic position.

_consider:_

- [[art practices explicitly become epistemic things]]
- [[epistemic rationality]]
- [[epignosis and participating in knowing]]
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]] - sedimented experience
- [[truth and beliefs]]
- [[myside bias]]
- [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]]
