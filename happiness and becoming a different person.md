# happiness and becoming a different person

_previous note:_ [[keeping our stories about who we are]]

Dear

Here's a brief video of a [ruru](https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/birds/birds-a-z/morepork-ruru/) or morepork shot by my brother outside his house in Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand. The raggedy feather hanging off its back is a joy:

But this small piece of writing is about happiness. I don't think it has anything to do with art or choreography ... or ruru.

Jon Kabat-Zinn is a curious human being. He has a PhD in molecular biology from MIT (1971) and a beautiful warm voice (not from MIT). Perhaps he is best known for deploying meditation techniques within the Western medical tradition. His _Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)_ course works with Buddhist practices but in a scientific context. In other words, Kabat-Zinn has attempted to separate mindfulness practices from any religious origins or connections. Nevertheless, in his writing and talking he seems far away from _[mcmindfulness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/straight-talk/201406/mcmindfulness)_, even though he could be accused of being somewhat responsible for making mindfulness practices more digestible by consumer-capitalist economics. 

In 2009, Kabat-Zinn [was interviewed on Krista Tippett's podcast](https://onbeing.org/programs/jon-kabat-zinn-opening-to-our-lives) called _On Being._ It's a wide-ranging conversation (and well worth a listen), and at one point Kabat-Zinn explores the nature of the scientific name we humans have given ourselves: _Homo sapiens sapiens_. 

Hilariously, and perhaps not surprisingly, H.s. sapiens is the only ["widely accepted"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens) sub-species of H.sapiens. Normal practice is to create a sub-species only when there is more than one. But, as a species (and sub-species), we human beings don't tend to shy away from hubris. 

In outlining the Latin etymology of _sapien_ (from sapere: to taste, to know), Kabat-Zinn beautifully describes humans as "the species that knows and knows that it knows." He urges us to live up to our name by cultivating awareness and recognising how such cultivation might make us happy:

> And that’s not some kind of prescription for more stuff that you need to do in order to be happy. This is getting out of your own way long enough to realize that you already have the potential for tremendous well-being and happiness right here, right now. Nothing else has to change. 

John Tarrant is the director of the Pacific Zen Institute, and the author of a book called _Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans That Will Save Your Life_. The title makes me think of those books that sit right next to the check-out counter at a bookshop around Christmas time. Tarrant's perspective seems different from Kabat-Zinn's when it comes to happiness. Tarrant's is a perspective more mired in the difficulty and even danger of changing who we are:

> Everyone thinks that they want happiness, but they might not. They might rather keep their stories about who they are and about what is impossible. Happiness is not an add-on to what you already are; it requires you to become a different person from the one who set off seeking it.[@tarrant-2008-bring Introduction n.pag.]

I don't mind the differing attitudes or perspectives of Kabat-Zinn and Tarrant but they do make me curious about which of the two I am drawn to. Perhaps such things are matters of taste, disposition or personality. 

And then there's Bruce Springsteen ... who does not have a PhD from MIT, is not the director of the Pacific Zen Institute, and is not talking about happiness. On 15 March 2012 Springsteen gave a remarkable [keynote speech at South By Southwest](https://www.npr.org/2012/03/16/148778665/bruce-springsteens-sxsw-2012-keynote-speech?t=1606310285599) in Austin, Texas. It's worth every second of your time. Right towards the end, he says this:

> Don’t take yourself too seriously, and take yourself as seriously as death itself. Don’t worry. Worry your ass off. Have ironclad confidence, but doubt — it keeps you awake and alert. Believe you are the baddest ass in town, and, you suck! It keeps you honest. It keeps you honest. Be able to keep two completely contradictory ideas alive and well inside your heart and head at all times. If it doesn’t drive you crazy, it will make you strong.

I imagine Springsteen is pleading with me – with us – to keep possibilities open; to be mesmerised by ambivalence, in which "our bodies [are] swept up by forces beyond our calculated clutches on reality."[@bosler-2022-where p.99]

Even just the thought makes me happy.
