# happiness and becoming a different person

_previous note:_ [[keeping our stories about who we are]]

Dear

This is a small bit of writing about happiness. I'm not quite sure why I am writing to you about happiness but I hope it brings you some pleasure.

Jon Kabat-Zinn is a curious human being. He has a beautiful warm voice and a PhD in molecular biology from MIT (1971). Perhaps though he is best known for deploying meditation techniques within the Western medical tradition. His _Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)_ course works with Buddhist practices but in a scientific context. In other words, he has attempted to separate mindfulness practices from any religious origins or connections.

In 2009, Kabat-Zinn [was interviewed on Krista Tippett's podcast](https://onbeing.org/programs/jon-kabat-zinn-opening-to-our-lives) called _On Being._ It's a wide-ranging conversation (and well worth a listen) but I'd like to focus on one small part when Kabat-Zinn explores the nature of the scientific name we humans have given ourselves: _homo sapien sapiens_. Hilariously, and perhaps not surprisingly, only sub-species. (build from here: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens)

There's a rather strange little book by John Tarrant called _Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans That Will Save Your Life_.  

Tarrant's perspective in [[keeping our stories about who we are]] seems quite different from Kabat-Zinn's:

> And thatâ€™s not some kind of prescription for more stuff that you need to do in order to be happy. This is getting out of your own way long enough to realize that you already have the potential for tremendous well-being and happiness right here, right now. Nothing else has to change. (from [[the species that knows and knows that it knows]])
