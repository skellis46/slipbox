# happiness and becoming a different person

_previous note:_ [[keeping our stories about who we are]]

Dear

This small piece of writing is about happiness. I don't think it has anything to do with art or choreography.

Jon Kabat-Zinn is a curious human being. He has a beautifully warm voice and a PhD in molecular biology from MIT (1971). Perhaps though he is best known for deploying meditation techniques within the Western medical tradition. His _Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)_ course works with Buddhist practices but in a scientific context. In other words, Kabat-Zinn has attempted to separate mindfulness practices from any religious origins or connections. Nevertheless, in his writing and talking he seems far away from [mcmindfulness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/straight-talk/201406/mcmindfulness), even though he could be accused of being somewhat responsibly for making mindfulness practices more digestible by consumer capitalist economics. 

In 2009, Kabat-Zinn [was interviewed on Krista Tippett's podcast](https://onbeing.org/programs/jon-kabat-zinn-opening-to-our-lives) called _On Being._ It's a wide-ranging conversation (and well worth a listen), and at one point Kabat-Zinn explores the nature of the scientific name we humans have given ourselves: _Homo sapiens sapiens_. 

Hilariously, and perhaps not surprisingly, H.s. sapiens is the only ["widely accepted"](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens) sub-species of H.sapiens. Normal practice is to create a sub-species only when there is more than one. But, as a species (and sub-species), we don't tend to shy away from hubris. 

In outlining the Latin etymology of sapien (from sapere: to taste, to know), Kabat-Zinn describes humans rather beautifully as "the species that knows and knows that it knows." He urges us to live up to our name by cultivating awareness and recognising how such cultivation might make us happy:

> And thatâ€™s not some kind of prescription for more stuff that you need to do in order to be happy. This is getting out of your own way long enough to realize that you already have the potential for tremendous well-being and happiness right here, right now. Nothing else has to change. 

There's a rather strange little book by John Tarrant called _Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans That Will Save Your Life_. It strikes me as one of those books that sits right next to the check-out counter at a book shop around Christmas time. Tarrant's perspective seems different from Kabat-Zinn's when it comes to happiness, a perspective more mired in the difficulty and even danger of changing who we are:

> Everyone thinks that they want happiness, but they might not. They might rather keep their stories about who they are and about what is impossible. Happiness is not an add-on to what you already are; it requires you to become a different person from the one who set off seeking it.[@tarrant-2008-bring Introduction n.pag.]

I don't really mind the differing attitudes or perspectives of Kabat-Zinn and Tarrant but they do make me curious about which of the two I am drawn to. -- matter of taste. ??

something about being mesmerised: p.99 of Dark Mountain? [[to be mesmerised is to be transfixed]]
or Toni Morrison's 'do beauty' from p.158 of DM V 21?
or Victor Frankl on suffering from p.197 of DM v21?
or ecology of self and self-awareness p.200 of DM and quote here in [[Fox - A Self-awareness of Water]] - going beyond happiness
or Salami's view from mountain in [[Lawson and Salami - The other side of the mountain]]?
