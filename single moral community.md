# single moral community

_previous note:_ [[wokeness and myth]]

Here Alan Jacobs builds on his own thinking about the [[mythical vs technological core of culture]] and [[wokeness and myth]]. He draws on the writing of Emile Durkheim (1858–1917), and in particular _The Division of Labor in Society_ (1893).

In Durkheim's _The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life_ (1912) he writes that a religion "is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and surrounded by prohibitions — beliefs and practices that unite its adherence in a single moral community"[Durkheim, in @jacobs-2020-paradoxical n.pag.]

For Durkheim (as described by Jacobs) this single moral community as an institution -- or collective consciousness -- is a church, although not limited to churches in the conventional sense of the word. Such churches are "always concerned with the work that beliefs and practices do to achieve and consolidate social solidarity"[@jacobs-2020-paradoxical n.pag.]
