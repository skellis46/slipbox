# theory of the gimmick

_previous note:_ [[dances enframed by software]]

In _TikTok, Friendship, and Sipping Tea, or How to Endure a Pandemic_ Melissa Blanco Borelli and madison moore describe how TikTok is a "rich, neoliberally activated virtual stage that moves across pleasure, politics, and personality"[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.299]. They call on Sianne Ngai's _Theory of the Gimmick_ and how Ngai describes a gimmick -- including TikTok's key lip-syncing function -- as a "flagrantly unworthy, yet still perversely attractive thing."[@brazil-2020-interview n.pag.] Ngai writes that a gimmick is "both a wonder _and_ a trick. It is a form we marvel at _and_ distrust, admire _and_ disdain, whose affective intensity for us increases precisely because of this ambivalence."[@ngai-2017-theory p.469 original emphasis]

_thoughts & links:_

_This note is about Blanco Borelli and madison moore's thinking:_ Intensity increases because of the ambivalence? Really? How do they know this? Like it's doing something transgressive? Like stealing a cigarette to have a smoke on schoolgrounds? And what critical frames are they talking about? I imagine if capitalism had a face it would smile deeply at these claims for increased affective intensity: "I have you right where I want you and your affective intensity". We are suckers.
