# we find our song and remember it and sing it

_previous note:_ [[an artist confronts their experiential world by means of a craft]]

> There is a difference between singing under some eucalyptus trees at a river crossing in the Northern Territory, and being on the stage at the Sydney Opera House, but we can’t say that the difference is always in favor of the Sydney Opera House. What makes a human life real and beautiful is available in every place. An insubstantial and alienated life—eating a hearty breakfast of a cardboard photo of corn flakes—is always on offer but its consolations are not consoling. In order to embrace a handmade life, you do have to be willing to deal with the Minmin lights along with awe and fear. But you have to deal with awe and fear anyway, and when you pay attention, a continual turning toward the genuine just happens.

> We can’t say that human lives have a purpose, since a purpose would be smaller than we are. It’s true though, that the impulse to give freely to the world seems to be at the bottom of the well of human intentions where the purest and clearest water arises. To be able to offer back what the world has given you, but shaped a little by your touch—that makes a true life. Eventually we find our song and remember it and sing it. And we can never know who else will sing the song, or how the story will turn out in the end; its ripples widen beyond us and there is no end in sight.[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 15 The Master Song Man: An Australian Koan -- Finding Your Song n.pag.]
