# silence orphans us from certainty 

_previous note:_[[alive or dead? I'm not saying]]

> Silence is frightening, an intimation of the end, the graveyard of fixed identities. Real silence puts any present understanding to shame; orphans us from certainty; leads us beyond the well-known and accepted reality and confronts us with the unknown and previously unacceptable conversation about to break in upon our lives.[@whyte-2019-consolations p.156]



There are various connections in this slipbox to do with uncertainty; e.g.: 
- [[negative capability]] and being with uncertainty
- [[doubt and blind faith]]
- [[service of the self]]
- [[not knowing and surprise]]
- [[not knowing is a creative possibility]]
- [[negative capability]]

But few to do with silence:

- [[Whyte - The Three Marriages]]
- [[Sennett - Together#^a8c717]]
