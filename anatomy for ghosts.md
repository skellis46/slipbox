# anatomy for ghosts

Dear 

In September of 2012 my dear friends (and former colleagues) Bob Whalley and Lee Miller sent me a request in the form of a letter. I'm _publishing_ this here (with their permission) as I thought their questions (and my responses) might intrigue you. Their letter said this:  

> Simon  ...

> As someone who has taught me a lot about anatomy, I'd like to ask you a few questions about how anatomy 'haunts' you. You can answer the questions (or not) in any way you wish. As you might know, Lee and I feel like we have only just found our bodies; we've only just found what connects the toe bone to the foot bone.

> Through medical imagery and texts, and listening to the instruction and expertise of those around us, we are trying to map our understanding of the workings of the body, whilst acknowledging our limitations and where we might be missing vital information.

> The 'ghosts' are those things we have not been able to pin down; the things that are left adrift, and we realise that we need help from those who have taught us anything/something/everything about anatomy, and would very much like to ask you the following:

My response cut in before the first question:

These three questions are inextricably bound together in my experience of moving my body. Even this term *moving my body* generates questions for me about agency (who am I to move my body?), attachment (what if this body is not mine to know?) and crisis (this body is not the same one as yesterday, and certainly not the same one -- at a cellular level -- as, say, 20 years ago (except perhaps for the cells of my brain). It is *my* brain isn't it?)).

> Question 1: What gaps do you have in your knowledge of anatomy?

But you want to know about gaps. Not identity. 

I don't know any neural anatomy anymore. I used to. I don't really know the origins and insertions of muscle groups anymore. I don't know what nerves supply these muscles anymore. I don't know the anatomy of the shoulder anymore. As for my organs, I only really know their names these days. There is a theme here. I used to know these things.

The gaps have become lacunae. Like a form of dementia. I know they are within me. Somewhere. But I can only just connect the bits I do know. The gaps between are too large. Thigh bone connected to the hip bone. It's a bit frightening, but I also, perhaps, feel more safe.

But what I don't know is replaced by an increased awareness of principles: stability and instability, strength and flexibility, the anatomy of my body in the world, tone/tension and relaxation, sensitivity to change, suggestability (open to suggestions in various contexts), sensation and attention -- to be able to scan the whole body, to zoom in and notice affect, to shift rapidly between orientations.

But the gaps are kind of simple: back of my knees, the space between my lats and my ribs, the alignment of the pelvis, the spaces between my toes and fingers, behind my ears. But even in naming them my attention is drawn to those areas and I can listen.

> Question 2. What has been your formative experience of learning anatomy?

My knowledge of anatomy has two quite distinct phases. 

The first is of the body as a machine -- an earthen machine -- in which the various parts are isolated, studied and then reconstituted. It is the body as musculoskeletal system, the body as organs, the body as vestibular system, the body as cardiovascular system, the body as hormonal system. It is the body as discrete packages. It is detail, and anatomical specificity. It is rigorous and *true*. It is positivist truth. It is sitting in anatomy 101 (seriously) lectures listening to the person who knew (an Australian) tell us what she knew so that we might know too. It is my fascination with muscular effort, and levers, and moment arms, and inertia, and momentum. It is the biomechanical body. It is a machine that breaks. It is a fallable machine. It is a limited machine. It is wanting to be thoroughly used up when I die. I'm starting to want to use these texts for performance. It is a beautiful machine, but a machine nevertheless.

The second is of the body as sensation. It is about dance training. It is about how dance and somatic training invite listening and understanding at a much deeper level. What is deeper? It is the whole body, and none of it. God I hope you didn't want really plain answers. It is about noticing within, and inviting the possibility that my body is in constant transition. It is homeless. It is the training of the body's senses and sensors. Kinesthetics. Proprioception. But these are part of the body as machine.  

It is a Nancy Stark-Smith exercise in which as I roll, ever so slowly, I become aware of my organs accommodating each other. 

Perhaps I no longer care about the gaps, and more important is the tuning and sensitisation of the body (note the definite article there) to possibility. This is particularly important as the age of my body becomes important. And by important, I mean, obvious. 

> Question 3. In what ways, if any, does anatomy haunt you?

In the morning, my body stutters. I trust that it will return, but for a long time it is as if it is simply a collection of injuries. Some old. Some relatively new. The degree to which I *know* to push or stop is perhaps the most difficult part of how I have come to know my anatomy, my body. My sports training has instilled a deep desire to push very hard, to extract all of my body's capacity, to test its limits, to begin to understand and even see its edges. My somatic training is (rather simply) about listening, and not necessarily succumbing to the desire to go go go.

It is true to say that I would like a young body again. Yes, I appreciate what is happening, and how *newness* is available to me as I age, but the lure of even a single day without pain is strong.

Perhaps the most significant of my injuries -- those which haunt me -- ankles, feet, knees (particularly left), both hips (from a project in which I was bound by rope and then charged until the rope *snapped* me backwards), right shoulder, neck (from compressed forced flexion -- someone jumping on me whilst my neck was in flexion -- whilst rehearsing a trio) is my spine. 

It has been hurting for 25 years now. It is part of my identity. Recently (in 2008) it got very bad, and I had trouble walking comfortably for longer than about 5 minutes. I was haunted by loss. Loss of potential, loss of youth, loss of mobility, loss of freedom. I think it was an angry ghost. I went to see a sports psyschologist (Â£300+ per session). She asked me to imagine doing the simplest of dance movements -- a roll-down, or spinal roll -- without pain. Just to imagine it without pain. I couldn't do this. Even in my mind's eye this ghost was present. I was looking at myself -- perhaps 10 metres away -- trying to do the archetypal contemporary dance movement and it was if he/I had had a part of his anatomy removed. Excised. Cut. Abandoned. I got to a particular sensation (or amount of flexion) -- still just imagining this -- and my spine disappeared. Oblivion. This was horrifying. I cried walking home. My anatomy didn't seem to be mine.

And yet, bodies change. They recover. They are resilient. They are, above all, patient with time. They continue, steadfastly, adapting, changing, living. And gradually, every so gradually, I have learned to imagine a whole body to be in. A whole body to move with. Perhaps not first thing in the mornings though. But a capable, rich, dancing body nevertheless. 

My ghosts are just that for now. Watching over me. Reminding me of my vulnerability. Checks and balances. 

It is not a machine for living, it is this gently motile, adapting, breathing collection of parts, presents and futures.

Thanks for reading.
