# weathering the weather

_previous note:_ [[the self and the person]]

Whether the weather be fine,  
Or whether the weather be not,  
Whether the weather be cold,  
Or whether the weather be hot.  
We'll weather the weather,  
Whatever the weather,  
Whether we like it or not!

- Tongue Twister

I spent the weekend in East Devon in a workshop with the movement artist [Helen Poynor](http://www.walkoflife.co.uk/helen.htm). Each day the work involved different preparatory movement work in a small community hall before we went onto two different sites to practice. On Saturday at an Iron Age hillfort called [Blackbury Camp](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/blackbury-camp/) and on Sunday along the tidal area under the cliffs down from [Beer Beach](https://www.visitsouthdevon.co.uk/things-to-do/beer-beach-p640103) where the cormorants are busy building their nests along those same cliffs. 

Once on site, we are given simple scores to follow that involve being in these environments for an uncertain amount of time. Instructions include “stay at animal height” or “sprawl with part of your body contacting a rock and another part the pebbles” or “move, then rest in presence, then move”. These scores are a guide, and their simplicity and clarity belies the the transformative complexity of being on and in these sites while weathering the weather. 

Many of my Kiwi friends are deeply connected to being outside: to leaving the comfort of their homes with a pack, to being able to locate themselves with a compass, to spending long days on their legs, to knowing deep in their bones what it is to be close to nature, to be in weather. When I think of these friends in those spaces, I feel moved by their skill, courage, and volition, and I want to be clear that what we we were doing with Helen Poynor in Devon is not at all the same as what my friends in Aotearoa do regularly. But they were on my mind while curled up in my tent attempting to stay warm and wondering if yet one more layer would sort out why my butt was so damn cold.

> The idea that we’re outside the world looking in, deciding from a menu which choice to make, is precisely the dangerous illusion. 

– Timothy B. Morton [^1] 

I have a sneaky suspicion that Morton’s idea is at the heart of the transformation I experienced (and have experienced before) while working outdoors on site with Helen. In the time of the practice, it is as if my sense of subjecthood – of being an “I” outside or separate to the environment – starts to dissolve or even become meaningless. The feeling in those direct and extended experiences of being with dirt and rock and ocean and tree is of widening time and consciousness underpinned by profound humility. There is awe here in the diminishing scale of the self: it’s beautiful and discombobulating. It is O for awesome (if you’re a Kiwi of a certain age you’ll know the reference).

Here’s Jay Garfield describing selflessness:

> In order to get our minds around the experience of selflessness, it is useful to recall the deep connection between the sense of self, the understanding of experience in terms of subject-object duality, and of action in terms of free agency. To take ourselves to be selves [...] is to take ourselves to be subjects with a very different mode of existence than that we assign to our objects. It is to regard ourselves as standing *against* the world rather than as being embedded *in* it. And it is to take our self-knowledge to be immediate, as opposed to the mediated knowledge we have of our objects.[^2]

Putting aside the fact (sheepishly) that up until now I have never thought of the word _mediated_ in opposition to immediate, Garfield knocks it out of the park re human exploitation of the planet. The planet’s resources are available to exploit if and only if they are treated as objects separate from human subject-hood. This is the danger that Morton is referring to above and it is why I think Poynor’s work matters deeply. It is not because of what it might do _for_ me (or whomever is engaged in the practice) but that it undermines _me-ness_. There is a deep softening of the outside site-as-object and as a matter of direct experience (even if fleetingly) “I” becomes site. It is the difference (as a grammatical trick which removes the “I”) between “I dance the site” and “the site being danced”.

One final thought. I suspect part of what affords these kinds of experiences is that they are not oriented towards a goal. I am not trying to reach the top of a mountain, or visit an old statue. You can get a sense of how rare such non-goal-directed experiences are for human beings when asking WordDB (the database of words) what the top five opposite words for goal-directed are: aimless, disorganised, haphazard, random and unplanned. There are other rippers: drifting, rudderless, vagabond, vagrant, wandering, pointless, desultory and purposeless. I think pointless or purposeless are pretty accurate but they are words that depend on their roots: in order for something to be purposeless there must be something that has a purpose.

At a stretch we might say such activities have intrinsic value. But that’s not the same at all. The value of these activities (intrinsic or otherwise) is a by-product of them not being oriented towards a goal or achieving something. 

Out of curiosity, I wonder when was the last time you did something that was not goal-directed and in which you did not want anything in particular from the experience?
