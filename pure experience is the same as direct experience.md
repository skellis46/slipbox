# pure experience is the same as direct experience

_previous note:_ 

> A philosophical approach that dealt extensively with the issues of experience and emptiness is that by Kitarō Nishida. Influenced by the work of William James (Friedl 2001), Nishida defined pure experience (Japanese: *junsui keiken* 純粋経験) right at the beginning of his early work *Inquiry into the good* as “the state of experience just as it is without the least addition of deliberative discrimination. The moment of seeing a color or hearing a sound, for example, is prior not only to the thought that the color or sound is the activity of an external object or that one is sensing it, but also to the judgment of what the color or sound might be. In this regard, pure experience is identical with direct experience. When one directly experiences one’s own state of consciousness, there is not yet a subject or an object, and knowing and its object are completely unified” (Nishida 1911/1990, p. 3). As Feenberg and Arisaka (1990) discuss, this definition needs to be interpreted as an ontological principle rather than a concrete mental state. Nishida’s philosophy is grounded in the Buddhist principle of absolute or true emptiness, where pure experience precedes the distinction between subject and object.[@krageloh-2019-phenomenological p.21]
