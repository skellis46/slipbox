# artistic research and traceability

_previous note:_ 

> Traditional academic protocol leaves little room for the variety and subtlety of other forms of argumentation, but everywhere we look, an increasing amount of research is being shared through visual means â€“ and this research is implemented just as rigorously as any scientific experiment, and is every bit as clear in its argumentation. [@vis-2021-research p.7 V1.0]

In V1.1 (p.8) uses the word 'traceability' instead of argumentation at the end of the sentence.
Indeed, the Introduction is quite different in 1.1.
