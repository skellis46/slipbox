# human industrial economy

>The “human industrial economy” is Kingsnorth’s term for technopoly conceived in relation to the whole of the natural order.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.28]

>Any action which hinders the advance of the human industrial economy is an ethical action, provided it does not harm life.
    
 >Any action which knowingly and needlessly advances the human industrial economy is an unethical action.

(both of these from Kingsnorth, but cited in Jacobs p.28)
