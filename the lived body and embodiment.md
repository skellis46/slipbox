# the lived body and embodiment

_previous note:_ [[interoception science overview]]

> In this regard, Husserl (1989), Merleau-Ponty (1962), Straus (1963, 1966), and many others have explored a conception of embodiment that differs from that conventionally presented within modern science. The “lived body,” that is, the body as both experiencer and experienced, is not just an object in the world like any other. It is that by which we have an experienced world (life-world) to begin with. As I sit here in my chair, the scene I apprehend is organized around my corporeal position: my cup of tea to the left, my computer mouse to the right, ceiling above, and so on. Husserl calls the body a “null-point” (1989) like the zero point on a graph, around which is organized our up and down, front and back, above and below, left and right. [@leder-2019-insights p.307]
