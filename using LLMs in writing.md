# using LLMs in writing

_previous note:_ [[AI-generated art]]

> But the potential of these AI-powered automatic writers goes beyond journalistic parlor tricks. They promise to serve as new tools for the creation of art. One of the most remarkable pieces of writing I read this year was Vauhini Vara’s essay “[Ghosts](https://substack.com/redirect/298a22a7-ea02-4673-8c40-807a391ba0d6?j=eyJ1IjoiMzJreDZ3In0.gaTwpODLkXCFxBmcH8GsZZJtOqKjq3MZQebvlplFPMU)” in *The Believer*. While locked down in 2020, Vara became obsessed with GPT-3. “I sought out examples of GPT-3’s work, and they astonished me,” she writes in an introduction to her piece. “Some of them could easily be mistaken for texts written by a human hand. In others, the language was weird, off-kilter — but often poetically so, almost truer than writing any human would produce.” Yeats would have understood.
