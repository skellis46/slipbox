# shiver dance

Recently I have been a participant in a science experiment that has something to do with cold water, shivering and appetite. And so last week I spent 30 minutes submerged up to my neck in a rather cheap looking paddling pool that was filled with water cooled down to 16ºC. At that temperature, water is definitely cold but it's mostly tolerable, at least for 30 minutes. When I got in the pool, dressed in my speedos and with a heart rate monitor and some kind of tightly fitting mask, I started shivering immediately. 

Shivering is a strange experience, but prolonged shivering is stranger still. It feels both voluntary and involuntary. I seemed to be able to relax or soften my body to allow waves of shivering to pass, but then it would kick back in again. A lot of the time it was pretty much full body shivering ... bordering on convulsions. The conditions meant it was not possible to forget my body.

Mostly we forget our bodies. They are like ghosts we carry around with us and only appear (or are summoned by our physiology and biochemistry) when we need to change something (feeling hungry, having a full bladder), if something is not quite right (acute pain, stumbling or falling), or if something is right (having consensual sex). But, generally speaking, our bodies fade into the background. They are the forgettable part of us that is merely a container for being a self that is lost in thought. 

Here are psychiatrists Thomas Fuchs and Jann Schlimme: 

> Normally, the body tends to efface itself in our world-directed activity. However, it appears as an object of conscious attention, particularly when it is inadequate for a task to be performed, be it by a lack of capacity, fatigue, illness or numbness, and whenever it becomes an object for others to whom I feel exposed. In these cases, the body’s performance is made explicit and may often be disturbed. Thus, the body has a double or ambiguous experiential status: both as a ‘lived body’, implicit in one’s ongoing experience, and as an explicit, physical or objective body. An ongoing oscillation between these two bodily modes constitutes a ﬂuid and hardly noticed foundation of all experiencing.[^1]

While shivering in that paddling pool I could not _not_ be witness to my body explicitly attempting to stay alive. It seemed to be doing what it had to in order to sustain its core temperature and I (whoever "I" is at this stage) was merely along for the ride. 

Dancing is akin to voluntary shivering. It is when our bodies are foregrounded and our sense of self disappears as it collapses or migrates from a subject that can have a body to simply being a body. Dancing -- and I mean all kinds of dancing here -- remembers the body. The dancing body helps us taste what it is like to be more than a self that is almost always lost in thought. 

And just in case this is all too much, here's YouTuber Ed People asking people to teach him their favourite dance moves:

- do not have an experience but we are created by experiential flow [[Krägeloh - Phenomenological Research Fails to Capture the Experience of Nondual Awareness]] (p.22)
Perhaps that is what dancing is or does. 

Dancing is not an experience we have, rather it is a means by which we create ourselves through experiential flow. There are many many other ways to do this (running, mountain climbing, gardening, playing chess, coding software, cooking) and clearly not all require that we remember our bodies. But one thing that dance does do is make draw


My thoughts here are not to make a case that dance is special. Rather, it is to acknowledge that 
Dancing is a means to notice the intimate connection between self and body

- practice of dancing -- I'd suggest it's a third state
