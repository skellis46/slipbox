# dark ecology

_previous note:_ [[movement from epistemology to cosmology]]

---

> Although life on earth may cease to exist as a result of the warming atmospheric system, the planet will continue long after we have gone (McKenzie and Reihana 2019; Marsden 2003). Timothy Morton explores the ‘strange uncanny’ of this through his concept of a ‘dark ecology’ and is a critical guide to the Anthropocene. Writing under Northern skies, however, his work is counterpointed by indigenous performance scholarship from the deep South where gestures that cut the wind are continuous with cosmological thinking from Te Ao Māori (a Māori world-view), resisting Western conceptions of mortality and the physical and divine limits of the human.[@brown-2020-hau p.77]

_thoughts & links:_

- go deeper into Morton (Morton (2013) _Hyperobjects: Philosophy and ecology after the end of the world_)
- relates to so much of [[Krznaric - The Good Ancestor]] and the sense of resting with (or conceptualising) mortality. Explored this in [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
