# the weather lands in our bodies

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> How the weather lands in our bodies through breathing with cultural systems of apprehension, understanding, intuiting, sensitizing and knowing facilitated a reclaiming of connection to the sky as Tāwhirimātea, and to atmospheres that breathed right through us. Living on a planet in distress, we resisted the corrosiveness of capitalism and colonialism, reaffirming the Hau, the breath of life.[@brown-2020-hau p.74]


_thoughts & links:_

- just more beautiful writing, particularly in how they shift from the smallness of the weather in the body and how it expands outwards to the world. This was a key theme of [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
- but also super useful for [[nature, art and habitat proposal]] and this sense of the weather landing in our bodies
