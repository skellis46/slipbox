# the map is not the territory

_previous note:_ [[map and territory]]

---

This is a wiki-based entry on the rationalist site _Lesswrong_ that provides an overview on a key idea or principle of rationalist ideology. It suggests that the phrase _the map is not the territory_ was coined by [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski) (which the wikipedia site confirms). Note the difference in Yudowsky's description from a piece of fiction here: ![[map and territory#^77c985]]

>Reality exists outside our mind but we can construct models of this 'territory' based on what we glimpse through our senses.

The entry contains two useful ideas:

- Scribbling on the map does not change the territory
- The map is a separate object from the territory and the map exists as an object inside the territory

This second point is described as follows:

>The analogy encourages us to look from a frame of reference other than from the inside outward and hopefully realize that not only do we cause things to happen, and things cause other things to happen, but also things have caused us to be the way we are.[@noauthor_map_2009 n.pag.]

_thoughts & links:_

- I suspect I need to read more about the basis (and ideology) or rationalism, but I'm curious about this simple formulation and how it might be used to disentangle some of the mangle of [[art practice and artistic research]].
- in particular the idea that changing our beliefs does not change the world and how this might be useful in considering a creative practice in the context of #practice-research. (Of course changing our beliefs _might_ change the world, but in the context of practice-research I imagine this is not the case. The question then becomes what are we noticing that is different and why is that important and to whom?) 
- this practice of noticing tempers wishful thinking (or, plainly, hope) in practice-research
