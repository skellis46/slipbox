# an object of special regard

_previous note:_ [[whole physical body minus the brain]]

Dear

I remember a newspaper interview (probably from the 1990s) with a choreographer who said that they were interested in the body. It struck me at the time as being self-evident; surely it would have been more interesting to talk with a choreographer who was _not_ interested in the body. 

Human bodies are strange and fascinating things in part because (at least in the English language) we describe ourselves as _having_ a body. But when I say, for instance, "I have a body", who is the _I_ in that statement that _has_ a body and how is the _I_ distinguishable from that body?   

The philosopher and sociologist Helmuth Plessner (building on the work of phenomenologist Edmund Husserl) described the double nature of human embodiment. That is, "we both _are_ a body and _have_ a body" [@wehrle-2020-being p.499].  Plessner wrote, “[A] human being always and conjointly is a living body and has this living body as his [sic] physical thing” [Plessner 1970, in @wehrle-2020-being p.500]. In other words, the human body is a subject _and_ an object. (I could spin off here into an unruly tangent about [[nonduality]] but that's for another time). 

What is more, our sense of self -- of being a self -- is deeply connected to the body. The neuroscientist Anil Seth writes it like this:

> The essence of selfhood is [...] a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body [@seth-2021-being location 150].

In dance, we reify the term _embodiment_. We talk about embodied knowledge, embodied intelligence, embodied actions and even embodied movement (which another phenomenologist Maxine Sheets-Johnstone describes as an ignorant tautology [@sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.4]). I think though that when we in dance talk about embodiment, we tend to mean the whole physical body minus the brain; that is, we cleave the brain from the body [@goldman-2009-social p.154]. I suspect also that dance researchers oscillate between talking about the body as subject and the body as object without necessarily meaning to, and without acknowledging the distinction made so clearly by Plessner. In doing so, and by overusing the word embodiment, the body becomes an "object of special regard" [@garfield-2022-losing n.pag.], and even the body as subject will show up as yet another object [Jake Orthwein, in @taft-2023-few 18:17min]. 

This is all rather dense for a mini-essay and it is really supposed to be only a pre-amble. But for what it's worth I tend to think of embodiment (or being embodied) as more or less what we are doing when we are not lost in thought (and we are, suffice to say, lost in thought most of the time; it's not called the **Default** Mode Network for nothing). 

If it's not yet clear, being and having a body matter to me and I like to imagine that they matter to you as well. For the last nearly two years I've been collecting short statements from people that respond to the question, "What is your body to you?" (See how tricky it gets with language? -- that there's a _body_ and a _you_). The statements all start with two words: This body. Below is a very small selection of the collection. 

This body is aging. This body makes things possible. This body is constantly reinventing itself. This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies. This body knows how to walk, run and dance. This body is not like the others. This body feels. This body grows. This body changes. This body is wounded. This body is bruised. This body sees and is seen. This body is a chameleon. This body has buried the bodies of others. This body adapts. This body has been exploited. This body cannot be known. This body will die. This body touches the earth. This body has a birthmark. This body is no longer the same. This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard". This body is at a loss. This body is enveloped by skin. This body is riddled with uncertainty. This body shares. This body houses these feelings. This body is consciousness and self-knowing. This body cannot escape technology. This body is unknown and cannot be known. This body is bleeding. This body has bled. This body was abused. This body marks the planet. This body is technological. This body is broken. This body is a time-traveler. This body is overwhelmed by detail. This body is the place through which experiences flood. This body is where I need to go. This body belongs to this mind. This body trusts you. This body consumes resources. This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory. This body is in pain. This body has no boundary. This body has betrayed me. This body is worthy of trust. This body is mine. This body walks. This body is always reinventing itself. This body is not far from death and I am not afraid. This body humbles me over and over again. This body takes pleasure. This body plays. This body is untouchable. This body participates.

I don't yet know what I will do with them all. I could imagine them printed on 4x6" cards and installed on the wall of a gallery or venue. Or perhaps as one-off bespoke gifts. In fact, I'd like to offer the following as a gift to you. If you would like to, either you write a 'this body' statement or I choose one from my entire list, and I'll make something with it and send it to you. Let me know.

[[embodiment and illusion of self]]
[[embodiment is when we are not lost in thought]]
[[the lived body and embodiment]]
[[I move precedes I can]]

Or how about the remarkable transition from _being_ pregnant to _having_ a baby?
