# temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)

_previous note:_ [[we access time through objects or artifacts]]

> And Jimena Canales examines various “timing media” – including telegraphy, photography, cinematography, and precision instruments – and how they “play an essential role in the formation of subjectivity, objectivity, _and_ their historicity.” She proposes that technologies – “some as simple as pushbuttons and triggers, doors, and ordered lists, and others as complex as a particle accelerator or large-scale telescope” – create “temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future).”[@mattern-2017-time n.pag.]

Here's the Canales reference (I have the pdf of [Burges and Elias](hook://file/9vZLrbpCY?p=YWMxOTA2L0Rvd25sb2Fkcw==&n=burges%2D2016%2Dtime%2Epdf)):
