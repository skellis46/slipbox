# concept as method

_previous note:_ [[concepts are abstract ideas]]

Adams St. Pierre describes how she used the Deleuzian concept of the _fold_ as a way to deconstruct difficult methodological aspects of her dissertation: data, the field, the interview. She called this work "methodology in the fold".[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.7] For Adam St. Pierre, this is "concept as method"[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.7] and she deployed it not in the regular sense of method -- guidelines that are planned then executed or followed through -- but as something to slow down and reorient her thinking.

_thoughts & links:_

-- wondering about #finger-pointing-moon  here, and how Adams St. Pierre's thinking might be useful. What would the concept be? visibility and invisibility? (which in itself might be as if [[a border is not a boundary]])  ^28c6e4
- or perhaps empiricism as a concept -- a line. A point of division. Between the epistemic and ontologic: [[modes of thought and practices enabled by modes of thought]]
- compare with [[academic is an insult]] in which artistic research is described as a concept. This feels like a stretch though, but would it be relegating or promoting artistic research if it were understood as a concept in the way the way that Adams St. Pierre is doing?
- perhaps though such a deployment (of artistic research as concept) would be disruptive; as if disrupting something already disruptive. My sense here is that this would be utterly counter-productive. 
- but it leads to the question of what is _concrete_ about artistic research? What is solid about it? Is there anything? 
- what is a concept? -- [[concepts are abstract ideas]]
- thinking also here about conceptual stability in practice-research -- see [[epistemic things are vague#^e2cbd5]]. It's as if there is little to no conceptual stability in practice-research. Is this a bug or a feature? Perhaps what might be useful here are [fuzzy concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_concept) in which the boundaries vary enormously depending on context, but the concepts are not unclear or meaningless. Fuzzy concepts introduce (or allow for) vagueness and clarity.  ^1a3c82
- note also [[inquiry is not thinkable without the knowing subject]] which acts like a warning -- the end game if we pull apart everything: [[humanist qualitative methodology was ruined]]
- [[move slow and restore things]]
