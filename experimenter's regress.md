# experimenter's regress

_previous note:_ [[the sociology of scientific knowledge]]

Collins' contribution to scholarship on the sociology of scientific knowledge centred on the concept of the experimenter's regress. He found that repeating scientific experiments depended on some form of local socialization or the transfer of tacit knowledge. However, there is no test for this type of socialization except for the results of an experiment being correct (i.e. repeating previous research):

> In other words, you had to know what the correct outcome should be before you could know whether the experiment had been competently performed â€” but this is impossible when the correct outcome is what is in question.[Collins, in @collins-2022-science n.pag.]
