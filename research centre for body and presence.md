### area of research 

The _Leverhulme Centre for Body and Presence_ will develop a multidisciplinary programme of research underpinning a new field of scholarship that investigates the nature of being present in the body, and the diverse and important ways this extends into and impacts culture and society.  

Humans benefit from experiences of being present in the body (as distinct from being lost in thought), and studies show these benefits to include reduced distraction, anxiety and loneliness. However, there is more at stake than just psychological health. Cognitive neuroscience research clearly demonstrates how deeply our bodies underpin our thoughts and feelings. Whether it is to combat growing inequity or the climate emergency, our awareness of and sensitivity to individual bodily sensations are central to developing empathy and compassion. This research is **important** because understanding what it means to be **bodily** present is crucial to this. 

The centre will examine the key research problem of what being bodily present is and feels like, and insights achieved from the research will impact other areas in which the nature of being present is vitally important, such as consciousness studies, technology and the self, sociology and spirituality. The interdisciplinary and empirical understanding of these phenomena will lay the groundwork for beneficial societal impacts. For example, healthier lives, increased prosocial behaviour and more considered relationships with the environment and technologies. 

This research is **timely** because it will transform the significance of being bodily present when technologically driven culture is increasingly alienating human beings from the elemental experience of being in our bodies in the present moment. Indeed, the most advanced digital technologies are based on separating our minds from our bodies, whether in online meetings, virtual reality or through social media. In such experiences, we seem to forget our bodies and our sense of selfhood is compromised. 

The research is **transformative** because it changes our relationship to our bodies from a thing we _have_ to something that underpins identity and experience. The unique combination of dance research and cognitive neuroscience radically transforms the lens by which we understand the human capacity to be present through complementary arts and humanities and scientific perspectives. It encompasses both general and situated ways of being present. One example of this are experiences of flow that oscillate between being a subject (or having a sense of self) _doing_ the activity, and the other in which the subject (or self) disappears as if the activity is _being done_ to them. These forms of presence are phenomenologically different-in-kind yet parsing them empirically is a complex and long-term project. These distinct forms of presence are also relevant for our preparedness to act and take on responsibility for what we do or what happens to us.   

Therefore, the research is **original** because it narrows its focus into very precise components of being present in the body and then extrapolates outwards from those insights into a broad range of scholarly fields and societal domains in which being in the here and now transforms human experience.

### research questions

The research questions reflect the dual structure of the research centre: a central hub of research into the nature of presence and the ways in which this research draws other fields into dialogue. _Fundamental questions_ are about the nature of bodily presence phenomenologically and scientifically. _Applied questions_ relate bodily presence to societal issues and challenges.  

_Fundamental questions_ 

- What does it feel like to be ‘in our bodies’ in the present moment? 

- What are the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying bodily presence? 

- How is bodily presence constructed / experienced in online virtual contexts? 

- What roles can movement and physical activity play in preserving a sense of bodily presence? 

- How do neurodiversity and disability differently influence experiences of body awareness and being present? 

- Can body awareness and being present abilities be learned and what changes as a result? 

_Applied questions_ 

- What are the impacts (positive and negative) of being present in distinct areas of culture and society?  

- What is the nature/role/value/importance of bodily presence as society and culture is increasingly predicated on digital modalities?  

- What are the long-term effects of improved body awareness and presence on human relationships to the environment? 

- What role does bodily presence have in increasingly disembodied conditions, in which social interactions are no longer grounded in bodily co-presence, (i.e. online consultations with your GP, distance learning and virtual meetings)?

### Contribution of centre to Research Area

The core **contribution** of the proposed _Leverhulme Centre for Body and Presence_ is to examine the human experience of being present. The multidisciplinary research will be directed from the _inside-out_ using first person phenomenology and the _outside-in_ via third person cognitive neuroscience_._ The Centre will contribute to a **step change in scholarship** through establishing a new field centring the role and efficacy of the body in being present across a **new mix of disciplinary fields**: consciousness studies, cognitive neuroscience, environmental and performance studies, philosophy, phenomenology, religious studies and psychology. To date, the physical body remains at the periphery of these fields despite a) growing evidence of the body’s central role in human emotion, action and perception; and b) how digital technologies continue to draw us further away from being able to attend to the body’s central role in awareness.  

The Centre will coordinate research strategies, methods and outputs, and **transform understanding** of the details and complexity of the nature of _being here and now_ and how the body and body awareness underpin those experiences. This central research will then draw into dialogue key disciplines and fields upon which the nature of presence is vital. The Centre will involve public sector domains in which the importance of being present is more keenly troubling. For instance, organisations working with the dangers of body dysmorphia, the links between social media use and depression, and issues to do with isolation, loneliness and disconnectedness in an increasingly digitised world.

### structure of centre

The _Leverhulme Centre for Body and Presence_ will be a multi-site collaborative centre with two institutions: the _Centre for Dance Research_ at Coventry University and the _Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience_ at University College London. Researchers in these institutions have the experience and expertise to build a long-term multidisciplinary research programme.  

The Centre for Dance Research at Coventry is an internationally renowned hub for dance and movement research with a broad research agenda: somatic (body-based) practices, inclusive dance, copyright and intellectual property law in the arts, and digital documentation of movement practices. 

The UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience (ICN) is a world-leading research centre for the study of mind, brain and behaviour. Interdisciplinary research at the ICN includes the study of behaviour, atypical brain functions and brain imaging. The ICN conducts internationally world-leading cognitive neuroscience research on the body, human movement, interoception and embodied social cognition.

### centre director

Dr. Simon Ellis of C-DaRE (the Centre for Dance Research) will be the centre director. He has 30+ years of experience and research into presence through body-based improvisation and mindfulness practices. His current research focuses on the phenomenology of nonduality in body-based practices. Dr. Ellis also has a multi-disciplinary background in the arts and humanities and in science (biomechanics and kinesiology) and is skilled at working with qualitative, quantitative and non-traditional research methods and multidisciplinary and experimental multimodal research outputs. Ellis has strong experience in multidisciplinary collaboration and project management, and outstanding soft skills that are fundamental to building, managing and leading a research centre: ability to listen carefully, advanced critical thinking, focus on teamwork and collaborative problem solving, deep experience and skill in public speaking and project advocacy, and digital literacy. These skills are all built on a strong work ethic. Dr. Ellis is also a professional dancer and has long-term training in somatic (body-based) principles. This experience means he has lived understanding of the research area. The proposed research centre will happen at an ideal stage of Dr. Ellis’ career and development: he has the energy, will and ambition to build a thriving and inclusive research culture.

> This scheme is to support UK Universities to set up a Research Centre for **_outstanding original research_** aspiring to **_achieve a step-change in scholarship_**. They encourage **_new approaches_** that _may **establish or reshape a field of study**_ and so **_transform our understanding of a significant contemporary topic_**. The centres should have the capacity to **_become recognised internationally for excellence_** in their chosen area. The expectation is that each centre will **_draw upon a range of disciplinary perspectives and expertise_**, perhaps brining new disciplinary mixes to bear on a particular topic.

## Area of Research 

> Please outline the area of Research being proposed for the centre, explaining how the research is: Timely, important, interesting, original, transformative and multidisciplinary (500 words)

We human beings are increasingly alienated from our bodies. This is the body that is the cornerstone of emotions, consciousness, selfhood, movement and simply feeling alive. Seeks to transform this alienation into sensitivity to body as it feels from the inside by building a programme of multidisciplinary research that at its core asks what does it feel like to be human?  

Far more than simply transforming the body as an object of research into the subject. Rather, it is to dissolve the subject-object divide such that there is no 'we' who have bodies. there is simply no 'we'. It is just body being known.

make case for it being a significant contemporary topic

[[the body is not a machine]]

The research is timely as it will seek to transform the role of the sensing/feeling body during a climactic historical moment in human culture, practices and technologies are increasingly divorcing human beings from bodily lived experience: ML and AI, technological/digital imperatives, solutions and logics that render the body as something to be measured, timed, controlled and produced (quantifiable self); social media's role in abstracting what it means to be with others and with one's self; 

The research is important not because it somehow claims somatic practices as a panacea to human woe, but because it builds an inter-disciplinary base on which to develop a research agenda that foregrounds human capacity to feel like what it is to be human. And from this springs a host of potential benefits and impacts: improved sensitivity to illness and pain; 

Transformative: our relationship to our bodies; reduce disciplinary siloes in research, ... Transforming from having bodies to being bodies. See [[an object of special regard]] for history
That unless we know our bodies as they feel to us then we ...

- dance research: previously focused on anthropology, history, artistic creation and production
- cognitive and neuroscience
- phenomenology? 
- health and well being? 
- selfhood
- pain, injury and death (is 'death studies' a thing? !!)
- digital humanities? 
- philosophy -- someone working in field with thinking through other-than-human?
- place for embodied cognition?

How would this be different from 'embodiment' academic field? See [[dance and embodiment#^f83f53]] And how different from somaesthetics? and also the [[somatic turn in human computer interaction]] or just 'somatic turn'?

Increasingly drawn into technological logic -- entertainment, work, data -- seek to expand understanding of the experiential (and analogue) aspects of what it feels like to be human.

We have identified four key areas in which the body as it is experienced from the inside is largely missing, forgotten or rendered inadequate or incomplete: digital and new technologies, medical research and practices and digital humanities. ...??? Deploy multidisciplinary methods in neuroscience, 

some possible areas of interest could be body awareness, consciousness, mindfulness, interoception, perception and sensation, somatics, selfhood, health and well-being, analogue-digital tension (thinking here about how our 'sensing analogue body' is compromised by the seductive power of digital/mediated worlds).  

Build a research programme that foregrounds the body as it is experienced from the inside: the body as it feels, the body as it senses, the body as it is aware. This is research at the intersection of phenomenology, cognitive science, somatics, consciousness studies and philosophy, and that includes research into ... ()

Sensitivity to our bodies and the bodies of others. 
The body as it is experienced from the inside is being left behind -- except for when it needs something or we feel desire.

> Wherever there is experience, there is phenomenology; and wherever there is phenomenology, there is consciousness. Anil Seth (2021) 

100 years ago [name photographer] revealed unique aspects of what humans in motion looked like. The scientific analysis of the human body through medical research, through sport and exercise science, through anatomy (etc -- cog science?) has generated  

Mission is to zoom into what it feels like when we are moving: sitting, walking, standing, running, dancing.
It will not present a singular dimension, approach or understanding to being a body. Multidisciplinary research (in design, methods, analysis and outputs) is at its core.
To reduce the distance or gap between instruments, techniques and procedures that view the body as an object to be measured, recorded, intervened (etc), and practices that foreground the body as felt from the inside. Then to marry this with cutting edge scientific methods in which the body being known (or body being felt) is not forgotten. 

To delve into subject-object language and rationales. 
To identify where the body is missing (or has gone missing)

Distinction from a technologisation of the body (a well thumbed and well supported area of research: wearables, XR, VR) -- or technological extension of the body (technology as tools for the body). Radically analogue proposition at the heart of being human.
