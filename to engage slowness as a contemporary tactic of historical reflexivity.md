# to engage slowness as a contemporary tactic of historical reflexivity

_previous note:_ [[the Dao of butchering cows]]

> In addition, the pleasures of speed and the malignancies of velocity, Lutz Koepnick argues, have blurred how much the present is an experience of “different stories, durations, movements, speeds that energize the present, including this present’s notions of discontinuity and rupture, of promise and loss.”40 Slowness, argues Koepnick, “asks viewers, listeners, and readers to hesitate, not in order to step out of history,” but rather to engage slowness as a contemporary tactic of historical reflexivity by which we can register and reflect on “the co-existence of multiple strands of time in our expanded present.”41 [@burges-2016-introduction p.15]
