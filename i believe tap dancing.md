# i believe tap dancing

[[index -- artistic practice]]

---

This is an idea for a film. It came about when I was in Malta and I met a tap dancer called Annette Walker. She is a friend of Karen Wood's. 

I was thinking about extreme close up work juxtaposed with the sound of her dancing. 

I can imagine long shot of her tapping (z axis), then extreme close-up. The work to be built on the sound of her tapping.

I thought about silent screens that include text developed with her. 

>I believe ...

>I want to be known as ...

Other statements of autobiography.

I thought of doing one of Colin as well.
