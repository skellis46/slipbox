# i believe tap dancing

_previous note:_ [[art, biography, autobiography and truth]]

---

This is an idea for a film. It came about when I was in Malta and I met a tap dancer called Annette Walker. She is a friend of Karen Wood's. 

I was thinking about extreme close up work juxtaposed with the sound of her dancing. 

I can imagine long shot of her tapping (z axis), then extreme close-up. The work to be built on the sound of her tapping.

I thought about silent screens that include text developed with her. 

>I believe ...

>I want to be known as ...

Other statements of autobiography.

I thought of doing one of Colin as well.

- thinking also of [Brannigan's writing about the close-up](hook://file/lFJf61zKu?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=brannigan-2009-micro.pdf)
