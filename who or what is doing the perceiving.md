# who or what is doing the perceiving

_previous note:_ [[perception of our world is bound to our bodies]]

Probably not needed as a note but included because of linking perception, location of self and action.

> A coffee cup out there in the world leads to a perception of a coffee cup generated within the brain. As to who or what is doing the perceiving – well, that’s the ‘self’, isn’t it, the ‘I behind the eyes’ one might say, the recipient of wave upon 77wave of sensory data, which uses its perceptual readouts to guide behaviour, to decide what to do next. There’s a cup of coffee over there. I perceive it and I pick it up. I sense, I think, and then I act. (Location 1297)

- [[losing oneself]]: the language of I is a massive limitation. Avoid it?
