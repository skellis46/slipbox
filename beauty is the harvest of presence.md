# beauty is the harvest of presence

_previous note:_ [[Kaufman - Transcend]]

> Beauty is the harvest of presence.

> Beauty especially occurs in the meeting of time with the timeless; the passing moment framed by what has happened and what is about to occur.[@whyte-2019-consolations n.pag.]

- reminded here in [[footfall]] of the possibility of a still image referencing _presence_ (and perhaps even of the desire to make beautiful things)
- [[Kabat-Zinn - Wherever You Go, There You Are]]
- [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
- see edit bin in [[nature, art and habitat proposal#^735453]]
- [[finger pointing at the moon]] re beauty of art

- link to Kaufman is [[Kaufman - Transcend#^1a5ce6]] and regarding the 'being-world'.
