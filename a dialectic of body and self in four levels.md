# a dialectic of body and self in four levels

_previous note:_ [[Mehling - Body Awareness a phenomenological inquiry into the common ground of mind-body therapies]]

> The process that patients undergo in these therapies was seen as a progression towards greater unity between body and self, very similar to the conceptualization of embodiment as a dialectic of body and self described by some philosophers as being experienced in four levels [56]: 1) in a level labeled “the lived body” the body is taken for granted, and patients are unself-consciously aware or unaware of it, the body often described as “absent” [57]. This state was well-described by the patients when they began their practices. 2) in a level labeled “the objective body state” the body is experienced as opposed to the self. Body and self are in tension with each other or in disunity, the body becomes “symptomatic” and the patient describes physical constraints including pain and some degree of loss of function. That state seemed to be the situation that brought the patients into the therapy. 3) A third stage labeled as “cultivated immediacy” was described by practitioners and patients as well: it is experienced as a new relationship to the body characterized by acceptance, immediacy and the body experienced without objectification. 4) In the fourth state labeled “the subjective body” the body is experienced as a source of learning and meaning, by practitioners described as endowed with “intelligence” and an “innate tendency towards embodiment”. In this state the body a) is no longer just the means by which the self carries out its projects or b) the source of constraints and limits to the self’s goals, but rather an integral and equal part of the self and the locus of consciousness and subjectivity with its own perspective [55].
