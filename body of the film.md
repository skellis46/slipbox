# body of the film

_previous note:_  [[path and attention of the camera]]

---

There is a distinct difference between the technological body of the film -- what Barker describes as the "enabling mechanism"[p.10] of the film, similar to producers, directors, etc -- and the film's body:

>The film's body is the mechanism through which its intentional projects in the world take shape.[p.10]

Normally, we are not able to see this body because it is transparent. Rather, we see the "perception and expression that it makes possible, but not the body itself".[p.10] Barker suggests that in Tarkovky's _Mirror_ (1975) the film's body is a "ghostly entity"[p.10] that is more explicitly present than in most narrative films, but far less so than in self-consciously (or "blatantly"[p.11]) reflexive films. 

>Gabrielle Hezekiah summarizes the unique role of the film's body this way: "It is presented to us a technologically mediated consciousness of experience and to itself as an immediate experience of consciousness"[p.8]


_questions & thoughts:_

- does this mean that the film's body is ever-present but rarely announced as in Barker's example of Tarkovsky?
- the film's body seems to be such a strong metaphor for how we ideally would present ideas in practice-research -- that the mechanism is not foregrounded, but rather we see the traces of affect (or something like this)

- modes of presentation in practice-research
