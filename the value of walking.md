# the value of walking

_previous note:_ [[walking and thinking]]

> Since then, I’ve serendipitously encountered a handful of similar meditations on the value of walking, so I’ve taken that as sign to briefly gather some of these together and offer them to you, chiefly because they collectively remind us that there is a scale of activity and experience appropriate to the human animal and things tend to go well for us when we mind it.


> That said, I’ll first note the Latin phrase *solvitur ambulando* meaning “it is solved by walking.” The phrase is attributed to both St. Augustine and the Greek philosopher, Diogenes. The sense of it, as I take it, is that when you are stuck on something, you should get up and take a walk. By the act of walking you somehow allow your mind to think more freely and creatively.


> In a 2014 [report](https://substack.com/redirect/1d18ba3e-15b1-4413-8616-7c6f08b08ac4?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) in the *Journal of Experimental Psychology*, Marily Oppezzo and Daniel L. Schwartz confirmed the effect and postulated a series of causal mechanisms. Among other findings, the authors concluded that “walking substantially enhanced creativity.” They also wisely observed that “while schools are cutting back on physical education in favor of seated academics, the neglect of the body in favor of the mind ignores their tight interdependence.”

> I’ve lately heard a great deal about how writing is a form of thinking. There is a stronger sense in which one could take that claim, but it at least means that the practice of writing, in its material and embodied dimensions, is conducive to and even sustains specific forms of thinking. In the same way, we might perhaps say that walking is a practice that is conducive to certain modes of thought. We can walk in order to think, just as some might write in order to think. My sense is that this has something to do with the pacing of our thoughts. Both writing and waking, each in their own way, seem to calibrate the tempo of our minds to the rhythm of thought.

> This notion was also articulated by Rebecca Solnit when she observed “that the mind, like the feet, works at about three miles an hour. If this is so, then modern life is moving faster than the speed of thought.”

> “At three miles an hour, the world is a continuum,” Hunt astutely observed.

> Hunt also brought the lovely phrase “the soul travels at the speed of walking” to my attention. It is apparently an old Arabic saying, and it is the insight at the heart of Hunt’s essay, which also reflects on the practice of pilgrimage.

> Not all walking amounts to a pilgrimage, of course, but we can think of all walks as potentially containing a kernel of the pilgrimage experience. In an old post about the distinction between the tourist and the pilgrim, I once [noted](https://substack.com/redirect/8c5ee88d-dbf4-44e4-97f7-6f34c73ffa12?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) that the tourist bends the place to the shape of the self while the pilgrim is bent to the shape of the journey. I do think the length of the journey matters in such cases, but perhaps a walk of any sort, if we set out in the proper spirit, might afford us the opportunity to practice the virtue of setting ourselves aside.

> The title of that [installment](https://substack.com/redirect/1cc572df-fa2f-4b8a-b256-ef758d0e1b56?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) was a line from the filmmaker Werner Herzog: “The world reveals itself to those who walk.”

> That’s a wonderfully concise and profound observation. Of course, I was inclined to agree with the sentiment because it captures something [I have been articulating](https://substack.com/redirect/45a986c8-cac8-4e12-888e-fffa69dc31d6?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc), at much greater length, for some time now. The world is not simply present to us in its fullness and depth by virtue of the fact that we are capable of glancing at it. Instead, if we are to see the world, we must attend to it with care, patience, and even love.

> This kind of attention can only unfold under certain conditions—solitude, silence, stillness—and in relation to certain virtues—humility, perseverance, charity. Among the conditions conducive to attentiveness I would also include deliberate slowness. Past a certain speed, we simply cannot perceive the world in depth.

> This principle of proportionality or fittingness is one that we do well to remember and insist upon to whatever degree we are able because almost everything about the human-built world, in its economic and technological dimensions, is bent on pushing us past a human scale and speed, which then denies us the opportunity to cultivate our competence and enjoy its rewards. We are, in turn, sold a series of tools and techniques that promise to help us operate faster and more efficiently so that we may keep up with the inhuman demands. Some will even say that the point is to eventually slough off the encumbering body so that we may keep up with the machines and find our fit within the artificial systems we have built. Only exhaustion and alienation lie down this path.
