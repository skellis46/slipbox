# brain versus body is the new dualism

_previous note:_ [[a stable sense of self is rooted in the lungs, heart and gut]]

> An important limitation of contemporary psychology and neuroscience is that scholars replaced the old Cartesian dualism – mind versus body – with a new dualism: brain versus body. The new dichotomy was even cruder than the old one, and certainly no less rigid. Experimenters refused to take note of whatever happened south of the neck because the scientific picture du jour dismissed what previous ages had carefully noted – the wisdom of the heart, the power of breathing, and the intelligence of the gut.[@monti-2021-stable n.pag.]
