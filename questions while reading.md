This is a list of the different kinds of questions that Ahrens describes in _How to take smart notes_:

- What is interesting about this?
- What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?
- How does this fact fit into my idea of â€¦? 
- Does this contradict or strengthen another idea? 
- Have I heard something like this before? 
- What does x mean for y? 
- What frame/theoretical background/methodological approach/perspective is being used? 
- What is not mentioned? What is not in the picture?
- Seek dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking
- What is not meant, what is excluded if a certain claim is made? 
- Are there any patterns? 
- What questions are already present for me and how do they influence what I'm reading?
- What are the limitations of the approach/text?
- How is this important to my own lines of thought?
- Is it convincing? 
- Which references are familiar to me? 
- What is it similar to? What is it different from?
- Ask counterfactual questions, like "What if?"
- What kind of answer ought I expect if I ask a particular question in a particular way? 
- How might this change what I understand or the way I am thinking?
