# consciousness recognises itself as activity in mind or body

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

> During the appearance of mind, That-Which-Is-Ever-Present is the substance of that appearance and yet is apparently disguised as such. In this case Consciousness fails to recognize itself. However, once this understanding, this Self-recognition, has taken place, Consciousness no longer needs to forget itself during the appearance of the mind (or the body or the world). It recognizes itself in and as the activity of the mind as well as in its absence.[@spira-2008-transparency n.pag.]

Spira is referring to consciousness when he writes That-Which-Is-Ever-Present. It's not so clear what understanding he is referring to (and when it has taken place) .I probably need to re-read that section. 

Nevertheless, perhaps consciousness that forgets itself and when it no longer needs to forget itself is potentially a way of accounting for the transition from awareness-ing to [[becoming the passenger]] in improvisation. In other words, while awareness-ing consciousness forgets itself during the appearance of the body, while being a passenger consciousness no longer needs to forget itself and instead recognises itself in and as the activity of the body as well as in its absence. 

I wonder where [[flow]] and [[flow and nonduality]] might fit into this proposition. If I were to hazard a guess flow _exists_ on the passenger side of the experience. But that does not make it synonymous with [[nonduality]].
