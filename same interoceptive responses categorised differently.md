# same interoceptive responses categorised differently

_previous note:_ [[interoception]]

---

This is important -- the simple idea that the same interoceptive information might elicit (or be categorised as) different emotions.

> Interoceptive signals vary in motivational immediacy, yet they include information for homeostatic reflexes and for allostatic control, and include feedback of physiological changes induced by emotions. People refer to internal bodily sensations when describing their emotional experiences, with some consistency. This categorical association is likely reinforced by cultural consensus, translating perceived interoceptive responses into a social language that supports emotional understanding of self and others. However, the same interoceptive responses may be categorised emotionally in different ways. The choice of descriptor can reflect how bodily arousal signals are interpreted emotionally (churning or butterflies in stomach; heart missing or skipping a beat). Nevertheless, the coupling of physiological changes to emotional experience is central to theoretical proposals arguing for an interoceptive basis to emotional feelings.[@critchley-2017-interoception p.7]
