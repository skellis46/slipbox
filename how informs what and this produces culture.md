# how informs what and this produces culture

Postman's argument is that the means by which we have discussions informs what those discussions are able to easily express, and that easily expressible ideas become central markers of culture. Postman's argument: 

> ... fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.[@postman-2006-amusing p.6]

To understand what is possible and what is not given the terms of a medium is fundamental. But I'm struck by the idea of something being convenient to express. Convenience matters enormously. Think memes. Which of course begs the question about the value of things/experiences that are inconvenient to express. 

Postman uses the example of the 'news of the day' and how it could not exist until the creation of the telegraph. There was not 'stuff' to create the news of the day until that time; "in a world that lacked the media to give it expression."[@postman-2006-amusing p.7]

> The news of the day is a figment of our technological imagination.[@postman-2006-amusing p.8]

This is the heart. What I saw on the common that day is different from Susan and ABBA. BUT HOW? Less friction. Image/visuals. Fidelity. Ease of tech. My behaviour could have interrupted the recording. Ruined it. Introducing noise. Like an audio photo bomb. These are the Screendances of now. Of our future. The ones that matter. Really? 

Their dancing (the two girls) is the way it is because of the social. They are enframed. It's repeatable. It stops and starts. It's reversible. This is no accident that their movement is the way it is. It's not just any kind of movement. It's anything but indeterminate. They are being choreographed (go search for indeterminacy in Devonthink). Compare this with [[Zuboff – The Age of Surveillance Capitalism#VI Executing the Uncontract]]: "thus replacing the indeterminacy of social processes with the determinism of programmed machine processes."[@zuboff-2019-age n.pag.]

> I have remained steadfast to [McLuhan's] teaching that the clearest way to see through a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation.[@postman-2006-amusing p.8]

He clarifies McLuhan's "the medium is the message" by suggesting that the word _message_ implies something too direct or concrete. Postman thinks rather that mediums "are rather like metaphors, working by unobtrusive but powerful implication to enforce their special definitions of reality."[@postman-2006-amusing p.10]

>I bring all of this up because what my book is about is how our own tribe is undergoing a vast and trembling shift from the magic of writing to the magic of electronics. What I mean to point out here is that the introduction into a culture of a technique such as writing or a clock is not merely an extension of man's power to bind time but a transformation of his way of thinking—and, of course, of the content of his culture. And that is what I mean to say by calling a medium a metaphor.[@postman-2006-amusing p.13]

The introduction of new techniques transforms not only our behaviour, but how we think.
