# I am a collaboration

_previous note:_ [[children of the soil - short description of film]]

> This porousness that was caused by trauma and illness gave me a big sense of myself as an instrument being played – by microbes, by yeasts, by fungi, by other people. So sometimes the music that comes through me is not my own. And then when I read more about the science of the gut-brain axis, and about deep time and the history of our cells, I was given a comforting lens that I am a collaboration. When we focus on an individual sense of ourselves, it can act and feel like a weight. We always have to be an author, to know what the next best step is, and be in control of our lives. But if we think of ourselves as being a kind of ecosystem, we can understand that we are sometimes acting intuitively, in relationship with something else that is authoring us.[Sophie Strand, in @ducann-2022-my p.80]

- thinking also of [[Krznaric - The Good Ancestor]] particularly to do with individualistic culture and dominance of short-range thinking. see [[Krznaric - The Good Ancestor#^35d427]]
- tangentially related to Postman's thinking on [[technology and individualism]] and economic need or greed
- also Ginot as tension between 'singular subjective body' in Ginot in [[somatics and the homogenous body]] and the claims made in somatics about being in relation to the world. 
- how distinct Strand's thinking is compared with most practice-research in which the author (normally singular) makes claims for the value of their work independent of the community of practice
- contrast with [[privacy and independence]] and the need for interior spaces for individuation and also the potential for somatic practices to provide these kinds of interior spaces
