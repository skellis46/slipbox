# ecology is a steady state economy

_previous note:_ [[Weber - Enlivenment]]

> Ecology is a steady-Â­state economy. It does not grow; it evolves. The only factor of nature that expands is its immaterial dimension, which could be called a _depth of experience_: the diversity of natural forms and the variety of ways to experience aliveness.[@weber-2019-enlivenment p.41]

- thinking of how this might be useful for network grant with JB and EP
- also useful re [[artistic research and ecosystems]] and just what 'depth of experience' might mean in practice research?
