# the outer and the inner world

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> If the arts and sciences are ways of attending to the world – both the outer world and the inner world – how might a reciprocal engagement across both disciplines support us to become better at looking after it and better at understanding the interconnections between systems and psycho–physical–spiritual states? How might we move in a world where Gaia has become a system, where once she was an ancestral Mother?[@brown-2020-hau p.71]


_thoughts & links:_

- are Brown and Reihana-Morunga describing that the arts are inner worlds and the sciences outer worlds? That was my first reading but I suspect they are suggesting that both apply to both. 
- [[nature, art and habitat proposal]] - simple idea re interconnections, and psycho-physical-spiritual states
- [[the circulation of oxygen]] - re air (in edit bin)
