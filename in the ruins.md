#  in the ruins

Dear

Richard Feynman, the Nobel-winning physicist (and occasional safe-cracker), once posed a striking thought experiment in _The Feynman Lectures on Physics_:

> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence could be passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words?

His answer has since become famous: _all things are made of atoms_.[^1]

Forgive me, Mr. Feynman, but I can’t resist appropriating your question. What if, in some future cataclysm, all dance knowledge were destroyed? What single sentence might carry enough truth to spark its rediscovery?

[^1]: F's full response was actually: "I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that **all things are made of atoms**—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another."

Unlike science, dance is fundamentally human. That is, it is not something we created or that became possible through technological, philosophical and intellectual advances. Dance is what Graebner and Wengrow describe as an extremely human activity.[^2] 

[^2]: Graeber, D. and Wengrow, D. (2021) _The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity_. First American edition. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Chapter 4, n.pag

Because dance is central to being human, the obvious platitudes won’t do:  _dance is more than moving to music_ or  _movement is language beyond words_. 

Perhaps my task here would be easier if I were to refer to a particular kind of dancing. Music is a useful parallel in this instance. For example, we can more easily talk about knowledge associated with jazz music (as contested as that form might be) compared with _all_ music. But I like the slipperiness and absurdity of this endeavour. So, all dance it is. 

Here are four possibilities. 

1. The body moves, and others move with it.
2. Dance begins when stillness ends.
3. Dance is what the body remembers.
4. Movement becomes dance when it matters.

Remember, the task is to imagine a world stripped of dance knowledge, where someone stumbles across a single surviving sentence and begins to rebuild from there.

Which sentence would you want discovered in the ruins? 



## edit bin

I think the first is too abstract. The sentence needs to make sense _after_ the destruction of all dance knowledge. Having said that, I like the way that it includes a beautiful social dimension to moving (human) bodies.

The second is deep in the land of Steve Paxton's small dance and alludes to the impossibility of stillness when we stop to pay attention.

The third is a bit like the first but perhaps more open. It includes all dancing, but also things that aren't normally thought of as dancing; the way the memory of hugging a friend who is now dead can be imagined or understood as dancing. 

The fourth inserts that 'matters' word into the equation and immediately ignores movement that doesn't matter as being dance.

and it is as natural as walking and we know it when we see it (except in some of that hifalutin experimental dance that doesn't include any, well, dancing). If dance is as natural as walking, maybe no sentence is needed. And yet ... 

Forgive me here for my hubris Mr. Feynman ...
