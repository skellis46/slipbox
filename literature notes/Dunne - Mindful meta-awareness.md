# John D Dunne, Evan Thompson and Jonathan Schooler - Mindful meta-awareness: sustained and non-propositional

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM: 

This paper argues that a key part of mindfulness is not just paying attention to something like the breath, but also having an ongoing, background sense of how your attention is behaving. The authors call this “mindful meta-awareness”. Crucially, they say this awareness does not need to be verbal or analytical. It can be a steady, felt knowing of whether attention is present, drifting or settled, without stopping to think about it or label it in words. This challenges a common assumption in psychology that meta-awareness always involves explicit thoughts like “I am distracted now” .

The authors draw on Buddhist theory, contemporary mindfulness research and examples such as pain regulation and lucid dreaming to show why this matters. They suggest that many benefits of mindfulness training come from cultivating this sustained, non-verbal awareness, rather than from repeatedly checking in with verbal judgments about one’s mental state. Because this kind of awareness is quiet and continuous, it may also explain why mindfulness can reduce reactivity and improve emotional regulation even when people are not consciously “monitoring” themselves. The paper concludes by arguing that mindfulness research needs better concepts and methods to study this subtle but central aspect of experience .
