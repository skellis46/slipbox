# Sleigh - Relationships Between the Cracks: Making Oddkin

_previous note:_ [[a border is not a boundary]]

- cites Jamie Heckert on borders and boundaries within non-monogamy:

> Whereas borders claim the unquestionable and rigid authority of law, boundaries have a fluidity, and openess to change; more a riverbank, less a stone canal. Borders demand respect, boundaries invite it. Borders divide desirables from undesirables, boundaries respect the diversity of desires.[Heckert, in @sleigh-2022-relationships p.88]

- oral storytelling (carried within the body) is not single authorship but a collage, p.88 (idea from Doireann Ní Ghríofa)
- etymology of word text is "texere" -- to weave, to fuse, to brain
- Bayo Akomolafe: 'the times are urgent; let us slow down', p.89
