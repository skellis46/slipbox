## Highlights

> In a similar vein, statements such as “it can be argued” or “it was decided”, using the passive voice, avoid responsibility. It is much better to say “I will argue that” or “we decided that” and then go on to prosecute the argument or justify the decision.
>  Taking responsibility for our stances and reasoning is important culturally as well as academically. In a participatory democracy, we are expected to be accountable for our ideas and choices. It is also a stand against the kinds of anonymous assertions that easily proliferate via fake and unnamed social media accounts.

> Removing the author’s presence can allow important cultural or other perspectives held by the author to remain unexamined. This can lead to the so-called [crisis of representation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297525123_The_crisis_in_representation_Reflections_and_assessments), in which the interpretation of texts and other cultural artefacts is removed from any interpretive stance of the author.

> To make their thinking most clearly an object of my study, I need them to make themselves the subjects of their writing.
>  I prefer students to write something like “I am not convinced by Dawson’s argument because…” rather than “Dawson’s argument is opposed by DeVries, who says …”. I want to understand *their* thinking not just use the argument of DeVries.
>  Of course I would hope they do engage with DeVries, but then I’d want them to say which argument they find more convincing and what their *own* reasons were for being convinced.
>  Just stating Devries’ objection is good analysis, but we also need students to evaluate and justify, and it is here that the first person position is most useful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5zbpnrj5w93ezzx6dc65z5e))
