## Highlights

> These thoughts have been prompted by my revisiting a book I first read several decades ago: the neurologist Oliver Sacks’s [*Awakenings*](https://www.oliversacks.com/oliver-sacks-books/awakenings/), first published fifty years ago. It is, I believe, an essential book for our moment. It is a kind of manifesto for a forgotten humanism. And humanism — properly understood, properly chastened — forcefully repudiates the tyranny of categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6p13qb0cj2ahfj62qp5gnf))


> “Romantic science” is a phrase that Oliver Sacks learned from A. R. Luria, a Soviet neuropsychologist. Luria was Sacks’s great hero. “When I heard him lecture in London in 1959,” Sacks recalled, “I was overwhelmed by his combination of intellectual power and human warmth — I had often encountered these separately, but I had not too often encountered them *together* — and it was exactly this combination, which so pleased me in his work, and which made it such an antidote to certain trends in medical writing, which attempted to delete both subjectivity and reflection.” Sacks could not then know how directly Luria’s work would become a model for his own.

> In his late memoir *The Making of Mind*, Luria meditates on a distinction he learned from Max Verworn, a German physiologist: Scientists, Verworn believed, typically have either a “classical” or a “romantic” disposition, and this disposition affects how they approach science. “Classical scholars,” says Luria, “are those who look upon events in terms of their constituent parts. Step by step they single out important units and elements until they can formulate abstract, general laws. These laws are then seen as the governing agents of the phenomena in the field under study. One outcome of this approach is the reduction of living reality with all its richness of detail to abstract schemas.” By contrast, “It is of the utmost importance to romantics to preserve the wealth of living reality, and they aspire to a science that retains this richness.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6p8wwcgbz60vqh03g52281))


> There is something utterly profound in this *humanism of the abyss*, for it is as though Leonard is saying, “This happened to me and to me only — but it could have happened to any other human being.” The act of striving to communicate the incommunicable is a double acknowledgment: of the chasm of experience that separates every person from every other person, and the possibility of using language and image to generate connection, to generate empathy, to generate what our ancestors called “fellow feeling” — out of nothing but air and chalk marks on a slate.

> Sacks’s book is especially welcome and relevant because our current cultural moment is characterized, I believe, by a distinctive *evacuation of the human*. This happens in two contrasting but strangely complementary ways. First, we are regularly encouraged to perceive our experience in terms of a certain set of identity markers — typically involving race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, the sorts of things that we can mark on checklists — and to deny that those who do not share those identity markers can fully grasp our experience. But, second, we are also encouraged to think of the many ways in which we share a perceptual and experiential world with the nonhuman, the *other* creatures with which we are, as humanities professor Donna Haraway says, “[companion species](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo3645022.html).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6pkdwa6vtb4g5t6yqysgak))


> There is a partial but vital understanding that can arise between humans, even if they are on opposite ends of an ideological spectrum. That word “understanding” is a numinous one for Sacks, because, to him, understanding is precisely what “classical science” forgoes, and what “romantic science” cares about most deeply. In one of the long footnotes in *Awakenings* — really they are digressive essays — he writes, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6pptfdsfx9mvhj3qynwav1))


> Thus we fill out our forms, *identifying* ourselves to a system that is concerned with identification and not with understanding. Diabetic? History of heart disease? And we find the same in the political realm: Proqueer? White nationalist? We can never let ourselves sprawl; there’s no room for it on the forms.

> Whether our current system can be reformed I don’t know. But I strongly believe that it does more than any other force in society to transform us into the kinds of people who come in kinds — to think of ourselves as having been *identified*, and to have kinship primarily with those who have been identified as we have. This happens not just to people who find their fellows-in-disease through hashtags on Instagram or TikTok, but to all of us who dutifully fill out our forms, the forms that enable us to identify our “case” — to become our categories.
