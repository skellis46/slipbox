# Percival - Unzipping Mr. Rabbit

_previous note:_

> In the scientific literature they are called 'ultra-processed foods' or 'UPFs', but I prefer to call them pseudofoods, for they are 'false foods', a sham. The category was first described in 2008 by Brazilian researchers who suggested that 'nutrient profiling' might only provide a partial picture of the impact of foods on health. We're used to thinking of a food's nutrient profile – how much protein, iron or vitamin C it contains, for example. The researchers suggested the degree of processing should also be assessed. We should accordingly distinguish 'fresh and minimally processed' foods (such a fresh veg and meat) and those that have been 'traditionally' processed (by fermenting, pickling or tinning) from those which have undergone 'ultra processing', characterised by industrial techniques and chemical additives.

> Ultra-processed pseudofoods make up more than 60 percent of the average diet in the UK, and children typically consume an even higher proportion. [@percival-2023-unzipping p.10]
