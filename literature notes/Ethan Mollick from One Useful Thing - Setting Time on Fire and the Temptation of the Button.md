## Highlights

> But then The Button starts to tempt everyone. Work that was boring to do, but meaningful when completed by humans (like performance reviews) becomes easy to outsource - and the apparent quality actually increases. We start to create documents mostly with AI that get sent to AI-powered inboxes where the recipients respond mostly with AI. Even worse, we still create the reports by hand, but realize that no human is actually reading them. This kind of meaningless task, what organizational theorists have called [mere ceremony](https://substack.com/redirect/4feeab06-11e2-4595-a0d7-2323a12c214b?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) , has always been with us. But AI will make a lot of previously useful tasks meaningless. It it will also remove the facade that previously disguised meaningless tasks. We may not have always known if our work mattered in the bigger picture, but in most organizations, the people in your part of the organizational structure felt that it did. With AI-generated work sent to other AIs to assess, that sense of meaning disappears. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22dj0fm5ehfsmgt94y1zt6r))


> I don’t see a way that we avoid dealing with this coming storm. So many important processes assume that the amount and quality of our written output is a useful measure of thoughtfulness, effort, and time. If we don’t start thinking about this shift in meaning now (which does not require any AI more advanced that what is currently available), we are likely to face a series of crises of meaning, as centuries-old approaches to filtering and signalling lose all of their value. It is already happening throughout education, as essays are increasingly AI-generated. It is going to happen elsewhere, soon, as everyone gets access to their own version of The Button.
