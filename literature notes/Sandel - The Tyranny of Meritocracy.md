# Sandel - The Tyranny of Meritocracy: What's Become of the Public Good?

> Once market value is taken as a proxy for social contribution, however, it is hard to resist the thought that people deserve, as a matter of justice, whatever income corresponds to their market value, or “marginal product” in the economist’s jargon. According to standard economic analysis, perfectly competitive markets pay each worker the value of his or her “marginal product,” the value of output attributable to that worker.
> If, notwithstanding the complexity of the economy, it is possible to identify and individuate each person’s market value in this way, and if market value is the true measure of social contribution, then it is a short step to concluding that people morally deserve to be paid according to their “marginal product,” or market value.
> A recent version of this argument has been advanced by Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, who served as an economic advisor to President George W. Bush. Mankiw begins by stating a widely held and intuitively appealing moral principle: “People should get what they deserve. A person who contributes more to society deserves a higher income that reﬂects those greater contributions.” He offers, as examples, Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, and J. K. Rowling, author of the wildly popular Harry Potter books. Most people agree that they deserve the millions they have made, Mankiw suggests, because their high earnings reﬂect the great value to society of iPhones and riveting adventure tales.
> Mankiw would extend this reasoning to all incomes in a competitive market economy: Morality should endorse the results that competitive markets generate, for care workers and hedge fund managers alike. Since “each person’s income reﬂects the value of what he contributed to society’s production of goods and services,” Mankiw argues, “one might easily conclude that, under these idealized conditions, each person receives his just deserts.” 40 (p.136)

> But there was a further problem. The focus on maximizing GDP, even if accompanied by help for those left behind, puts the emphasis on consumption rather than production. It invites us to think of ourselves more as consumers than as producers. In practice, of course, we are both. As consumers, we want to get the most for our money, to buy goods and services as cheaply as possible, whether they are made by low-wage workers overseas or well-paid American workers. As producers, we want satisfying and remunerative work.(p.207 - check)

> For the more we think of ourselves as self-made and self-sufﬁcient, the harder it is to learn gratitude and humility. And without these sentiments, it is hard to care for the common good.

> The technocratic conception of politics is bound up with a faith in markets—not necessarily unfettered, laissez-faire capitalism, but the broader belief that market mechanisms are the primary instruments for achieving the public good. This way of thinking about politics is technocratic in the sense that it drains public discourse of substantive moral argument and treats ideologically contestable questions as if they were matters of economic efficiency, the province of experts.

>  They need to ask why those who have not ﬂourished in the new economy feel that the winners look down with disdain.

> But today, the countries with the highest mobility tend to be those with the greatest equality. The ability to rise, it seems, depends less on the spur of poverty than on access to education, health care, and other resources that equip people to succeed in the world of work.

> Morally, it is unclear why the talented deserve the outsize rewards that market-driven societies lavish on the successful. Central to the case for the meritocratic ethic is the idea that we do not deserve to be rewarded, or held back, based on factors beyond our control. But is having (or lacking) certain talents really our own doing? If not, it is hard to see why those who rise thanks to their talents deserve greater rewards than those who may be equally hardworking but less endowed with the gifts a market society happens to prize.

> The relentless emphasis on creating a fair meritocracy, in which social positions reﬂect effort and talent, has a corrosive effect on the way we interpret our success (or the lack of it). The notion that the system rewards talent and hard work encourages the winners to consider their success their own doing, a measure of their virtue—and to look down upon those less fortunate than themselves.

> A lively sense of the contingency of our lot conduces to a certain humility: “There, but for the grace of God, or the accident of fortune, go I.”But a perfect meritocracy banishes all sense of gift or grace. It diminishes our capacity to see ourselves as sharing a common fate. It leaves little room for the solidarity that can arise when we reﬂect on the contingency of our talents and fortunes. This is what makes merit a kind of tyranny, or unjust rule.


> Our technocratic version of meritocracy severs the link between merit and moral judgment. In the domain of the economy, it simply assumes that the common good is deﬁned by GDP, and that the value of people’s contributions consists in the market value of the goods or services they sell. In the domain of government, it assumes that merit means technocratic expertise. This can be seen in the growing role of economists as policy advisors, the increasing reliance on market mechanisms to deﬁne and achieve the public good, and the failure of public discourse to address the large moral and civic questions that should be at the center of political debate: What should we do about rising inequality? What is the moral signiﬁcance of national borders? What makes for the dignity of work? What do we owe one another as citizens?

> Not only has technocratic merit failed as a mode of governance; it has also narrowed the civic project. Today, the common good is understood mainly in economic terms. It is less about cultivating solidarity or deepening the bonds of citizenship than about satisfying consumer preferences as measured by the gross domestic product. This makes for an impoverished public discourse.

> Four decades of market-driven globalization have hollowed out public discourse, disempowered ordinary citizens, and prompted a populist backlash that seeks to clothe the naked public square with an intolerant, vengeful nationalism.

> Inspiring though it is, the principle of merit can take a tyrannical turn, not only when societies fail to live up to it, but also—indeed especially—when they do. The dark side of the meritocratic ideal is embedded in its most alluring promise, the promise of mastery and self-making. This promise comes with a burden that is difﬁcult to bear. The meritocratic ideal places great weight on the notion of personal responsibility. Holding people responsible for what they do is a good thing, up to a point. It respects their capacity to think and act for themselves, as moral agents and as citizens. But it is one thing to hold people responsible for acting morally; it is something else to assume that we are, each of us, wholly responsible for our lot in life.


> Conﬁdent of their election, this spiritual aristocracy of the elect looked down with disdain on those apparently destined for damnation. Here Weber glimpses what I would call an early version of meritocratic hubris. “The consciousness of divine grace of the elect and holy was accompanied by an attitude toward the sin of one’s neighbor, not of sympathetic understanding based on consciousness of one’s own weakness, but of hatred and contempt for him as an enemy of God bearing the signs of eternal damnation.” 19 The Protestant work ethic, then, not only gives rise to the spirit of capitalism. It also promotes an ethic of self-help and of responsibility for one’s fate congenial to meritocratic ways of thinking. 

- this for DaL. Re ecosystem, togetherness. 

> But even today, our attitudes toward success are not as independent of providential faith as we sometimes think. The notion that we are free human agents, capable of rising and succeeding by our own effort, is only one aspect of meritocracy. Equally important is the conviction that those who succeed deserve their success. This triumphalist aspect of meritocracy generates hubris among the winners and humiliation among the losers. It reﬂects a residual providential faith that persists in the moral vocabulary of otherwise secular societies.
> “The fortunate [person] is seldom satisﬁed with the fact of being fortunate,” Max Weber observed. “Beyond this, he needs to know that he has a right to his good fortune. He wants to be convinced that he ‘deserves’ it, and above all, that he deserves it in comparison with others. He wishes to be allowed the belief that the less fortunate also merely experience [their] due.” 20

> This triumphalist aspect of meritocracy is a kind of providentialism without God, at least without a God who intervenes in human affairs. The successful make it on their own, but their success attests to their virtue. This way of thinking heightens the moral stakes of economic competition. It sanctiﬁes the winners and denigrates the losers.

> Lears sees in American public culture an uneven contest between an ethic of fortune and a more muscular ethic of mastery. The ethic of fortune appreciates the dimensions of life that exceed human understanding and control. It sees that the cosmos does not necessarily match merit with reward. It leaves room for mystery, tragedy, and humility. It is the sensibility of Ecclesiastes: “I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.” 23

> These days, we view success the way the Puritans viewed salvation—not as a matter of luck or grace, but as something we earn through our own effort and striving. This is the heart of the meritocratic ethic. It celebrates freedom—the ability to control my destiny by dint of hard work—and deservingness. If I am responsible for having accrued a handsome share of worldly goods—income and wealth, power and prestige—I must deserve them. Success is a sign of virtue. My afﬂuence is my due.

> This way of thinking is empowering. It encourages people to think of themselves as responsible for their fate, not as victims of forces beyond their control. But it also has a dark side. The more we view ourselves as self-made and self-sufﬁcient, the less likely we are to care for the fate of those less fortunate than ourselves. If my success is my own doing, their failure must be their fault. This logic makes meritocracy corrosive of commonality. Too strenuous a notion of personal responsibility for our fate makes it hard to imagine ourselves in other people’s shoes.

> To be sure, markets do not necessarily rest on meritocratic assumptions. The most familiar arguments for markets are about utility and freedom. The ﬁrst argues that markets create incentives that boost GDP and maximize the general welfare; the second argues that markets leave people free to choose what value to place on the goods they exchange. 
> But the market triumphalism of the 1980s prompted the articulation of a third, meritocratic rationale: Provided they operate within a fair system of equal opportunity, markets give people what they deserve. As long as everyone has an equal chance to compete, market outcomes reward merit.

> But beyond fairness and productivity, the liberal argument also gestured toward a third, more potent ideal implicit in the case for markets: Enabling people to compete solely on the basis of effort and talent would bring market outcomes into alignment with merit. In a society where opportunities were truly equal, markets would give people their just deserts.

> One aspect of the meritocratic turn displays the hard side of meritocracy. This aspect ﬁnds expression in the demanding notions of personal responsibility that have accompanied attempts to rein in the welfare state and to shift risks from governments and companies to individuals. 3  A second aspect of the meritocratic turn is more aspirational. It ﬁnds expression in what might be called the rhetoric of rising, the promise that those who work hard and play by the rules deserve to rise as far as their talents and dreams will take them. 

> Credentialism is also changing the face of representative government in Britain and Europe. In Britain, as in the U.S., those with diplomas govern those without. In the United Kingdom as a whole, about 70 percent do not have a university degree; in Parliament, only 12 percent do not. Nearly nine of ten MPs have degrees; one-fourth of MPs went to Oxford or Cambridge.47

> The appeal of the technocratic position, but also its weakness, is its seemingly frictionless value neutrality. Talk of “smart technology” and “smart regulatory frameworks” glides over the moral and political questions that make climate change a daunting and difﬁcult issue: What would it take to counter the outsize inﬂuence of the fossil fuel industry on democratic politics? Should we reconsider the consumerist attitudes that lead us to treat nature instrumentally, as a dumping ground for what Pope Francis has called our “throwaway culture”? 89  And what about those who oppose government action to reduce carbon emissions, not because they reject science, but because they do not trust government to act in their interest, especially in a large-scale reconﬁguration of the economy, and do not trust the technocratic elites who would design and implement this reconﬁguration?
> These are not scientiﬁc questions to be answered by experts. They are questions about power, morality, authority, and trust, which is to say they are questions for democratic citizens.

> But Young also glimpsed the dark side of meritocracy. Writing as if he were a historian looking back from the year 2033, he described with uncanny clarity the moral logic of the meritocratic society that was beginning to unfold in the postwar Britain of his day. Without defending the class-bound order that was passing, Young suggested that its moral arbitrariness and manifest unfairness at least had this desirable effect: It tempered the self-regard of the upper class and prevented the working class from viewing its subordinate status as personal failure.
> Those who were “catapulted” to the top by their parents’ riches and inﬂuence “could not say to themselves with complete conviction ‘I am the best man for the job’ because they knew that they had not won their place inopen competition and, if they were honest, had to recognize that a dozen of their subordinates would have been as good, or perhaps better.” 4

> What if the rhetoric of rising no longer inspires, not simply because social mobility has stalled but, more fundamentally, because helping people scramble up the ladder of success in a competitive meritocracy is a hollow political project that reﬂects an impoverished conception of citizenship and freedom? To explore this larger question, we need to examine two objections to meritocracy as a moral and political project. One is about justice; the other is about attitudes toward success and failure. The ﬁrst objection doubts that even a fully realized meritocracy, in which jobs and pay perfectly reﬂected people’s efforts and talents, would be a just society. The second objection worries that even if a meritocracy were fair, it would not be a good society. It would generate hubris and anxiety among the winners and humiliation and resentment among the losers—attitudes at odds with human ﬂourishing and corrosive of the common good.

> What matters for a meritocracy is that everyone has an equal chance to climb the ladder of success; it has nothing to say about how far apart the rungs on the ladder should be. The meritocratic ideal is not a remedy for inequality; it is a justiﬁcation of inequality.

> The same can be said of those who excel in pursuits our society values less highly. The world champion arm wrestler may be as good at arm wrestling as LeBron is at basketball. It is not his fault that, except for a few pub patrons, no one is willing to pay to watch him pin an opponent’s arm to the table. 15

> But the meritocratic argument is not mainly a sociological claim about the efﬁcacy of effort. It is above all a moral claim about human agency and freedom.

> Given his opposition to the redistribution of income, one might expect Hayek to insist that the free market gives people the economic rewards they deserve. But he does not. In fact, he argues that market outcomes have nothing to do with rewarding merit. They simply reﬂect the value consumers place on the goods and services sellers have to offer. Hayek draws a distinction between merit and value. Merit involves a moral judgment about what people deserve, whereas value is simply a measure of what consumers are willing to pay for this or that good. 20

- useful about people not paying for it

> Hayek is able to reply that, even if we consider the vocation of teaching to be more admirable than managing money, wages and salaries are not awards for good character or worthy achievement but simply payments that reﬂect the economic value of the goods and services market participants have to offer.

> “Even if it works to perfection in eliminating the inﬂuence of social contingencies,” Rawls argues, a fair meritocracy “still permits the distribution of wealth and income to be determined by the natural distribution of abilities and talents.” 24  Income inequalities due to natural talents are no more just than inequalities that arise from class differences. “From a moral standpoint the two seem equally arbitrary.” 25  So even a society that achieved true equality of opportunity would not necessarily be a just society. It would have also to contend with the inequalities that arise due to differences in people’s native abilities.

> Rather than handicap the talented, Rawls would have the winners share their winnings with those less fortunate than themselves. Don’t make the best runners wear lead shoes; let them run at full speed. But acknowledge in advance that the winnings do not belong to them alone. Encourage the gifted to cultivate and exercise their talents, but with the understanding that the rewards those talents reap in the market should be shared with the community as a whole.

> Rawls also points to widespread disagreement about merit and desert, and worries that basing justice on desert is at odds with freedom. Unlike Hayek, Rawls does not conceive freedom in market terms. For Rawls, freedom consists in pursuing our own conception of the good life while respecting the right of others to do the same. This means abiding by principles of justice that we and our fellow citizens would all agree to if each of us set aside our particular interests and advantages. Thinking about justice from this point of view—without knowing whether we would be rich or poor, strong or weak, healthy or unhealthy—would not lead us to afﬁrm whatever distribution of income resulted from the market. To the contrary, Rawls argues, it would lead us to accept only those inequalities that help the least-advantaged members of society.

> Morally and psychologically, the distinction between merit and value becomes vanishingly thin. This is especially true in market societies, where money is the measure of most things. In such societies, reminding the wealthy that their wealth reﬂects (only) the superior value of their contributions to society is an unlikely antidote to hubris and self-congratulation. And reminding the poor that their poverty reﬂects (only) theinferior value of their contributions is hardly a bracing tonic to their self-esteem.

> Serving market demand is simply a matter of satisfying whatever wants and desires people happen to have. But the ethical signiﬁcance of satisfying such wants depends on their moral worth. Evaluating their worth involves moral judgments, admittedly contestable, that economic analysis cannot provide. So even setting aside the question of talents, it is a mistake to assume that the money people make by catering to consumer preferences reﬂects merit or moral desert. Its ethical signiﬁcance depends on moral considerations that no economic model can supply. We cannot accept want-satisfaction as a ﬁnal criterion of value because we do not in fact regard our wants as ﬁnal; instead of resting in the view that there is no disputing about tastes, we dispute about them more than anything else; our most difﬁcult problem in valuation is the evaluation of our wants themselves and our most troublesome want is the desire for wants of the “right” kind. 44 Knight’s insight drives a wedge between two concepts that Hayek conﬂates—the value of an economic contribution as measured by the market and its actual value. 

> But even assuming the markets for casino moguls and health care providers are perfectly competitive, there is no reason to believe that their market value reﬂects the true value of their contributions to society. This is because the value of their contributions depends on the moral importance of the ends they serve, not on how effectively they satisfy consumer demand.

> Knight further argues that “the wants which an economic system operates to gratify are largely produced by the workings of the system itself.” The economic order does not simply satisfy pre-existing demand; “its activity extends to the formation and radical transformation, if not to the outright creation, of the wants themselves.” Any ethical assessment of an economic system must therefore consider “the kind of wants which it tends to generate or nourish,” not only its efﬁciency in satisfying “wants as they exist at any given time.” 45

> Satisfying consumer demand is not valuable in itself; its value depends, case by case, on the moral status of the ends it serves.

> On the face of it, Rawls’s non-meritocratic way of thinking about economic success should be humbling for the successful and consoling for the disadvantaged. It should restrain the tendency toward meritocratic hubris among elites and prevent the loss of self-esteem for those who lack power or wealth. If I truly believe my success is due to my good fortune rather than my own doing, I am more likely to feel an obligation to share this good fortune with others. These sentiments are in short supply these days. Humility among the successful is not a prominent feature of contemporary social and economic life. One impetus to populist backlash is a widespread sense among working people that elites look down on them. To the extent this is the case, it could simply show that the contemporary welfare state falls short of Rawls’s idea of a just society. Or it could suggest that egalitarian liberalism does not challenge the self-satisfaction of elites after all.

> It is certainly true that the contemporary welfare state, especially in the United States, does not live up to Rawls’s vision of a just society. Many of the inequalities of income and power we witness today do not arise from a system of fair equality of opportunity or work to the advantage of the least well-off. This leads liberals to interpret working-class resentment against elites as a complaint about injustice. If this is the only basis of anger against elites, the solution is to double down on the project of expanding opportunity and improving the economic prospects of the least well-off. But this is not the only way of interpreting the populist backlash against elites. The hubristic attitudes toward success that invite this backlash could well be fueled by the sense of entitlement that Rawls’s philosophy afﬁrms, even as it rejects moral desert. 


> Social esteem ﬂows, almost ineluctably, to those who enjoy economic and educational advantages, especially if they earn those advantages under fair terms of social cooperation. Liberals might reply that, provided all members of society are accorded equal respect as citizens, the allocation of social esteem is not a political matter. Deciding what abilities and achievements are worthy of admiration is a matter of social norms and personal values—a matter of the good, not the right. 55


> But it is folly to insist that the condescending attitudes of the credentialed, professional classes toward blue-collar workers is a matter of social norms that politics cannot or should not address. Questions of honor and recognition cannot be neatly separated from questions of distributive justice. This is especially true when it turns out that patronizing attitudes toward  the disadvantaged are implicit in the case for compensating them.


> On closer inspection, however, the luck egalitarian philosophy requires exacting judgments of merit and desert. Because it argues that people should be compensated only insofar as their misfortune is due to factors beyond their control, it conditions public assistance (for welfare, say, or health care) on whether a needy person is needy due to bad luck or bad choices. This requires policy makers to ﬁgure out who among the poor are victims of circumstance and hence deserving of help and who are responsible for their poverty and therefore undeserving. 59

> But helping the disadvantaged on the grounds that they are victims of circumstances beyond their control carries a high moral and civic price. It supports the disparaging view that welfare recipients have little to contribute and are incapable of acting responsibly. And as Anderson rightly observes, denying that those in need of public support can exercise meaningful choice is hard to reconcile with respecting them as equal citizens, capable of sharing in self-government. 64 In short, luck egalitarianism “offers no aid to those it labels irresponsible, and humiliating aid to those it labels innately inferior,” Anderson writes. “Like the Poor Law regime, it abandons those disadvantaged through their own choices to their miserable fates and deﬁnes the deserving disadvantaged in terms of their innate inferiority of talent, intelligence, ability, or social appeal.” 65

> Luck egalitarianism defends inequalities that arise from effort and choice.This highlights a point of convergence with free-market liberalism. Both emphasize personal responsibility and make the community’s obligation to help the needy conditional on showing that their neediness is no fault of their own. Luck egalitarians seek, by their own account, to defend the welfare state from free-market critics by accepting “the most powerful idea in the arsenal of the anti-egalitarian right: the idea of choice and responsibility.” 69  This reduces the disagreement between free-market and egalitarian liberals to a debate about the conditions under which a person’s choices can be considered truly free rather than burdened by circumstance or necessity.

> As Elizabeth Anderson observes, it is doubtful “that inferior native endowments have much to do with observed income inequalities in capitalist economies.” Most differences in income “are due to the fact that society has invested far more in developing some people’s talents than others and that it puts very unequal amounts of capital at the disposal of each worker. Productivity attaches mainly to work roles, not to individuals.”71

> By ﬁxating on natural talent as a primary source of income inequality, egalitarian liberals exaggerate its role and, inadvertently, enlarge its prestige.


> Meanwhile, the rich and the powerful, “insufferably smug,” were riding high. “If meritocrats believe, as more and more of them are encouraged to do, that their advancement comes from their own merits, they can feel they deserve whatever they can get.” As a result, “inequality has been becoming more grievous with every year that passes, and without a bleat from the leaders of the party who once spoke up so trenchantly and characteristically for greater equality.” 76 -- Michael Young


> Overcoming the tyranny of merit does not mean that merit should play no role in the allocation of jobs and social roles. Instead, it means rethinking the way we conceive success, questioning the meritocratic conceit that those on top have made it on their own. And it means challenging inequalities of wealth and esteem that are defended in the name of merit but that foster resentment, poison our politics, and drive us apart. Such rethinking should focus on the two domains of life most central to the meritocratic conception of success: education and work.


> [John W.] Gardner gamely argued that "achievement should not be confused with human worth" and that individuals were worthy of respect regardless of their achievements. But he seemed to understand that the meritocratic society he was helping bring about left little room for the distinction between educational achievement and social esteem. 54

## Chapter 6

>  Perfectionism is the emblematic meritocratic malady. At a time when young people are relentlessly “sorted, sifted, and ranked by schools, universities, and the workplace, neoliberal meritocracy places a strong need to strive, perform, and achieve at the center of modern life.” 76  Success or failure at meeting the demand to achieve comes to deﬁne one’s merit and self-worth. Chapter 6 The Sorting Machine: Wounded Winners, n.pag.

> In seeking to dismantle the sorting machine that Conant set in motion, it is worth noticing that the regime of merit exerts its tyranny in two directions at once. Among those who land on top, it induces anxiety, a debilitating perfectionism, and a meritocratic hubris that struggles to conceal a fragile self-esteem. Among those it leaves behind, it imposes a demoralizing, even humiliating sense of failure.
> These two tyrannies share a common moral source—the abiding meritocratic faith that we are, as individuals, wholly responsible for our fate: If we succeed, it is thanks to our own doing, and if we fail, we have no one to blame but ourselves. Inspiring though it seems, this strenuous notion of individual responsibility makes it hard to summon the sense of solidarity and mutual obligation that could equip us to contend with the rising inequality of our time.Chapter 6 The Sorting Machine: Hubris and Humiliation, n.pag.

> As early as 1960, when the number of applicants was less daunting, a longtime member of Yale’s admissions committee was quoted as saying, “You sometimes have the nasty feeling that you could take all the thousands of [applications] … and you could throw them down the stairs, pick up any thousand, and produce as good a class as the one that will come out of the committee meeting.” 84 Chapter 6 The Sorting Machine: A Lottery of the Qualified

Peter Stone, “Access to Higher Education by the Luck of the Draw,” Comparative Education Review 57, August 2013;

> But the most compelling reasons for a lottery of the qualiﬁed is to combat the tyranny of merit. Setting a threshold of qualiﬁcation and letting chance decide the rest would restore some sanity to the high school years, and relieve, at least to some extent, the soul-killing, résumé-stufﬁng, perfection-seeking experience they have become. It would also deﬂate meritocratic hubris, by making clear what is true in any case, that those who land on top do not make it on their own but owe their good fortune to family circumstance and native gifts that are morally akin to the luck of the draw.Chapter 6 The Sorting Machine: A Lottery of the Qualified

> Living by the belief that we have no hand in whether we will be saved in the next world or successful in this one is hard to reconcile with the idea of freedom and with the conviction that we get what we deserve. This is why merit tends to drive out grace; sooner or later, the successful assert, and come to believe, that their success is their own doing, and that those who lose out are less worthy than they. Chapter 6 The Sorting Machine: Chastening Merit’s Hubris

## Chapter 7

> Meritocratic sorting helped entrench this idea. So did the neoliberal, or market-oriented, version of globalization embraced by mainstream parties of the center-right and center-left since the 1980s. Even as globalization produced massive inequality, these two outlooks—the meritocratic and the neoliberal—narrowed the grounds for resisting it. They also undermined the dignity of work, fueling resentment of elites and political backlash. 
> Since 2016, pundits and scholars have debated the source of populist discontent. Is it about job loss and stagnant wages or cultural displacement? But this distinction is too sharply drawn. Work is both economic and cultural. It is a way of making a living and also a source of social recognition and esteem.
> This is why the inequality brought about by globalization produced such anger and resentment. Those left behind by globalization not only struggled while others prospered; they also sensed that the work they did was no longer a source of social esteem. In society’s eyes, and perhaps also their own, their work no longer signiﬁed a valued contribution to the common good. Chapter 7: Recognizing Work: Eroding The Dignity Of Work

> But giving up on work was not the most grievous expression of the damaged morale of working-class Americans. Many were giving up on life itself. The most tragic indication is the increase in “deaths of despair.” The term was coined by Anne Case and Angus Deaton, two Princeton economists who recently made a disquieting discovery. Throughout the twentieth century, as modern medicine pushed back disease, life expectancy steadily increased. But from 2014 to 2017, it stalled and even declined. For the ﬁrst time in a century, life expectancy in the United States decreased for three straight years.
> This was not because medical science stopped ﬁnding new cures and treatments for disease. Mortality rates were going up, Case and Deaton found, due to an epidemic of deaths caused by suicides, drug overdoses, and alcoholic liver disease. They called them “deaths of despair” because they were, in various ways, self-inﬂicted.
> Such deaths, which had been mounting for more than a decade, were especially frequent among white adults in middle age. For white men and women aged 45–54, deaths of despair increased threefold from 1990 to 2017. 9  By 2014, for the ﬁrst time, more people in this group were dying of drugs, alcohol, and suicide than from heart disease.Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Deaths Of Despair

> Something more than material deprivation was inciting the despair, something distinctive to the plight of people struggling to make their way in a meritocratic society without the credentials it honors and rewards. The deaths of despair, Case and Deaton conclude, “reﬂect a long-term and slowly unfolding loss of a way of life for the white, less educated working class.” Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Deaths Of Despair

> This condition sadly vindicates Michael Young’s observation that “in a society that makes so much of merit” it is hard “to be judged as having none. No underclass has ever been left as morally naked as that.” Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Deaths Of Despair

Quote from Young is here: <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment>

> Williams acknowledges that “economic resentment has fueled racial anxiety that, in some Trump supporters (and Trump himself), bleeds into open racism. But to write off white working-class anger as nothing more than racism is intellectual comfort food, and it is dangerous.” 24
> Barbara Ehrenreich, a journalist who writes about work and class, makes a similar observation. She quotes W. E. B. Du Bois, writing in 1935: “It must be remembered that the white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage.” Unlike African Americans, white working-class citizens were “admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best public schools.” 25  This “public and psychological wage” is what today goes by the name of “white privilege.” Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Sources Of Resentment

Link to Ehrenreich source here: <https://tomdispatch.com/barbara-ehrenreich-america-to-working-class-whites-drop-dead/>

> After the civil rights movement, the racial segregation that upheld this perverse psychological wage subsidy fell away, Ehrenreich suggests, leaving poor whites without “the comfort of knowing that someone was worse off and more despised than they were.” Liberal elites who “feel righteous in their disgust for lower-class white racism” are right to condemn the racism. 26  But they fail to see how attributing “white privilege” to disempowered white working-class men and women is galling; it ignores their struggle to win honor and recognition in a meritocratic order that has scant regard for the skills they have to offer. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Sources Of Resentment


> But the way a society honors and rewards work is central to the way it deﬁnes the common good. Thinking through the meaning of work would force us to confront moral and political questions we otherwise evade, but that lurk, unaddressed, beneath the surface of our present discontents: What counts as a valuable contribution to the common good, and what do we owe one another as citizens? Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Sources Of Resentment

> Economic concerns are not only about money in one’s pocket; they are also about how one’s role in the economy affects one’s standing in society. Those left behind by four decades of globalization and rising inequality were suffering from more than wage stagnation; they were experiencing what they feared was growing obsolescence. The society in which they lived no longer seemed to need the skills they had to offer.
> Robert F. Kennedy, seeking his party’s nomination for president in 1968, understood this. The pain of unemployment was not simply that the jobless lacked an income but that they were deprived of the opportunity to contribute to the common good. “Unemployment means having nothing to do—which means having nothing to do with the rest of us,” he explained. “To be without work, to be without use to one’s fellow citizens, is to be in truth the Invisible Man of whom Ralph Ellison wrote.”  Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Renewing The Dignity Of Work

> It falls to politics to reconcile our identities as consumers and as producers. But the globalization project sought to maximize economic growth, and hence the welfare of consumers, with little regard for the effect of outsourcing, immigration, and ﬁnancialization on the well-being of producers. The elites who presided over globalization not only failed to address the inequality it generated; they also failed to appreciate its corrosive effect on the dignity of work. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Renewing The Dignity Of Work

> While diminished purchasing power certainly matters, the injury that most animates the resentment of working people is to their status as producers. This injury is the combined effect of meritocratic sorting and market-driven globalization. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Work As Recognition

> A second approach rejects this consumerist notion of the common good in favor of what might be called a civic conception. According to the civic ideal, the common good is not simply about adding up preferences or maximizing consumer welfare. It is about reﬂecting critically on our preferences—ideally, elevating and improving them—so that we can live worthwhile and ﬂourishing lives. This cannot be achieved through economic activity alone. It requires deliberating with our fellow citizens about how to bring about a just and good society, one that cultivates civic virtue and enables us to reason together about the purposes worthy of our political community. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Work As Recognition

> In the twentieth century, the producer ethic of the republican tradition gradually gave way to consumerist notions of freedom, and to a political economy of economic growth. 42  But the idea that, even in a complex society, work draws citizens together in a scheme of contribution and mutual recognition did not disappear altogether. At times, it has found inspiring expression. Speaking to striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, shortly before he was assassinated, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., tied the dignity of sanitation workers to their contribution to the common good. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Work As Recognition
>> One day our society will come to respect the sanitation workers if it is to survive, for the person who picks up our garbage is in the ﬁnal analysis as signiﬁcant as the physician, for if he doesn’t do his job, diseases are rampant. All labor has dignity. 43 (Martin Luther King)

> The German social theorist Axel Honneth has argued that contemporary conﬂicts over the distribution of income and wealth can best be understood as conﬂicts over recognition and esteem. 46 Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Work As Recognition

> In short, Hegel argued that the capitalist organization of work emerging in his time could be ethically justiﬁed only on two conditions, described succinctly by Honneth: “ﬁrst, it must provide a minimum wage; second, it must give all work activities a shape that reveals them to be a contribution to the common good.” 47
> Eighty years later, the French social theorist Émile Durkheim built on Hegel’s account of work, arguing that the division of labor can be a source of social solidarity, provided everyone’s contribution is remunerated according to its real value for the community. 48  Unlike Smith, Keynes, and many present-day economists, Hegel and Durkheim did not see work mainly as a means to the end of consumption. Instead, they argued that work, at its best, is a socially integrating activity, an arena of recognition, a way of honoring our obligation to contribute to the common good.Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Work As Recognition

> People hold various views about what is important in life. We disagree about the meaning of human ﬂourishing. As consumers, we differ in our preferences and desires. In the face of these differences, maximizing consumer welfare seems a value-neutral goal for economic policy. If consumer welfare is the goal, then notwithstanding our disparate preferences, more is better than less. Disagreements inevitably arise about how to distribute the fruits of economic growth—hence the need for debates about distributive justice. But all can agree, or so it would seem, that expanding the economic pie is better than shrinking it.Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Contributive Justice
> Contributive justice, by contrast, is not neutral about human ﬂourishing or the best way to live. From Aristotle to the American republican tradition, from Hegel to Catholic social teaching, theories of contributive justice teach us that we are most fully human when we contribute to the common good and earn the esteem of our fellow citizens for the contributions we make. According to this tradition, the fundamental human need is to be needed by those with whom we share a common life. The dignity of work consists in exercising our abilities to answer such needs. If this is what it means to live a good life, then it is a mistake to conceive consumption as “the sole end and object of economic activity.” Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Contributive Justice
> A political economy concerned only with the size and distribution of GDP undermines the dignity of work and makes for an impoverished civic life. Robert F. Kennedy understood this: “Fellowship, community, shared patriotism—these essential values of our civilization do not come from just buying and consuming goods together.” They come instead from “digniﬁed employment at decent pay, the kind of employment that lets a man say to his community, to his family, to his country, and most important, to himself,‘I helped to build this country. I am a participant in its great public ventures.’” 49 Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Contributive Justice

> The dignity of work is a good place to start. On the surface, it is hardly a controversial ideal. No politician speaks against it. But a political agenda that takes work seriously—that treats it as an arena of recognition—would raise uncomfortable questions for mainstream liberals and conservatives alike. This is because it would challenge a premise that proponents of market-based globalization widely share—that market outcomes reﬂect the true social value of people’s contributions to the common good. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Debating The Dignity Of Work

> In a market society, however, it is hard to resist the tendency to confuse the money we make with the value of our contribution to the common good. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Debating The Dignity Of Work

> In 1984, as ﬁnancialization was starting to take off, James Tobin, the distinguished Yale economist, offered a prescient warning of the “casino aspect of our ﬁnancial markets.” He worried “that we are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into ﬁnancial activities remote from the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity.”  Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Debating The Dignity Of Work: Finance, Speculation, and the Common Good
> It is hard to know exactly what portion of ﬁnancial activity improves theproductive capacity of the real economy and what portion generates unproductive windfalls for the ﬁnancial industry itself. But Adair Turner, a credible authority, has estimated that in advanced economies such as the U.S. and U.K., only 15 percent of ﬁnancial ﬂows go into new productive enterprises rather than into speculation on existing assets or fancy derivatives. 62  Even if this underestimates by half the productive aspect of ﬁnance, it is a sobering ﬁgure. Its implications are not only economic but also moral and political. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Debating The Dignity Of Work: Finance, Speculation, and the Common Good

> A political agenda that recognizes the dignity of work would use the tax system to reconﬁgure the economy of esteem by discouraging speculation and honoring productive labor. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Debating The Dignity Of Work: Finance, Speculation, and the Common Good

> Taxation is not only a way of raisingrevenue; it is also a way of expressing a society’s judgment about what counts as a valuable contribution to the common good. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Debating The Dignity Of Work: Finance, Speculation, and the Common Good

> My broader point is that renewing the dignity of work requires that we contend with the moral questions underlying our economic arrangements, questions that the technocratic politics of recent decades have obscured. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Makers And Takers
> One such question is what kinds of work are worthy of recognition and esteem. Another is what we owe one another as citizens. These questions are connected. For we cannot determine what counts as a contribution worth afﬁrming without reasoning together about the purposes and ends of the common life we share. And we cannot deliberate about common purposes and ends without a sense of belonging, without seeing ourselves as members of a community to which we are indebted. Only insofar as we depend on others, and recognize our dependence, do we have reason to appreciate their contributions to our collective well-being. This requires a sense of community sufﬁciently robust to enable citizens to say, and to believe, that “we are all in this together”—not as a ritual incantation in times of crisis, but as a plausible description of our everyday lives. Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Makers And Takers
> Over the past four decades, market-driven globalization and the meritocratic conception of success, taken together, have unraveled these moral ties. Global supply chains, capital ﬂows, and the cosmopolitan identities they fostered made us less reliant on our fellow citizens, less grateful for the work they do, and less open to the claims of solidarity. Meritocratic sorting taught us that our success is our own doing, and so eroded our sense of indebtedness. We are now in the midst of the angry whirlwind this unraveling has produced. To renew the dignity of work, we must repair the social bonds the age of merit has undone.Chapter 7 Recognizing Work: Makers And Takers

## Conclusion

> A lively sense of the contingency of our lot can inspire a certain humility: “There, but for the grace of God, or the accident of birth, or the mystery of fate, go I.” Such humility is the beginning of the way back from the harsh ethic of success that drives us apart. It points beyond the tyranny of merit toward a less rancorous, more generous public life.  Conclusion: Merit and the Common Good: Democracy And Humility
