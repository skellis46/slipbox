# Bono - Surrender

_previous note:_

## Chapter 3: Iris (Hold Me Close)

> You’re no longer singing the song; the song is singing you. The journey away from self-consciousness is the most important journey for any performer to make; it is the hardest journey.

## Chaper 12: Sunday Bloody Sunday

> He was half serious in suggesting all countries were falsehoods—“They are stories we tell each other”—and he was suspicious of who controlled the narrative.

## Chapter 14: Bullet the Blue Sky

> I’ve slowly come to see that if we want to understand the forces we’re up against, then it helps to befriend the idea in opposition to the one you’re pursuing. Before you do battle with it.

## Chapter 20: One

> But some arrogance is essential to the creative process. The very idea that your private thoughts or feelings are worth sharing with anyone outside your family or friends is already a kind of arrogance.

## Chapter 21: The Fly

> Michael Leunig’s beautiful poem “Love and Fear”:

> There are only two feelings.
> Love and fear.
> There are only two languages.
> Love and fear.
> There are only two activities.
> Love and fear.

## Chapter 22: Even Better Than The Real Thing

> A hill that the philosopher Nietzsche used to climb, the man who wrote that for anything great to take place in your life, there has to be “long obedience in the same direction.”

## Chapter 25: Wake Up Dead Man

> In the art dictionary, you find that pop was about the death of God because if there’s no eternal, then we must live in the instant. But the job of art is making the instant eternal.
> There’s no contradiction.

## Chapter 26: The Showman

> Over the while I’ve understood that even showbiz is rooted in shamanism, that the most superficial of arts holds the memory of much older and deeper questions: immortality, the death and resurrection show. The pseudo-religious part of being a rock star, how we put the messy in messianic.

> It was reading Rogan P. Taylor’s The Death and Resurrection Show: From Shaman to Superstar when I understood that show business is not a branch of shamanism. It is shamanism. From pulling a rabbit out of a hat to the Indian rope trick to the pyro of the rock show, deep within us we have this need for a belief in magic and ritual and ceremony. We have some unconscious desire for performers to have an otherworldliness, to have traveled to that “other world.” We want to see through them. We want them to be our seers.

> It’s not a miracle or a trick.
> It’s both. And when it happens, everyone knows the transubstantiation has occurred. What is the shaman doing during the show? Apart from wrestling with the technical issues and whether I can hit those high notes? Apart from wondering if the house is sold out and the set list is right? When all that noise quietens, the moment I know a show is really working is when I feel that the song is singing me, rather than me singing the song.

> Question: What do you call a person who before the magic trick sees the rabbit being placed in the top hat and is still surprised when the rabbit is revealed?
> Answer: A magician.
> That’s the magic.

> A moment on the way to surrender.
> It’s the song’s instruction that matters most, the lyric and melody. If you obey the song, you will get to that place that all of us singers live for.
> The experience of being sung. The experience of not carrying the song but being carried by it.

## Chapter 29: Crumbs From Your Table

> As the conversation grew more heated, Harry [Belafonte] recalled how he turned to Martin Luther King, who he could tell was growing tired with the bitchin’ about Bobby Kennedy.
> “Martin slams his hand on the table to snap everyone out of it. ‘Does anyone here have anything positive to say about our new attorney general?’ ”
> “No, Martin, that’s what we’re telling you,” comes the reply. “There’s nothin’ good about this man; he’s an Irish redneck, got no time for the Black man’s struggle.”
> Dr. King, said Harry, had heard enough and adjourned the meeting. “Gentlemen, I’m releasing you into the world to find one positive thing to say about Bobby Kennedy, because that one positive thing will be the door through which our movement will have to pass.”

> The search for common ground starts with a search for higher ground. Even with your opponents. 

> Harry Belafonte hasn’t finished our lesson.
> “Years later,” he continues, “when Bobby Kennedy lay dying on the kitchen floor of a Los Angeles hotel, he’d become a civil rights hero. A leader, not a laggard, in our movement, and I ask myself to this day if we got him wrong in those early days. I’ll never know, but I still grieve his loss.”
> “So did you find it?” asks Bob [Geldof], raising the question we were both thinking. “When the meeting reconvened, did you find that one positive thing Dr. King was looking for?”
> “We did. Bobby was close to his bishop, who was in turn close to some of our clergy from the South. We found a door to move through.”

### George bush’s front, back, and side door

> We were inhabiting a space where it didn’t feel like we had much company, a space critics might dismiss as a compromised middle, but I imagined as a radical center. 

> We took it for granted that because the problems of global inequality were mostly created by the Northern Hemisphere, it fell to those of us in the north to solve them. I recognize now how arrogant this position was. I learned a little late the wisdom in a Senegalese proverb, “If you want to cut a man’s hair, be sure he is in the room.”

## Chapter 30: Miracle Drug

> Sister Anne deals with death by telling it off or holding its hand.

 > I noticed how often we brush over the details of people’s lives when such details are in fact our lives.

## Chapter 32: Ordinary Love

“imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life” – Simone Weil -- [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]] -- thinking of building on here re Damasio's consciousness, in relation to emotion, etc. That Weil's words describe my [[authentic movement]] experiences?? See also below re learning judgement but not being judged, and also King's "the fierce urgency of now" (also below). Perhaps though this is a different article about the nature of presence? Mostly closely linked to ideas about meta-awareness as depicted in Damasio The Feeling of What Happens.

## Chapter 33: City of Blinding Lights

> W. B. Yeats was there a hundred years ago in his poem “The Second Coming”: “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.”

## Chapter 34: Get Out of Your Own Way

> Paul [McGuinness] never bought that slacker stuff. He knew from personal experience that a film director didn’t just get up one morning and go make a movie. It’s a financial equation and an artistic equation and a logistical equation, a whole series of problems that have to be solved in order for the filmmaker to make their art. Cash. Culture. Collaboration. 

> Why would there be a tension between someone’s life in the material world and in the immaterial world? Art is not necessarily on a higher plane than business, and an artist is not a more sacred soul because they make art. Some of the most self-absorbed people I have met are artists (I’m one of them…), and some of the most selfless have been business leaders, trying to treat their employees with proper dignity.

> What works? That’s what I’m always asking. When whoever said the job of the artist is to describe the problem, not to solve it, I wasn’t paying attention. I want to be with the people who follow through and actually make things actually better. Actually. I like functionality.

> And it turns out the fight for justice comes down to boring words that don’t look good on a T-shirt.
> Competence.
> Governance.
> Transparency.
> Accountability.
> Words that bring transformation.
> The non-shouty words. The quiet words that turn the world right side up.

## Chapter 35: Every Breaking Wave

> Dishonesty keeps the door of the Warehouse of Songs firmly locked, the a-little-too-successful writer now under the false impression that all his or her thoughts are worth sharing. The key is lurking deeper, down in the depths of your spirit. More prosaically…what scares the shite out of you?

## Chapter 36: I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For

> If I mostly find religiosity annoying, right up at the top of the annoying is the pigheaded certainty of the devout without the doubt. Not just no room for doubt in the God they follow, but no doubt in their ability to decipher the holy tracts. No doubt their version of events is the right one.

> “I’m walking along a river with my best friend,” I said. “And everything is just as it should be. I have confidence in my footsteps; I feel I am learning judgment but not being judged. I can say anything I want. Sometimes there’s a reply; sometimes there’s not. It’s just a conversation between friends.”

> Instead, says the writer—maybe Solomon—these are the vanities of vanities. The best thing in life, he discovers, is to enjoy your work. To do what you love.

## Chapter 37: Love Is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way

> [Religion is] more likely a daily discipline, a daily surrender and rebirth. It’s more likely that church is not a place but a practice, and the practice becomes the place. There is no promised land. Only the promised journey, the pilgrimage. We search through the noise for signal, and we learn to ask better questions of ourselves and each other.

> The mystics tell us God is present in the present, what Dr. King described as “the fierce urgency of now.”

## Chapter 38: Moment of Surrender

> The moment of surrender is the moment you choose to lose control of your life, the split second of powerlessness where you trust that some kind of “higher power” better be in charge, because you certainly aren’t.

>  I hear the words of another Sufi, the poet Rumi.

> Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
> there is a field. I’ll meet you there.
> When the soul lies down in that grass,
> the world is too full to talk about.
