# Robert Vesty - Ten Days in Tarbena

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM summary: 

Robert Vesty’s chapter documents a ten-day improvisation project in the village of Tàrbena in Spain, framed as a durational, site-responsive practice rather than a discrete artwork. Working with a small group of dancers embedded in daily village life, Vesty treats improvisation as an ecological and social process, shaped by terrain, weather, architecture, rhythm of labour and informal encounters with residents. Improvisation here is not positioned as expressive freedom but as an attentive mode of dwelling – a way of listening to place through movement, repetition and time. The chapter foregrounds how extended duration shifts dancers’ perceptual habits, producing heightened sensitivity to subtle change rather than dramatic variation.

Conceptually, Vesty argues for improvisation as a relational practice that resists spectacle, authorship and extractive models of site-based work. The value of the project lies less in what is produced than in how dancers learn to remain with uncertainty, boredom and contingency, allowing movement to emerge from ongoing negotiation with environment and others. Improvisation becomes a practice of ethical attunement rather than innovation, emphasising care, responsibility and responsiveness. In this sense, the chapter contributes to improvisation discourse by reframing it as a form of situated research and lived practice, aligned with ecological thinking and slow methodologies rather than virtuosity or novelty.
