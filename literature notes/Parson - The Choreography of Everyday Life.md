# Parson - The Choreography of Everyday Life

_previous note:_


> And really, I say to Paul, our lives don't operate in a neat cause-and-effect narrative structure, the way we neatly pretzel our lives into these neat linear stories and then neatly defend ourselves against anything that defies our highly constructed neat narrative, and a telltale sign of this construct is that the story neatly holds a single meaning.[@parson-2022-choreography p.27]

- but what of narratives? Their hold. Making sense. 
- Don't be obvious or literal. Windmill blown piece 
- Obvious was cultured out of me. Quite a price to pay. Adding text was a way to help guide.  

> Now Paul tells Jack that he feels like he is turning against Homer, he says he is wondering about all this clarity of action, that it feels like it's denying him his own thoughts, and he can't help but compare it to the Old Testament, which is oblique and bizarre but paradoxically and inexplicably relatable- you can feel its meaning in your body, even though that meaning is not abundantly clear. I know what you mean, I say from the kitchen, every year in synagogue when I read the Old Testament, the stories sound vastly different than the last year. Even though the text is unchanged, you are different, and the world is different, and the text gracefully allows for these shifts, which brings up for me ... the triangle.
