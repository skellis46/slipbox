How can we achieve a positive outcome with each person we come in contact with if our scope is narrowed by self-interest?

You are just absorbing the music with your whole being as the music moves and changes. This is the interval of mental space that ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AQ3WOTQ&location=647))

> In Chinese, characters or pictograms communicate ideas and situations. The character for listening attentively consists of the characters for Ear, Standing Still, Ten, Eye, and Heart and Mind. According to Zen Master Dae Gak, this pictogram for listening attentively means, “When in stillness, one listens with the heart. The ear is worth ten eyes.” ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AQ3WOTQ&location=651))


> The goal in listening is to find the balance between focusing our attention and remaining open-minded and tolerant of different views. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AQ3WOTQ&location=679))

> Dr. Marshall Rosenberg, in his book Nonviolent Communication, tells how we find it difficult to separate observation of a situation, person, or thing from an evaluation. Rosenberg calls our tendencies to observe and judge at the same time “life-alienating communication.” ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AQ3WOTQ&location=759))

With your design visible only to yourself, describe the shapes and locations on the paper as clearly as possible.
