## Highlights

> epistemology, the area of philosophy concerned with understanding the nature of knowledge and belief. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhp6ymyqhjjdg9v5j9g0zxr))


> Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, history and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out.
>  Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhph05dd7nhja6h5s6g5mvm))


> Epistemology, therefore, is concerned with the justification of knowledge claims. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhphy6x341z10f84yyf3d7j))


> We imagine that the impressions we have about the world come to us unsullied and unfiltered. We think we have the capacity to see things just as they really are, and that it is others who have confused perceptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhppnykx770d0zpvcny14jm))


> Not only are we in the grip of a staggeringly complex array of [cognitive biases](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-power-prime/201107/cognitive-biases-vs-common-sense) and dispositions, but we are generally ignorant of their role in our thinking and [decision-making](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_asks_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions).

> One of the clearest ways to understand critical thinking is as applied epistemology. Issues such as the nature of logical [inference](https://www.thoughtco.com/inference-logic-term-1691165), why we should accept one line of reasoning over another, and how we understand the nature of evidence and its contribution to decision making, are all decidedly epistemic concerns.

> To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhptqvyx1aarm28rrpf3wk0))


> That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry.
>  The sincerity of one’s belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to “believe me” should not be rationally persuasive by themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhq355tsfc93d0zkkgqxxxv))
