# Timmermann - A neurophenomenological approach to non-ordinary states of consciousness

_previous note:_ [[non-ordinary states of consciousness]]

LLM:

This paper argues that to really understand altered states of consciousness such as psychedelic experiences we need to combine two kinds of evidence: careful first-person reports of what people actually experience and objective measurements of brain activity. Timmermann explains that neither neuroscience alone nor subjective description on its own is sufficient. Brain data can show patterns and correlations but cannot tell us what an experience feels like, while personal reports can be rich and precise but are often dismissed as unscientific. Neurophenomenology is proposed as a way to rigorously link these two domains so that lived experience is treated as legitimate data rather than noise or anecdote .

Using psychedelic research as a key example, the paper shows how structured interviews and phenomenological analysis can reveal consistent features of experiences such as ego dissolution, changes in time perception and altered sense of self, which can then be meaningfully related to changes in brain dynamics. The central claim is that consciousness research advances most when subjective experience is not reduced away but instead carefully described, trained and analysed alongside neural measures. This approach challenges the idea that consciousness can be fully explained at the neural level alone and instead frames it as something that must be studied across experiential and biological levels at the same time .
