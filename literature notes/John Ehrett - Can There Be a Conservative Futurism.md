## Highlights
- It’s hard to imagine a corporate motto that has aged more than Facebook’s old *Move fast and break things*, although Google’s *Don’t be evil* is a close second. The world did move fast, and many things were broken. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpje7t03nsxh230k0tkehv1g))
- The political right faces a particular challenge — and opportunity — for thinking constructively about the technological future. The challenge is that, to many in the conservative tradition, technological progress is often no progress at all, but merely leaves us more estranged from nature and from each other. Technological progress is in effect a move *away* from a divinely ordered cosmos. The opportunity is that conservatism has deep intellectual resources that can help to overcome this concern, while offering a constructive vision that may appeal to those outside the tradition.

- This anti-industrial impulse comes out of a deeper critique. For many intellectual traditionalists, the story of modern technology is a story of *war against givenness*. On this account, the modern technological mindset is born of a dissatisfaction with created reality as it is, manifesting as a perverse desire to bend the stuff of nature to human will. The critique was perhaps most famously formulated by Martin Heidegger, who [argued](https://monoskop.org/images/4/44/Heidegger_Martin_The_Question_Concerning_Technology_and_Other_Essays.pdf#page=49) in the 1950s that modern technology amounted to “a challenging [*Herausfordern*], which puts to nature the unreasonable demand that it supply energy that can be extracted and stored as such.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpjf2pk299n4yhp98rgdsnjh))
- Carl Trueman, a church historian and cultural critic, strikes a similar note in *The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self*, explaining that the modern mentality “sees the world as so much raw material out of which meaning and purpose can be created by the individual.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpjf3ns4rv19qh3xkm2w171g))
- But it is a critique that is far more persuasive in the halls of a university than in the public square. It is, after all, a critique that leaves the traditionalist open to the taunts of Enlightenment apologists like Steven Pinker or Yuval Noah Harari: *You’d take the world back to the Dark Ages, without medicine and electricity and running water. You’d condemn humanity to ignorance and rule by the strongest. Is this your “common good”?* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpjf52g00akvp5d52dexnxn1))
- But again, this view resonates with very few — and vanishingly few even of those are willing to trade civilization’s comforts for the deep-ecological radicalism of, say, a Paul Kingsnorth, or even the more modest agrarianism of a Wendell Berry. The retreat from time cannot, for most people, pose a serious alternative to today’s technological moment. And so conservatives seemingly find themselves caught in a dilemma: surrender limply to the currents of history, or insist in vain on returning to a past before humanity’s original industrial sin.

> Far more significant than Fedorov’s specific conclusions, though, is his method: an approach to technological advancement self-consciously anchored in an ancient tradition. His model is a dramatic counterexample to the notion that science *as such* must push traditional faith to the margins — the notion that Charles Taylor describes as the “subtraction story” of modernization. Rather, his work dissolves that harsh dualism: the active and contemplative Adams stand reconciled. The real question is how to repurpose that methodological insight.

> To begin with, the Internet and its derivative products need not be ignored, if that were possible, but rather should be brought into a social framework built in accordance with higher principles. To that end, Internet infrastructure — server and cloud hosting systems, payment transfer networks, and so forth — should be classified as public utilities, no more authorized to discriminate between users than are water or electric companies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpn0gk45cmzcmeh706ny0sjk))


> Rather, the accent here lies on the *public* in “public utility.” There is an implication of permanence: a public utility is a kind of technology intended to perdure, one that multiple generations will have a stake in stewarding responsibly.

> Where possible, policymakers should promote massive reinvestment in research and development in materials science, oriented to the goal of building things that last. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpn0jfn1568n57hamxpj7rex))


> Similarly, the discipline of computer science should reorient itself toward preservation over transformation and displacement. Enough things have been broken in the rush to move fast that it is now time for a different course. One pressing task is the development of data preservation technologies that resist disc rot and physical damage. As library scientist Marc Kosciejew observes in his call for “[Digital Vellum](https://tefkos.comminfo.rutgers.edu/Courses/e553/Articles/Articles%20Fall15/Kosciejew%20Digital%20%20rot%20-%20preservation%20Inf%20Mgmt%20J%202015.pdf)” to help ensure the long-term preservation of data, “books that are created on high-quality and acid-free paper can last for centuries,” whereas today’s electronic files easily just disappear.

> Conservatives have, in a sense, won the argument about Big Tech. The poisonous effects of Internet-centric culture and a screen-mediated world are now well known across partisan lines, and sooner or later a reckoning will come. What form it will take is unclear, but the writing is on the wall. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpn0qyvqswj4xqb78kngshk5))
