# Zoran Josipovic - Reflexivity gradient—Consciousness knowing itself

_previous note:_ [[consciousness-as-such]]

LLM: 
This paper argues that consciousness is not just something that has experiences, but something that can directly know itself. Josipovic calls this nondual awareness: a basic form of awareness that does not split experience into a subject who knows and an object that is known. In this view, awareness does not need thoughts, images, or concepts to recognise itself. It simply knows itself by being itself. Most of the time this self-knowing is implicit and unnoticed, but under certain conditions such as contemplative practice it can become explicit. When it does, people report qualities like presence, spaciousness, clarity, and a sense that experience is not divided into “me here” and “things out there” .

The paper also proposes a “reflexivity gradient” to explain different theories of self-awareness. At one end are views where consciousness knows itself indirectly, by representing itself as an object, for example “I am aware that I am aware.” At the other end is fully nondual reflexivity, where there is no distance at all between awareness and what is known. Josipovic argues that many philosophical and scientific accounts get stuck in the middle because they assume all knowing must be representational. Without recognising nondual awareness as foundational, reflexivity remains hard to explain. The key claim is that awareness itself is primary, and thoughts, perceptions, and self-reflections all occur within it rather than creating it .
