# five days with Janet Adler (film)

_previous note:_ [[authentic movement]]

- 05:20 "simple, elegant structure" of AM
- Adler was taught by Mary Whitehouse
- 06:55 as witness "may my presence be enough"
- 09:45 as witness "inviting him to see himself more clearly"
- 10:50 "clear seeing"
- 11:00 focus on not knowing as witness and mover (and on surrender (16:00ish))
- 16:00 "the subject object can become the same" -- [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]
- "the seer, the seen"; "the one who sees and the one who is being seen"
- 16:30 "consciousness of my inner witness"
- 19:40 "welcoming experiences of awe"
- 22:20 "each moment when we are fully present to what is arising"
	+ but talked about tears coming up
	+ how not to linger or attach to that moment? (and hence not be fully present to the flow of direct experience/consciousness)
- 22:50 "it's not about content" -- it's the "privilege of being immersed in process"
- 24:40 "direct experience is something that doesn't have anything to do with the conceptual mind ... it's closer to intuitive knowing ... direct knowing ... clear seeing"
- different from empathic response or empathy
- 26:20 three root system of authentic movement: dance, healing, mysticism
- 32:00 working toward "more clarity, toward less judgment, less projection, less interpretation"
