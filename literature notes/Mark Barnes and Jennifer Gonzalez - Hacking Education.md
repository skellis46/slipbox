## Highlights

> “Hackers don’t take realities of the world for granted; they seek to break and rebuild what they don’t like.” —Sarah Lacy, Author/Journalist ([Location 97](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012OZCREU&location=97))

> When software engineers develop new applications, they usually go through what’s known as a beta phase. When software is “in beta,” it has all of its basic parts, but is being user tested to work out the kinks and find the bugs. The beta concept can be applied to any new program, tool, or system; for best results, it should be applied to your hack as well. Instead of waiting for the perfect time to implement it, or waiting until you’ve done extensive training and practice and have everything in place, why not just try it? Launch it in beta and see how it goes. When problems arise, remind yourself that this new initiative is in beta; problems can and should be seen as opportunities to learn and improve.

> Taking an iterative approach is so much better than what we often see with education initiatives: We try it once, decide it doesn’t work, and abandon it. ([Location 173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012OZCREU&location=173))

> For every person who sniffs that an idea is “nothing new,” there are ten more who have never heard of it. It’s the variations, the iterations, that can make an old idea fresh again. ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B012OZCREU&location=193))
