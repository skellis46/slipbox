# Harris - Conscious

_previous note:_

> An organism is conscious if there is something that it is like to be that organism. 

from Thomas Nagel, “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?,” The Philosophical Review 83, no. 4 (1974): 435−50.

- Chalmers' _hard problem_ of consciousness asks "why and how humans have qualia or phenomenal experiences"[en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness)
- Nagel's definition (used by Chalmers) is synonymous with experience. And that the term consciousness itself is ambiguous: self consciousness, awareness, the state of being awake, etc.
- that wikipedia page is useful re list of those scientists who agree with hard problem (e.g. Varela) and those who don't (Dennett, Seth, Damasio)

Noting Harris's mention of umwelt ... elsewhere in my notes:
	+ [[Bridle - Ways of Being]]
	+ [[Ingold - Making]]

Harris mentions cognitive neuroscientist Anil Seth's idea that experiences of self are a form of 'controlled hallucination':

> Seth refers to our experiences of ourselves in the world as a kind of “controlled hallucination.” He describes the brain as a “prediction engine” and explains that “what we perceive is its best guess of what’s out there in the world.” In a sense, he says, “we predict ourselves into existence.”14 [@harris-2019-conscious Location 511]

- curious just how much this is akin to AI

- [[emergence]]

> The illusion of being a self, along with an experience of continuity over time through memory, may in fact be a very rare form of consciousness. [@harris-2019-conscious Location 912]
