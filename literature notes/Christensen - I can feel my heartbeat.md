#  Christensen - I can feel my heartbeat: Dancers have increased interoceptive accuracy

_previous note:_ [[interoception science overview]]

- interoceptive accuracy correlates positively with "measures of self-awareness and with attributes including emotional sensitivity, empathy, prosocial behavior, and efficient decision making"[@christensen-2018-can p.1]
- they use heartbeat perception task as tool to measure interoceptive accuracy (IAcc). 

> The few available studies that have sought to identify groups of individuals who may display higher IAcc have failed to demonstrate evidence of higher IAcc in groups where it might be expected due to expertise in the perception of bodily signals as a result of their specific training (e.g., in yoga practitioners and meditators, Daubenmier, Sze, Kerr, Kemeny, & Mehling, 2013; Farb, Segal, & Ander- son, 2013; Khalsa et al., 2008; Melloni et al., 2013). These groups show a higher interoceptive awareness (i.e., they know how good or bad they are at accurately estimating their heart rate), but not a higher interoceptive accuracy.[@christensen-2018-can p.2]

- this is fascinating -- why not in yoga practitioners? What kind of yoga? I can understand why not meditators (not conditioning sensitivity through movement)
- and what of interactions between interoceptive and proprioceptive expertise?

> interoception implies multisensory integration; it is a perceptual activity that integrates multiple signals from the body to one coherent percept of the state of the body.[@christensen-2018-can p.2]

- if multisensory what is gained from just measuring heart perception?

> Professional dancers showed a higher IAcc compared to control participants.[@christensen-2018-can p.9]

> we suggest that interoceptive accuracy may be acquired through engagement with any training involving both (a) elicitation of—and attention to—bodily signals (such as heartbeats, sweat response, muscle contraction), as well as (b) the use of these signals for the expression of states and emotions. These two aspects are common in musical and dance training. Moreover, the exploratory correlation between general art experience and IAcc might suggest a general effect also of visual arts training on IAcc.[p.9]

> Previous work has shown that dancers and other artists are better than controls at identifying emotional expressions in others and are more responsive to those expressions at the psychophysiological level (Christensen et al., 2016; Goldstein & Bloom, 2011; Goldstein & Winner, 2012; Lima & Castro, 2011).[p.10] 

> ... these models converge in suggesting that we understand the emotions, intentions, and states of both ourselves and of others through our own bodies (Damasio, 1999a; de Vignemont & Singer, 2006; Gallese, 2005; Gallese et al., 2004; Hurley, 2008; Niedenthal, 2007; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, & Gallese, 2001; Uddin, Iacoboni, Lange, & Keenan, 2007) through the perception of our own bodily sensations (Cameron, 2001; Craig, 2009; Critchley, 2009; Damasio, 1994, 1999b; Laird & Lacasse, 2014; Niedenthal, 2007). An enhancement of IAcc through arts training might thus increase desirable inter-personal attributes of emotional function.[p.10]

> We have suggested that dance training might enhance IAcc. However, it is equally possible that individuals with greater IAcc may respond better to dance training, and persist in this field longer due to their success. In other words, dance training may in fact do more to “weed out” individuals with lower interoception than to train interoception per se. The fact that we found an increase in IAcc between groups of increasing levels of dance training is a strong argument in favor of a training-based explanation of the group difference. However, longitudinal assessments will be required to establish this with certainty.[p.10]
