# Vanessa Lux - A Developmental Framework for Embodiment Research: The Next Step Toward Integrating Concepts and Methods

_previous note:_ [[embodiment is a theoretical construct]]

Embodiment has become a key concept in human life sciences in recent years. Although generally understood as the sum of bodily preconditions of cognition, emotion, and behavior, a closer look unveils that conceptualizations of embodiment vary strongly among research areas and theoretical schools: from embodied simulation to embodied cognition, from biological embedding of experience to interoception and the embodied mind. Differences also include types of knowledge production (e.g., cognitive processing models vs. motor developmental pathways vs. computational simulations of neural activity patterns), data modalities (e.g., self-reports vs. medical diagnoses vs. movement trajectories vs. molecular epigenetic profiles), and the involved levels of analysis (e.g., psychological function vs. gene expression). Different research areas and theoretical schools also account for different timescales across which embodiment processes can be analyzed (e.g., life-time effects vs. acute activation). Importantly, some of the most pressing topics with the greatest potential to advance embodiment research cut across research disciplines and are currently significantly hampered by the lack of a common theoretical framework that bridges the different conceptualizations of embodiment.

Finally, it *clarifies disciplinary boundaries* and finds connection points by identifying transmission hubs between the levels involved in a particular embodiment process which, then, creates links for collaboration between participating disciplines. This is especially important for research areas which try to overcome disciplinary limits but are still bound to the methods and committed to research standards within their respective field.

The rise of embodiment concepts in the life sciences started out in the 1980s, when linguists, cognitive psychologist, and robotic engineers turned to the study of motor and sensory processing, emphasizing that they shape the way our mind works. Neuroscience and philosophy of mind contributed to further advance this perspective (Varela et al., 1991); Gibbs, 2005; Shapiro, 2011). Subsequently, a range of different concepts developed by building up on the joint idea that our bodily preconditions are the foundation for the perception of ourselves (in the sense of consciousness and interoception) and the perception of the environment with which we interact, affecting a range of processes and phenomena related to e.g., cognition, emotion processing, social interaction, aesthetic perception, and mental health. We subsume these as agency approaches to embodiment (see Table 1).

In sports psychology and movement science, for example, the concepts of embodied cognition and embodied simulation bridged the gap between neurocognitive research and practical knowledge based on motor expertise, movement learning, as well as motor rehabilitation techniques

Further, the acknowledgment of the embeddedness of our mind within our most basal bodily functions via interoceptive pathways (see Craig, [2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B40), [2009a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B41),[b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B42)) and their influence on emotion processing, self-awareness, and time perception, strongly influenced research fields such as computational psychiatry and psychosomatics, and mental health research (Petzschner et al., [2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B161); Khalsa et al., [2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B106)).


Other attempts to classify embodiment approaches often distinguish a third group of phenomenological approaches (Overton, [2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B153)), or further differentiate along methods (experiential/objective), epistemological perspective (1st, 2nd, and 3rd third person perspective), and object of research (cognitive structure/practice) (Hornecker et al., [2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B96)). We subsume phenomenological approaches under the group of agency approaches, as these are also primarily concerned with the momentary preconditions of consciousness, action, or perception, although from a first (or second) person perspective.


In addition to different neural networks involved, e.g., in decision making, abstract word recognition, and movement execution, embodiment processes also encompass the physical constitution of the body (the anatomic structure of the limbs, homeostatic feedback processes, hormonal balance, basic sensory organization, and function, etc.), the neural networks involved in the regulation of these processes, and the molecular underpinnings of these regulation processes and network constitutions. This broader notion of embodiment further includes the focus on the anatomic structure of the body used in robotics (see Pfeifer and Bongard, [2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B163)), the notion of an extended mind to our immediate environment and, most importantly, intersubjectivity emphasized in phenomenological accounts (see Fuchs, [2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B66)), as well as the biological embedding of experiences across the lifespan (see Rutter, [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B183)).


Selfhood and emotions have long been understood to be grounded in representations of the physiological state of the body (James, [1994](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B103); Damasio, [1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B49); Critchley et al., [2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B44); Craig, [2009b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B42); Seth, [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B192)). More recently, research into interoception has demonstrated the extensive significance of our inner bodily signaling systems for decision making, time perception, emotion processing, and behavior in general (for review, see, e.g., Herbert and Pollatos, [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B92); Seth, [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B192)). Consequently, for disorders that involve disturbances of self-representations (e.g., psychosis), emotional processing (e.g., alexithymia, anxiety and mood disorders), or with strong somatic components (e.g., depression and eating disorders), a primary dysfunction in the perception and regulation of body states has been considered (Paulus and Stein, [2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B158); Herbert and Pollatos, [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B92); Stephan et al., [2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B201); Petzschner et al., [2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B161); Khalsa et al., [2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360894/#B106)).


> We propose to differentiate between at least seven levels of embodiment (see Table 3): The genetic and epigenetic activity level (1), the level of cell metabolisms (including proteomics analyses) and single neuronal activity (2), the level of neural connectivity patterns and physiological feedback mechanisms (e.g., hormonal, metabolism related) (3), the sensory and motor activity level (4), the level of integrative sensations, (intero)perception, and discrimination (5), the level of complex psychological functions, psychiatric symptoms, and behavior (6), and the level of social and cultural interactions (7). The number of levels and their distinction are not exclusive. We explicitly encourage understanding them as to be open to adaptations depending on their worth for the respective empirical study and the development of new methods. ^440e35
