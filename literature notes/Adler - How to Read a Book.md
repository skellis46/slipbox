# Adler - How to Read a Book

_previous note:_ 

---

Adler's classic text on reading. There are four levels of reading, and each is 

Aided and unaided discovery. 
Higher levels includes lower levels.

1. _Elementary Reading_

Passed through four stages of development: reading readiness, word mastery, vocabulary growth and using context, can read almost anything

2. _Inspectional Reading_

Emphasis on time. Act of skimming systematically and actively.

**Inspectional Reading 1: **

 1. Look at title page and preface
 2. Study ToC
 3. Check Index -- any crucial terms? 
 4. Read publisher's blurb. At this stage might have enough information to determine what kind of attention/reading to give the book
 5. Look at chapters pivotal to argument -- any summary statements in opening/closing pages? 
 6. Dip in here and there, paragraph or two, a few pages (never more); must read last few pages.

**Inspectional Reading 2:**
		
3. _Analytical Reading_
4. _Syntopical Reading_
