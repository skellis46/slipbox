>But we are also in danger of squandering this cognitive surplus on the trivial pursuit of the immediately relevant over any continuance of the innovation that got us to this point.

- thinking about CHOR and role of historical community of practice 



> Storytelling became an acknowledged cultural value in itself. In front of millions of rapt television viewers, mythologist Joseph Campbell taught PBS’s Bill Moyers how stories provide the fundamental architecture for human civilization. These broadcasts on The Power of Myth inspired filmmakers, admen, and management theorists alike to incorporate the tenets of good storytelling into their most basic frameworks. Even brain scientists came to agree that narrativity amounted to an essential component of cognitive organization. As Case Western Reserve University researcher Mark Turner concluded: “Narrative imagining—story—is the fundamental instrument of thought. Rational capacities depend upon it. It is our chief means of looking into the future, of predicting, of planning, and of explaining.”1 Or as science fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin observed, “The story—from Rapunzel to War and Peace—is one of the basic tools invented by the human mind, for the purpose of gaining understanding. There have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories.”2

> These events and inventions, and others, were promising so much change, so fast, that Alvin Toffler was motivated to write his seminal essay “The Future as a Way of Life,” in which he coined the term “future shock”:
> We can anticipate volcanic dislocations, twists and reversals, not merely in our social structure, but also in our hierarchy of values and in the way individuals perceive and conceive reality. Such massive changes, coming with increasing velocity, will disorient, bewilder, and crush many people. . . . Even the most educated people today operate on the assumption that society is relatively static. At best they attempt to plan by making simple straight-line projects of present-day trends. The result is unreadiness to meet the future when it arrives. In short, future shock.3

> Aristotle was the first, but certainly not the last, to identify the main parts of this kind of story, and he analyzed them as if he were a hacker reverse-engineering the function of a computer program. The story mechanics he discovered are very important for us to understand, as they are still in use by governments, corporations, religions, and educators today as they attempt to teach us and influence our behaviors. They are all the more important for the way they have ceased to work on members of a society who have gained the ability to resist their spell. This has put the storytellers into present shock.

>As Zadie Smith, author of White Teeth, explained in an interview, it is no longer the writer’s job to “tell us how somebody felt about something, it is to tell us how the world works.”9 Like other contemporary authors, such as Don DeLillo, Jonathan Lethem, and David Foster Wallace, Smith is less concerned with character arcs than with what she calls “problem solving.” Just like the worlds of television’s Lost or Heroes, the worlds of DeLillo’s White Noise and Lethem’s Chronic City are like giant operating systems whose codes and intentions are unknown to the people living inside them. Characters must learn how their universes work. Narrativity is replaced by something more like putting together a puzzle by making connections and recognizing patterns.

>But stories cannot truly come to the rescue of people who no longer have the time or trust required to respond to narrativity. What if stories themselves are incompatible with a presentist culture? How then do we maintain a sense of purpose and meaning? Moreover, how do we deal with the trauma of having lost these stories in the first place

> All we presentists get from zooming out to ten-thousand-year time spans is vertigo.[@rushkoff-2013-present]

>Although religious historian James Carse came up with the concept of “infinite games” well before computer games had overtaken television, music, and movies as our dominant entertainment industry, his two categories of play help explain why electronic gaming would gain such favor in an era of present shock. Finite games are those with fixed endings—winners and losers. Most every game from tennis to football works this way. Victory is the scarcity: there can be only one winner, so players compete for the win. Infinite games, on the other hand, are more about the play itself. They do not have a knowable beginning or ending, and players attempt to keep the game going simply for the sake of the play. There are no boundaries, and rules can change as the game continues. Carse’s point is to promote the open-ended, abundant thinking of infinite games. Instead of competing against one another and aching for the finality of conclusion, we should be playing with one another in order to maximize the fun for all. Instead of yearning for victory and the death of finite games, we should be actively enjoying the present and trying to sustain the playability of the moment. It’s an approach that favors improvisation over fixed rules, internal sensibilities over imposed morals, and playfulness over seriousness.
> While there is no such thing as a perfectly infinite game (except maybe for life itself), there are many increasingly popular forms of play that point the way to Carse’s ideal. 

>Time in the digital era is no longer linear but disembodied and associative. The past is not something behind us on the timeline but dispersed through the sea of information. Like a digital unconscious, the raw data sits forgotten unless accessed by a program in the future. Everything is recorded, yet almost none of it feels truly accessible. A change in file format renders decades of stored files unusable, while a silly, forgotten Facebook comment we wrote when drunk can resurface at a job interview.

>Some of this activity happens so self-consciously that it amounts to what digital-arts theorists call the New Aesthetic of everything from drone photography and ubiquitous surveillance to 8-bit game nostalgia and pixilated herringbone fabric. It is a blending of the language of digital technology with that of the physical world, perhaps best exemplified by the most advanced form of dubstep dancing, called glitch. Taking up where robot dancers and pop-and-lockers left off, glitch dancers imitate the glitchy stutter of low-resolution video streaming over the Internet. Their movements imitate those of a dancer as rendered by a malfunctioning video device, complete with dropouts and stutters.

- he's referring to Bridle's talk which I mention in [[parametricism]]; [@bridle-2011-new]

>Digital time ignores nearly every feature of kairos, but in doing so may offer us the opportunity to recognize kairos by its very absence. Clocks initially disconnected us from organic time by creating a metaphor to replace it. Digital time is one step further removed, replacing what it was we meant by “time” altogether. It’s a progression akin to what postmodern philosopher Jean Baudrillard called the “precession of the simulacra.” There is the real world, then there are the metaphors and maps we use to represent that world, and then there is yet another level of activity that can occur on those maps—utterly disconnected from the original. This happens because we have grown to treat the maps and symbols we have created as if they were the underlying reality. Likewise, we started with this amorphous experience of rhythms that we called time. We created the analog clock to represent the aspects of time we could represent with a technology. Then, with digital readouts, we created a way of representing what was happening on that clock face. It is twice removed from the original.

>Scientist Freeman Dyson attempted to clarify this for us when he came up with the concept of temporal diversity. As he came to realize, the survival of a species depends on adaptation and learning on six distinct timescales. On the shortest, most immediate scale, species must exist from year to year. The unit of survival for this year-to-year existence is the individual life form. Over decades, the unit of survival is the family, whose multiple generations last much longer than any single individual’s life span. Over centuries, it’s the tribe or nation. Over millennia, it is an entire culture. Over tens of millennia, it is the species itself, slowly evolving or surrendering to an evolved competitor. And over eons, the unit of survival is “the whole web of life of our planet.”2 Human beings have endured as a result of our ability to adapt on all six scales of being and to balance the conflicting demands of each.


>Former Merry Prankster and Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand applied temporal diversity to different levels of society. In his book The Clock of the Long Now, he argues that we live in a world with multiple timescales, all moving simultaneously but at different speeds. Brand calls it the order of civilization. Nature, or geological time, moves the slowest—like the skater in the middle of the pinwheel. This is the rate at which glaciers carve out canyons or species evolve gills and wings—over eons. On the next level is culture, such as that of the Chinese or the Jews—which lasts millennia. On the next concentric ring comes governance—the rather long-lasting systems of monarchies and republics. The next level is infrastructure—the roads and utilities those governments build and rebuild. Faster yet is commerce that occurs through that infrastructure. And finally the outermost ring is that of fashion—the ever-changing styles and whims that keep the wheels of commerce fed.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding: The Short Forever, n.pag.]

>For Brand, the solution is to expand our awareness of the larger, slower cycles. He is working with inventor Danny Hillis to build a 10,000-year clock—a clock of the “long now” that changes our orientation to time. His hope is that by beholding this tremendous time-keeping structure in the desert (itself the product of a multigenerational effort), we will be able to experience or at least perceive the bigger cycles that evade us in our daily schedules. In addition, instead of writing our years with four digits, Brand encourages us to use five, as in 02020 instead of 2020, keeping us aware of the much larger timescales on which important activity is still occurring. We could still operate on the timescale of the seasonally changing fashions or TV schedules while remaining cognizant of the greater cycles binding humanity to the cosmos.[@rushkoff-2013-present n.pag.]^1394a7

>As I argued in my book Life Inc., the Great Exhibition’s primary intent was to distract the domestic public from the dark underbelly of international industrial modernity. Through this spectacle, Queen Victoria and the corporations she sponsored disconnected these technologies from the human toll they inflicted on their operators. As if in a shopping mall, people gawked, their jaws dropping, at the steam pipes and gears, utterly unaware of the faces and hands the machines burned and mauled. People saw products and production, but never the producers themselves. If anything, industrial modernity was simpler and cleaner than manual labor. As much a welcome step back as a daring leap forward.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 3 Overwinding The Short Forever: Act Now, n.pag.]

- thinking here about me gawking. I didn't want to spend too long gawking, and yet I also sense how their dancing and indeed joy distracted me from the profound choreography of the situation. This is choreography of the kind in which the screen-phone ... Unaware they are burned and mauled (unknown to them). (early note for [[Lithium dancing]])


> Those same mathematicians and their successors are now being employed by Wall Street firms to hide from and predict one another’s movements. When a bank wants to move a big quantity of shares, for example, it doesn’t want everyone to know what it is doing. If news of a big buy leaked out before the big buy could be completed, the price may go up. To hide their motions, they employ the same technique as stealth planes: they use algorithms to break their giant trade into thousands of little ones, and do so in such a way that they look random. Their sizes and timing are scattered.
> In order to identify this stealthy algorithmic movement, competing banks hire other mathematicians to write other algorithms that monitor trading and look for clues of these bigger trades and trends. The algorithms actually shoot out little trades, much like radar, in order to measure the response of the market and then infer if there are any big movements going on. The original algorithms are, in turn, on the lookout for these little probes and attempt to run additional countermoves and fakes. This algorithmic dance—what is known as black box trading—accounts for over 70 percent of Wall Street trading activity today.

> Current battery technology is not only inadequate to the job, it also requires the mining of rare earth metals such as lithium and molybdenum, which are as easy to deplete as oil. We end up weaning our cars off oil only to make them dependent on other even more leveraged and scarce battery materials. 

Thinking about storage and lithium. Unsustainable. But that's hardware based thinking. Yet the software needs the hardware to run. To be executed, and interacted with. 

> We see new forms of spring-loading occurring across many different sectors of society, particularly as we move into increasingly digital spaces. Joichi Ito, Internet entrepreneur and director of MIT’s Media Lab, for example, believes that the development cycle of new technologies needs to be compressed. The formerly distinct processes of prototyping a product and releasing it onto the net have become the same thing. Arguing for flow over deliberation, Ito explains, “It is now usually cheaper to just try something than to sit around and try to figure out whether to try something. The product map is now often more complex and more expensive to create than trying to figure it out as you go. The compass has replaced the map.”39 In other words, instead of researching the market, prototyping a product, testing it, and then building a real version later, the developer compresses these processes into a single flow—planning, building, testing, and releasing simultaneously. It’s the Tao of unwinding the past while winding the future, all in the same present.

- see [[map and territory]] and Ito's thinking re the compass. 

> As political scientist Robert Axelrod explains it, once “the shadow of the future”40 lengthens, we have the basis for more durable relationships.
- connects my long now thinking with different kinds of relationships 
- but Rushkoff proposes something different:

> Inconvenient truths tend to create more anxious neurotics than they do enlightened stakeholders. Those most successfully navigating the short forever seem to be the ones who learn to think wider, not longer. We must be able to expand our awareness beyond the zero-sum game of individual self-interest. It’s not the longer time horizon that matters so much to alleviating our present shock as it is our awareness of all the other prisoners in the same dilemma. This is why the commons offers us not only the justification for transcending self-interested behavior but also the means to mitigating the anxiety of the short forever. The greater community becomes the way we bank our time and experience.

- breadth not length

> The way to move beyond the paralyzing effects of the short forever is to stop trying to look so far into the individual futures of people or businesses, and instead to become more aware of what connects them to everyone and everything else right now.

- what is my role in this exchange? (with the [[Lithium dancing]]) Who am I to them? How are we connected? What is this ecosystem? 

## Chapter 4: Fractalnoia

> Applied to the stock market or to consumer behavior, fractals may tell less about those systems than about the people searching for patterns within them.
> There is a dual nature to fractals: They orient us while at the same time challenging our sense of scale and appropriateness. They offer us access to the underlying patterns of complex systems while at the same time tempting us to look for patterns where none exist. This makes them a terrific icon for the sort of pattern recognition associated with present shock—a syndrome we’ll call fractalnoia. Like the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000, we engage by relating one thing to another, even when the relationship is forced or imagined. 

### To Be Or Not To Be

> The artists are the geeks, and the programmers are the performers. The programmers conceive and create with abandon. The artists try to imagine what humans may want to do with these creations, as well as what these creations may want to do with us.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 4: Fractalnoia -- To Be Or Not To Be, n.pag]

- spot on. 

> While I strongly advocate the teaching of computer programming to kids in grade school, I am just as much a believer in teaching kids how to think critically about the programmed environments in which they will be spending so much of their time. The former is engineering; the latter is liberal arts. The engineers write and launch the equations; the liberal artists must judge their usefulness, recognize the patterns they create, and—oh so very carefully—generalize from there. For the artist—the human, if you will—this care comes less from the accumulation of more and more specific data than the fine-tuning of the perceptual apparatus. In a fractal, it’s not how much you see, but how well you see it.

- one story does not make a pattern, but wanting to look closely. And generalise is just like proposing. 
- Lost in the Meritocracy

> When we focus on the pieces, we are working in what could be considered the timescape of chronos: we break objects down into their parts, study them carefully, focus in, and engage with the pieces scientifically. Like dissection, it works best when the subjects are dead. When we focus on the space around the pieces, we have shifted to the time sensibility of kairos. The space between things matters more than the things themselves. We are thinking less about tinkering with particular objects than about recognizing or influencing the patterns they create and the connections they make. We stop getting dizzy following the path of every feedback loop and pull back to see the patterns those loops create.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 4: Fractalnoia -- To Be Or Not To Be, n.pag]

> At best, the human body is a space suit for something that could be stored quite differently.

> Where it gets discomfiting, however, is when Kelly insists on technology’s all-consuming nature. “It is an ever-elaborate tool that we wield and continually update to improve our world; and it is an ever-ripening superorganism, of which we are but a part, that is following a direction beyond our own making. Humans are both master and slave to the technium [his word for the technological universe], and our fate is to remain in this uncomfortable dual role.”4

From Kelly's What Technology Wants

> There is no way back, only through. Kelly admonishes us to “align ourselves with the imperative of the technium” because to do otherwise would be to “resist our second self.”5 Humanity and technology—like humanity and the zombies—are ultimately indistinguishable. “The conflict that the technium triggers in our hearts is due to our refusal to accept our nature—the truth is that we are continuous with the machines we create. . . . When we reject technology as a whole, it is a brand of self-hatred.”6

> In the apocalyptic scenario, we are either to hope for benevolence when our creation overtakes us or to negotiate with technology now in order to get some of what we want along with what it wants. As I have come to understand technology, however, it wants only whatever we program into it. I am much less concerned with whatever it is technology may be doing to people than what people are choosing to do to one another through technology. Facebook’s reduction of people to predictively modeled profiles and investment banking’s convolution of the marketplace into an algorithmic battleground were not the choices of machines but of humans.
