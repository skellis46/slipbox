#  Beckman - on Postman's Technopoly

> The end was nourishment in food, and the means was hunting. The projectile point and its specific means of deliver (whether atlatl or, later, bow and arrow) was a specific development of means-as-hunting to the end-of-food. The overarching concept of means-ends remains in the human being, and the tool is merely brought in as a partial fulfillment of means. In this "primitive" form of technology, tool-making has not been alienated from its overarching human foundation within human culture and the human's intellectual and moral life. Tool-using technology is obviously run by the creation and execution of "vital interests," as the philosopher Jose Ortega y Gassett ("Man the Technician") called them. Tools are helpmates in the cultural process of humans inventing modes of human dwelling.

> Technocracy is not at all where things come to an end, according to Postman. Technocracy has steadily given way to what he calls technopoly. In the age of technopoly, technology is not merely the dominant factor within culture; rather technology seeks to redefine culture itself. This represents the ultimate alienation of technology from its human basis. That is, so long as humans create culture and therein formulate and modify and seek various ends, technology functions as a means to those ends, hence, a factor of culture subordinate to human design. If technology itself succeeds in redefining culture, human life and human design come to be driven by technology. Technology becomes the "author" of ends, and humans become means to those ends. This, clearly, is the same point that Heidegger's philosophy carries us toward. It is also the product of the dangerous situation that Ortega described. Where technology assumes the powerful position of omnipotence, humans lose access to any clear conception of their own vital interests. The whole process comes to be driven by technology itself and humans are alienated to a subordinate role where they no longer shape their own lives. Technopoly is what Postman calls "totalitarian technology." Technopoly proceeds to redefine what all the other features of culture can mean to us.

> That is, technopoly has elevated the concept of information as preeminent and, as the sole dispenser of information, acquired the power to control the destiny of an information-dependent culture as a whole. As Postman observes, technopoly has succeeded in redefining "knowledge" and "reason" into something more like "information" and "familiarity." It is only when we reflect on this (something that technopoly never wants us to do!) that we realize the extent to which knowledge and information are different. (We can have all kinds of information about someone or something, for instance, and still know very little.) Postman highlights the differences by asking us to consider how many of the conflicts, problems, or issues that we know about in the world could actually be solved by simply having more information.

> children are showered with information coming at them from all sides; it is a truly staggering world in which the humane realm of ends and means (what Ortega called "vital interests") is diluted beyond recognition.

- book with Finn about information?


> So long as we can accept it all as "progress," then we are discouraged from taking any critical look at what has happened. The cult of progress goes hand in hand with the cult of technology in advancing the regime of technopoly.
