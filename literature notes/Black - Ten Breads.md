# One Dough, Ten Breads Making Great Bread by Hand by Sarah Black

Advanced Bread and Pastry, by Michel Suas, the founder of the San Francisco Baking Institute, and Bread: A Baker’s Book of Techniques and Recipes, by King Arthur bakery director Jeffrey Hamelman in Vermont, are required reading for a successful professional baking experience.


Taste a bread before it has cooled and the crumb will collapse and feel gummy in your mouth. When bread has cooled properly, the integrity of both the crumb and the crust remain intact and the texture is enlivened. It is after a bread has settled that you can smell its true aroma and taste its true flavor.


A baking sheet that measures 18 by 13 inches, sometimes called a half sheet tray, and of black steel or thick aluminum construction, will be one of the most useful tools you will ever buy and should last a lifetime. Most often, you will bake breads directly on the baking sheet; it can also be used as a surface for proofing dough. If you are baking on a baking stone (see below), you can use an inverted baking sheet as a shuttle for sliding the dough onto the stone in the oven.


Finally, once the bread has finished baking, the moisture from the interior migrates to the crust; and once the bread cools, the dough settles and the flavors meld.


Breads made with 100 percent whole wheat flour can be heavier than white breads, as the gluten strands, which form a web for the leavening process that expands during fermentation, are cut by the sharp edges of the whole wheat bran flakes. For this reason, many whole wheat breads are strengthened with the addition of some white bread flour. Whole wheat flours also sometimes absorb more water than white flour, which means you may need to add more water to your whole wheat dough.


Simply put, yeast is the leavener of dough. It is a single-celled fungus that feeds on the sugar in flour and expels carbon dioxide in the process. This is the reason your bread rises.


There are four types of yeast to choose from, all strains of the same species, called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Saccharomyces comes from Greek and means “sugar mold.” Cerevisiae comes from Latin and means “of beer”; this yeast is also one of the yeasts used in fermenting beer.


The root word auto relates loosely to “self” or “same,” and the root word lyse means to “destruct” or “break down,” and that is what happens during the autolyse period. Enzymes in the flour break down the newly formed but chaotically grouped gluten strands so that the protein bonds can then be rebuilt into an orderly pattern, resulting in a stronger matrix.


Fermentation occurs when enzymes break down the starches in the flour into simple sugars; the sugars are metabolized by the yeasts and are then converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide gas expands within the web of gluten, creating and filling the air pockets in the dough and causing the dough to rise; the alcohol evaporates during baking.


A darker crust signifies more flavor than a lighter one, as the flavor from the crust diffuses into the interior of the bread.


Even though the bread is out of the oven, the baking process continues for the next hour. During this time, the interior moisture is migrating to the crust. The bread must be cooled on a wire rack out of the pan, so that air can flow around the entirety of the bread. Not until it has cooled completely will the bread reveal its true flavor and texture.


Batard From the French, meaning “bastard.” The batard is the baguette’s fall from grace, a “bastardized” version of the baguette. Broader, thicker, and stubbier than its ballerina-esque counterpart, what it lacks in looks it makes up for in practicality—it is more generous in volume, is easier to carry, and holds up in a sandwich.

A preferment also has practical applications beyond flavor: It adds extensibility to the dough, it strengthens the gluten, and it lengthens the shelf life of the bread.


This regard for farming and the land is a passion that has been embraced in the last few years by many bakers and chefs who are more and more educated about how the grain cultivars, soil, climate, farmer, and miller all impact good bread. Dan Barber writes extensively about these ideas in his book The Third Plate, as does Amy Halloran in her book, The New Bread Basket.
