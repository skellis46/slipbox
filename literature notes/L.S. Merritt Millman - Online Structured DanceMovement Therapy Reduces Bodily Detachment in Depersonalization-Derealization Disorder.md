## Highlights

> DMT or creative movement can have a positive impact on health and
>  wellbeing in both physical and mental health conditions including de­
>  mentia, Parkinson’s disease, and depression [1], with a core feature of
>  DMT being the observation of ones’ own body and attending to physi­
>  ological signals and physical boundaries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2daak5j30z6x9zs9mcs9zxh))


> Experiences of disembodiment and detachment from one’s body in
>  DDD may partly reflect altered [17] or deficient [18–20] interoceptive
>  processing. Interoception is a sense of awareness of one’s own body and
>  its internal states and sensations [21] and encompasses dissociable di­
>  mensions of accuracy, awareness, and sensibility [22]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dab7k7key5g8xahrxf83x3))


> The body awareness (BA) task, rooted in principles of body scanning and
>  somatic practices, explicitly directs attention towards the body, whereas
>  the dance exercise (DE) task, focused on aerobic physical dance move­
>  ment, implicitly boosts the salience of bodily signals. We were interested
>  in determining, in the context of DDD, if it is more effective to explicitly
>  focus on bodily sensations, or to implicitly enhance the salience of
>  bodily signals through dance-based exercise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2daks7h3z74v2a2th4m48ta))


> Finally, the use of two
>  dance tasks, instead of one dance task and a no-intervention control
>  group, allows us to control for the influence of physical exercise [1,39]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dap9v7fygr18cjmpdwqpaj))


> Impor­
>  tantly, self-reported interoceptive awareness, which does not necessarily
>  correlate with interoceptive accuracy [29], has – to our knowledge – not
>  yet been assessed in DDD [30]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dafer6xp5bqdpgeb59bc7c))


> A central feature of DDD is the experience of physiological numbing
>  and a sense of detachment between one’s sense of self and their body
>  [16]. Talking therapies may be less likely to address this fundamental
>  aspect of the disorder. Instead, “… treatment should focus on grounding
>  and orientation to the self and the here and now” [7]; p. 468).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dahpacgjd98f2bfzpefv6x))

> The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS [46]) is a 29-item
>  self-administered questionnaire designed to measure trait DD experi­
>  ences. Respondents rate the frequency (0 [“never”] – 4 [“all the time”])
>  and duration (0 [“few seconds”] – 6 [“more than a week”]) of these
>  different experiences in the preceding six months. As this research is
>  concerned with week-to-week changes in symptoms, and the CDS is the

>  symptoms, the instructions for this questionnaire were adjusted to ask
>  respondents about their symptoms in the preceding week. It should be
>  noted that the psychometric properties of using the questionnaire in this
>  way are unknown. Frequency and duration scores are summed across all
>  items, with a total scoring range of 0–290. The cut-off score for a clinical
>  diagnosis of DDD in 80% of cases is 70 [46]. This measure displayed high
>  internal consistency overall (α = 0.97). Based on a previous factor
>  analysis (Sierra et al., 2005), we also calculated scores for the Anoma­

> The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ [48]) is a 39-item
>  scale with five facets measuring trait mindfulness in everyday life.
>  Each of the 39 items is rated on a Likert scale of 1 (“never or very rarely
>  true”) to 5 (“very often or always true”). Total scores and individual
>  facet scores were calculated. As with the CDS, the instructions for this
>  questionnaire were adjusted to ask respondents about these statements
>  across the preceding week. Higher scores indicate increased mindful­
>  ness. This scale displayed high internal consistency overall (α = 0.92)
>  and for each facet: Observing (8 items; α = 0.81), Describing (8 items; α

>  (“extremely”), and the average amount of time spent, per day, scanning
>  for bodily sensations from 0 (“no time”) to 100 (“all of the time”). The

>  2-Week 3 (p = 1.00, d = 0.17). In the DDD group, no significant effects of

+++++ 
- Note: p.6 Might this suggest that for people with DDD that it takes longer for possible effects of dance/somatics practices to kick in? That there is more resistance (in whatever sense of the word) to the training? Or that these trainings simply do not work with DDD people?

> Both tasks reduce symptoms in individuals with DDD yet impacted

>  the DE task appears to enhance mindfulness and awareness of bodily

>  shift attention away from these sensations in order to accurately
>  reproduce and remember the sequence of instructed dance movements.
>  Our study is not the first to report that shifting attention in this way can
>  support wellbeing. A similar effect was found in a study on the benefits
>  of drawing for emotional regulation [65], where drawing-to-distract
>  (drawing something unrelated to one’s feelings after watching a sad
>  movie) proved to be the more effective intervention to counter the
>  negative emotions elicited by the movie. In our study, dance exercise
>  may fulfil a similar function, where people with DDD shift their atten­
>  tion away from the experience of DDD whilst at the same time increasing
>  bodily sensations. In contrast, body awareness may be more challenging
>  for those with DDD as it instructs participants to explicitly focus on their
>  bodily experiences, but may also promote an individual’s ability to
>  verbalize and articulate bodily experiences/sensations. In other words,
>  both tasks appear to address specific cognitive components of mindful­
>  ness in DDD. These results align with current theory on the causes of
>  dissociative experiences [16] which proposes that atypical somatosen­
>  sory attenuation may play a role in dissociation. On this view, explicit
>  instructions to focus on the body (as seen with the BA task) may be less
>  effective and/or more difficult for those experiencing dissociation
>  because they are already hyper-focused on, or “overthinking,” these
>  bodily sensations [61]. In contrast, a more implicit task (DE) may be
>  easier to complete and potentially more beneficial as it encourages
>  movement and exertion without an explicit instruction to focus on the
>  body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6tm4g1qzm04t206pn2mbd8g))
