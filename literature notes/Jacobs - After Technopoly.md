# Jacobs - After Technopoly

Alan Jacobs is a humanities scholar and in this article -- After Technopoly -- he calls on the work of English political philosopher Michael Oakeshott and Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski to describe the _technopoly_ (Postman's term):

> Technopoly is a system that arises within a society that views moral life as an application of rules but that produces people who practice moral life by habits of affection, not by rules. (Think of Silicon Valley social engineers who have created and capitalized upon Twitter outrage mobs.) Put another way, technopoly arises from the technological core of society but produces people who are driven and formed by the mythical core.[@jacobs_after_2019 p.4]

This interplay -- between rationalism ("The apparent captain of technopoly is what Oakeshott calls a 'rationalist'"[p.7]) and myth -- is a key aspect of Jacobs' thinking. He suggests "the possibility that technocratic rationalism can be not averted but transcended—that there is something better, not in opposition to it, but on the other side of it. Something that will in time emerge."[p.13]

The writing is -- like much of Jacobs' thinking -- a celebration of the beauty, power and value of myth making.

> “Technology” for Kołakowski is something broader than we usually mean by it. It describes a stance toward the world in which we view things around us as objects to be manipulated, or as instruments for manipulating our environment and ourselves.[p.3]

> By contrast, the mythical core of culture is that aspect of experience that is not subject to manipulation, because it is prior to our instrumental reasoning about our environment. Throughout human civilization, says Kołakowski, people have participated in myth—they may call it “illuminenation” or “awakening” or something else—as a way of connecting with “nonempirical unconditioned reality.”[p.3]

> It is in the interest of technopoly to produce people who swarm. Swarming is virality. Swarms live by memes. Swarms produce bestsellers. Swarms form outrage mobs. For their sociality swarms need devices, platforms, and apps, and they need people for whom dwelling within the ambit of those devices, platforms, and apps is a habituated impulse, a thing they learned to do from everyone else who does it.[@jacobs-2019-technopoly p.7]

> Proceduralism—with its accompanying criteria of fairness, balance, equal treatment—is a political strategy that arises from the technological core of our civilization. It seeks to manipulate discourse in such a way as to preserve itself. It is for that very reason alien to any mind shaped fundamentally by the mythical core, whose convictions arise from a reality that we perceive by living among certain persons and practicing certain forms of conduct. Those being shaped by a mythical core respond to pleas for procedural fairness by crying, “What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?” Even if some elaborate verbal gymnastics may be performed by way of post-hoc rationalization, this is ultimately why it’s okay to punch (anyone you deem) a Nazi.[p.6]

Jacobs' thinking here is based on Zygmunt Bauman's _Does Ethics Have a Chance in a World of Consumers?_ (2008). -- and idea of swarming. 


_questions & thoughts:_

- there's a link in Jacobs' description of the mythical core with the concept of direct experience, or experiences that are beyond (or before) words [[finger pointing at the moon]]

--- 

_consider:_

- [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
- contrast with Noë's understanding of rationality: [[rationality and what is likely]]
- and further contract with empiricism [[rationalism vs empiricism]]
