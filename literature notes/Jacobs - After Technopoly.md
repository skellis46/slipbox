# Jacobs - After Technopoly

Alan Jacobs is a humanities scholar and in this article -- After Technopoly -- he calls on the work of English political philosopher Michael Oakeshott and Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski to describe the _technopoly_ (Postman's term):

> Technopoly is a system that arises within a society that views moral life as an application of rules but that produces people who practice moral life by habits of affection, not by rules. (Think of Silicon Valley social engineers who have created and capitalized upon Twitter outrage mobs.) Put another way, technopoly arises from the technological core of society but produces people who are driven and formed by the mythical core.[@jacobs_after_2019 p.4]

This interplay -- between rationalism ("The apparent captain of technopoly is what Oakeshott calls a 'rationalist'"[p.7]) and myth -- is a key aspect of Jacobs' thinking. He suggests "the possibility that technocratic rationalism can be not averted but transcended -- that there is something better, not in opposition to it, but on the other side of it. Something that will in time emerge."[p.13]

The writing is -- like much of Jacobs' thinking -- a celebration of the beauty, power and value of myth making.

> "Technology" for Kołakowski is something broader than we usually mean by it. It describes a stance toward the world in which we view things around us as objects to be manipulated, or as instruments for manipulating our environment and ourselves.[p.3]

> By contrast, the mythical core of culture is that aspect of experience that is not subject to manipulation, because it is prior to our instrumental reasoning about our environment. Throughout human civilization, says Kołakowski, people have participated in myth --they may call it "illuminenation" or "awakening" or something else --as a way of connecting with "nonempirical unconditioned reality."[p.3]

> It is in the interest of technopoly to produce people who swarm. Swarming is virality. Swarms live by memes. Swarms produce bestsellers. Swarms form outrage mobs. For their sociality swarms need devices, platforms, and apps, and they need people for whom dwelling within the ambit of those devices, platforms, and apps is a habituated impulse, a thing they learned to do from everyone else who does it.[@jacobs-2019-technopoly p.7] ^cde1fd

Jacobs is citing [[Bauman - Does Ethics Have a Chance in a World of Consumers]] here (re swarms)



> Proceduralism --with its accompanying criteria of fairness, balance, equal treatment --is a political strategy that arises from the technological core of our civilization. It seeks to manipulate discourse in such a way as to preserve itself. It is for that very reason alien to any mind shaped fundamentally by the mythical core, whose convictions arise from a reality that we perceive by living among certain persons and practicing certain forms of conduct. Those being shaped by a mythical core respond to pleas for procedural fairness by crying, "What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?" Even if some elaborate verbal gymnastics may be performed by way of post-hoc rationalization, this is ultimately why it’s okay to punch (anyone you deem) a Nazi.[p.6]

Jacobs' thinking here is based on Zygmunt Bauman's _Does Ethics Have a Chance in a World of Consumers?_ (2008). -- and idea of swarming. 

> The apparent captain of technopoly is what Oakeshott calls a "rationalist" and what the historian of technology Evgeny Morozov calls a "solutionist," but that captain can achieve his political ends most readily by creating people who are not rationalists. The rationalists of Silicon Valley don’t care whom you’re calling out or why, as long as you’re calling out someone and doing it on Twitter. And in that sense the most self-consciously radical people in our society tend also to be the most obedient and predictable. But the captain of technopoly is equally obedient and predictable: CEOs swarm too. They are ultimately as enthralled by the logic of technopoly as the meekest "end user." [p.7] 

> Oakeshott wrote "The Tower of Babel" at roughly the same time as his most famous essay, "Rationalism in Politics" (1947), with which it shares certain themes. At that moment rationalism seemed, and indeed was, ascendant. Rejecting the value of habit and tradition --and of all authority except "reason" -- the rationalist is concerned solely with the present as a problem to be solved by technique; politics simply is social engineering.[pp.7-8]


> Oakeshott foresaw the coming of a world -- to him a sadly depleted world -- in which everyone, or almost everyone, would be a rationalist.[p.8]
> But that isn’t what happened. What happened was the elevation of a technocratic elite into a genuine technopoly, in which transnational powers in command of digital technologies sustain their nearly complete control by using the instruments of rationalism to ensure that the great majority of people acquire their moral life by habituation.[p.8] ^ec599c

> The lessons that I think we may draw from this sketch of three major perspectives in Robinson’s Mars novels are as follows: In an ever more highly developed technological future, mere accommodation will be co-opted; simple resistance will be unsustainable; naked myth-making will be despised and uprooted. But there may be an alternative. The great hope of the books is that one can pass through the technological to the mythical. There may be a path to areophany, to transcendence, that leads first to altering the landscape --terraforming --and then to another kind of transformation, areoforming.[p.11]

> No matter how detailed and specific and imaginative the plans of humans may be, the kami of a landscape will gradually turn those plans toward its own character, its own conformation. Something will emerge, and what emerges will never be what was planned, though it may incorporate some elements of the planning if those run with the grain, as it were, of the environment.[p.12] 

> The hope -- and I see this as the books’ hope -- is that actions on Mars that arise from the technological core of civilisation can, thanks to the emergent power of areoformation, be transformed into something with a truly mythical power.[p.13] 

> If technocratic rationalism is ultimately self-destructive, either through the damage it inflicts on the environment (whether Terran or Martian) or the ennui it inflicts on humans who trust in it, we see in these visions of a Martian future the possibility that technocratic rationalism can be not averted but transcended --that there is something better, not in opposition to it, but on the other side of it. Something that will in time emerge.[p.13] 

> First, if there is a place in the world for those who treasure a myth that claims to transcend technopoly, it will be, at best, a hidden place. If transnational technopoly can hunt you down and root you out, it will; and it probably can. Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce’s _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_, dissenting from his Irish Catholic culture, said that his weapons would be "silence, exile, and cunning." To those whose dissent from technopoly is rooted deeply in a mythological core, these are words to survive by.[@jacobs-2019-technopoly p.13]

> Second, open resistance to the regime, arising from no transcendent myth but merely deep outrage, may be able to delay some of technopoly’s victories but can prevent none.[p.14] 

> Third, the "antimythological myth" of technopoly, to borrow a term from W. H. Auden’s "In Praise of Limestone," exhausts both its adherents and itself, leaving behind an irresistible ennui. Technopoly eventually collapses under the weight of its own successes, which suggests that sooner or later, when pressed for self-justification, the rationalism of the technological core needs a mythical propulsion. Perhaps in the long run there is no purely technological core after all, but rather a technological "shell"; perhaps the choice is between a mythical core that knows itself as such and one that doesn’t. If so, then technopoly’s production of people who live within the mythical core may ultimately be self-defeating—if the people so formed end up choosing a better myth than the one technopoly proffers.[p.14] 

> Let us applaud those mythmakers who seek their own quiet corner to develop their stories, their communities. Let us applaud also overt resistance to the regime of technopoly, if it is nonviolent. But we also need people who have the resourcefulness to turn the anti-mythological myth of technopoly against itself before its coming collapse implicates us all. To find the better path, we need to re-educate ourselves in mythmaking and in the right reception of myth.[p.14]

_questions & thoughts:_

- there's a link in Jacobs' description of the mythical core with the concept of direct experience, or experiences that are beyond (or before) words [[finger pointing at the moon]]

--- 

_consider:_

- [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
- contrast with Noë's understanding of rationality: [[rationality and what is likely]]
- and further contract with empiricism [[rationalism vs empiricism]]
