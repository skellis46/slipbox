# Batson, Quin and Wilson - Integrating somatics and science

> The overall aim is to continue to promote awareness of models of embodiment for the ‘human-being-as-dancer’ by encouraging the next generation of dance science scholars to encompass theories of lived experience alongside objective and quantitative methodologies.[@batson-2012-integrating p.184]

- curious that their concern is not for dance practitioners to embrace science models/thinking??

> The use of the term ‘embodiment’ will be drawn from its scientific framework within cognitive neuroscience to represent a movement within science away from Cartesian dualism between body and mind, towards a more integrative (albeit cognitive) understanding of human existence (Varela et al. 1991; Gibbs 2006). While critics find the construct of ‘embodied cognition’ insufficient in capturing the scope of human movement (Sheets-Johnstone 2011), it represents a radical shift within science in which dance science and somatics could more readily be situated.[@batson-2012-integrating p.185]

- note their concern re cognitive ("albeit cognitive") and [[brain versus body is the new dualism]]

- they go into more detail on p.186 "An Emergent Paradigm"
- see [[six views of embodied cognition]] for co-author Wilson's perspective on embodied cognition
- contrast with [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]] for concern that embodiment is more than just embodied cognition
- see also Richardson et al re embodied-embedded approach to behaviour: [sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080466163000098?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080466163000098?via%3Dihub) - this paper cited by Batson et al

> While both dance science and somatics share similar aims of exploring and promoting efficiency and optimal functioning of the body–mind in dance (Krasnow et al. 2011; Wilson and Kwon 2008; Brodie and Lobel 2004), the means and outcomes are seemingly different.[@batson-2012-integrating p.185]

> For example, somatic experiences are not often explicitly grounded in scientific constructs, and dance science experiments often exclude somatic principles and experiences.[@batson-2012-integrating p.185]

 > this notion of embodiment helps validate first-person narrative and frames it within scientific parlance, and provides context for thinking about the integration of dance science and somatics in theory and in practice.[@batson-2012-integrating p.186]
- this sums it up really: validation

> Embodied cognition establishes the role of the body and movement in thinking, learning and meaning-making.[@batson-2012-integrating pp.186-187] 
- word 'establishes' is fascinating. But, also, what does this mean in practice? That is, so what?

- seems as if much of the writing is based on the premise that we are seeking to understand experience. It's hard to argue against this except what kinds of understanding? What kinds of experience? 
- this article is broad overview of ways in which dance science and somatics might serve each other in a 'holistic' way: "an integration of lived experience with objective methodologies, each telling its own ‘narrative’ to provide a more coherent whole."[@batson-2012-integrating pp.189-190]
