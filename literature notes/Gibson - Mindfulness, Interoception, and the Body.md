# Gibson - Mindfulness, Interoception, and the Body: A Contemporary Perspective

_previous note:_

> Mindfulness and all other forms of meditation have been shown to modulate the insula, which is the primary hub for interoception.[@gibson-2019-mindfulness p.1]

> the insula and surrounding neural circuits are believed to be responsible for a number of other functions beyond interoception including attention, awareness, and all subjective experiences, much of which has been linked to the mindfulness literature.[@gibson-2019-mindfulness p.1]

This article is an extensive review of mindfulness and interoception. Proposes two aims: 1) more accurate to link benefits attributed to mindfulness to interoception (and neurological correlates); 2) attentional style to clarify some of confusion re mindfulness, meditation and interoception. (that is, different forms of meditation require different attentional styles.)

> It may prove more useful to anchor scientific findings in the concrete body as a means to investigate those rather than a set of abstract, broadly defined meditative techniques.[@gibson-2019-mindfulness p.1]
