# Jenny Odell - Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock


_previous note:_ [[pro-filmic events occur in real time at the moment of filming]]

> Under the grid of the timetable, we each know many other varieties of time: the stretchy quality of waiting and desire, the way the present may suddenly feel marbled with childhood memory, the slow but sure procession of a pregnancy, or the time it takes to heal from injuries, physical or emotional. As planet-bound animals, we live inside shortening and lengthening days; inside the weather, where certain flowers and scents come back, at least for now, to visit a year-older self. Sometimes time is not money but these things instead. (Location 136)


> Indeed, it’s this very awareness of overlapping temporalities that invites a deep suspicion that we are living on the wrong clock. Nothing in the horizontal realm can answer that more spiritual form of burnout: the simultaneous experience of time pressure and a growing awareness of just how out of joint the climate is. Even for a very privileged person who is isolated from the effects of climate change, toggling between a Slack window and headlines about a soon-to-be-uninhabitable earth produces, at the very least, a sense of dissonance and, at the very worst, a kind of spiritual nausea and nihilism. There is a lonely absurdity in the idea of racing against the clock at the end of time, as evidenced in a headline by the parody site Reductress: “Woman Waiting for Evidence That World Will Still Exist in 2050 Before She Starts Working Toward Goals.” (Location 140)


> As I will expand on in chapter 1, the origins of the clock, calendar, and spreadsheet are inseparable from the history of extraction, whether of resources from the earth or of labor time from people. (Location 153)


> Hannah Arendt describes it: “The smallest act in the most limited circumstances bears the seed of the same boundlessness, because one deed, and sometimes one word, suffices to change every constellation.” In that sense, the issue of time is also inextricable from the issue of free will. (Location 186)


> To (re)learn to see action and decision outside such a narrow realm—to admit that everything and everyone previously left out of the picture is equally real, in kairos together—is to see time not as happening to objects in the world, but as being co-created with the actors of the world. To me, this is an issue both of justice and of practicality, as I read the climate crisis as the expression of beings (human and nonhuman) that need not be so much “saved” as heard. (Location 197)


> This phenomenon, in which one adapts her temporal rhythms to those of something or someone else, is called entrainment, and it often plays out on an uneven field of relationships that reflects hierarchies of gender, race, class, and ability. How much someone’s time is valued is not measured simply by a wage, but by who does what kind of work and whose temporality has to line up with whose, whether that means rushing or waiting or both. Keeping this field in sight is all the more important amid exhortations to “slow down” for which one person’s slowing down requires someone else to speed up. (Location 253)


> In 1989, Bill McKibben wrote, “I believe that we are at the end of nature.” Then he clarified: “By this I do not mean the end of the world. The rain will still fall, and the sun will still shine. When I say ‘nature,’ I mean a certain set of human ideas about the world and our place in it.” (Location 274)


> It sounded like Morris had lost some of the “acquisitive mood” that Susan Sontag once associated with tourist photography. Instead, he was looking for encounter. (Location 303)


> Some of the most helpful articulations of this relationship I’ve come across are from Jessica Nordell’s book, The End of Bias: A Beginning. Nordell writes that individual and institutional biases are inseparable because it’s people who make the “processes, structures, and organizational culture” in which our decisions play out. At the same time, we are each in turn influenced by the culture in which we live. Nordell thus describes the effort to address bias without refashioning structures like policies, laws, and algorithms as “running up a down escalator.” (Location 346)


> My deepest hope is that it can combine with the work of activists and those who do write expressly about policy—like Annie Lowrey, who has written on topics like universal basic income and the “time tax” imposed on the poor; or Robert E. Goodin, Lina Eriksson, James Mahmud Rice, and Antti Parpo, whose detailed analyses of policies in different countries inform their concluding recommendations in Discretionary Time: A New Measure of Freedom.[*3] (Location 354)


> It was a reminder of what Rebecca Solnit repeats several times in A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities that Arise in Disaster: “Beliefs matter.” (Location 391)

> For the worker, time is a certain amount of money—the wage. But the buyer, or employer, hires a worker to create surplus value; this excess is what defines productivity under capitalism. From an employer’s point of view, purchased time could always yield more money. (Location 769)


> Stopwatch and motion study by Frank Gilbreth. Gilbreth and his wife Lillian conducted studies of workers’ movements for industrial managers in the 1910s. (Location 855)


> It seems that the more temporal surveillance a job entails, the less likely it is to be done by someone white or male. (Location 894)


> The more fragmented and minutely timeable work becomes, the more meaningless it becomes. (Location 897)


> To some degree, content moderation could be considered a “cyborg job.” Yet the fact that it requires its workers to be both robot-like and indelibly human raises questions about many other seemingly un-Taylorizable forms of work. If you have reason to—and many do—you can measure anything in a way that seeks to maximize a certain numerical outcome: words of content per day; test score increases and “learning outcomes” per semester; and clients, customers, or patients per hour. Social work, which requires incredibly high attention to context, nuance, and personality, is just as fragmented by bureaucracy as any other form of service work. Mueller quotes one social worker: “If I wanted to work in a factory, I would have worked in a factory.” In those jobs that humans must still (or always) do, attempts to codify and intensify work continue to demoralize people just as they did those assigned the earliest Taylorized tasks. (Location 987)


> The tragedy of fungible labor time lies first in its historical association with coercion, exploitation, and the imagining of people as machines. Time is the punitive dimension in which the wage worker is both measured and squeezed. But beyond that, an overemphasis on fungible time upholds an impoverished view of what time and labor are in the first place. The industrial view of time as money can see time only as work, the masculinized work of a machine with an On/Off button. Like a grid spreading outward from the Taylorized workplace, whether on the warehouse floor or on a gig platform’s mobile interface, this framework contributes to a view of individuals who hold time like private property—I have my time, and you have yours, and we sell it on the marketplace. Now it’s not just the employer who sees you as twenty-four hours of personified labor time; it’s you, too, when you look in the mirror. (Location 1030)


> On this topic, the sociologist Richard Seymour has called social media a “chronophage,” something that “eats time.” (Location 1059)


> Time management illuminates the assumptions of the will-versus-circumstance debate because it takes the individual as the absolute unit and the near future as the time frame, at the expense of the collective good. (Location 1356)


> Byung-Chul Han suggests something even more general: that “the drive to maximize production inhabits the social unconscious,” producing what he calls “the achievement-subject.” Rather than be disciplined by something or someone external to them, achievement-subjects are “entrepreneurs of themselves,” DIY bosses propelled from within. Although it answers to no one (else), an achievement-subject nonetheless “wears down in a rat race it runs against itself”: “The disappearance of domination does not entail freedom. Instead, it makes freedom and constraint coincide. Thus, the achievement-subject gives itself over to compulsive freedom—that is, to the free constraint of maximizing achievement. Excess work and performance escalate into auto-exploitation.” (Location 1463)


> Macfadden gave this advice: This is a financial age. A struggle for wealth represents the main object of the average life. But a recognition of the importance of super-efficiency will soon awaken people everywhere to the importance of a splendid machine, in the struggle for life’s great prizes, financially and otherwise. And a machine of this character must be complete in every sense. A body that teems with power, that is surcharged with energy, is capable of doing far more work and better work than one that is frail and undeveloped. (Location 1560)


> In a conversation transcribed in The Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study, Fred Moten models a useful way of thinking about such recognition. “The ones who happily claim and embrace their own sense of themselves as privileged ain’t my primary concern,” he says. “I don’t worry about them first. But I would love it if they got to the point where they had the capacity to worry about themselves. Because then maybe we could talk.” Then he paraphrases the thinking of Fred Hampton, one of the leaders of the Black Panthers: Look: the problematic of coalition is that coalition isn’t something that emerges so that you can come help me, a maneuver that always gets traced back to your own interests. The coalition emerges out of your recognition that it’s fucked up for you, in the same way that we’ve already recognized that it’s fucked up for us. I don’t need your help. I just need you to recognize that this shit is killing you, too, however much more softly, you stupid motherfucker, you know? (Location 1597)


> But if you are truly an achievement-subject who is only wearing yourself down, then I suggest an adjustment of discretion: experimenting with what looks like mediocrity in some parts of your life. Then you might have a moment to wonder why and to whom it seems mediocre. (Location 1611)


> I have tried to make the case here for both the difference and the link between those who can afford to “lie flat” and those who cannot; those who can say no to work and those who cannot; those who can take time and those who cannot. In other words: the self-timers and the timed (although, as I’ve mentioned, the boundary is not always clear). A recognition of that relationship—“this shit is killing you, too, however much more softly”—is important for several reasons. Most fundamentally, it opens up the possibility of solidarity, in the genuine sense of sharing a common cause (“this shit”). But it is also a safeguard against the reaction that privileged people sometimes have to their own burnout: fortifying walled gardens of slowness, minimalism, and authenticity. At best, such a reaction makes it easier for people to forsake the world and leave the status quo untouched. At worst, it actually deepens the status quo, creating a scenario in which slowness becomes a product that you buy off the backs of others. (Location 1652)


> In “Slowing Down Modernity,” the researcher Filip Vostal turns a critical eye toward the rhetoric of slowness, both in popular and academic culture. He argues that slowness is “not necessarily the equivalent of poise, deliberation, long termism, duration, maturing and consequently human betterment.” The immediate irony is that when sold as a product, slowness is just another part of the logic of increase we tried to escape in the previous chapter. (Location 1741)


> The watch is an object lesson in how products and services become “paradoxically integral parts of…fast capitalism.” In this world, slowness is not so much enacted as consumed: “Slow living is now ‘for sale’ and approaches a consumerist lifestyle mostly for middle-class metropolitan dwellers—the majority of whom are probably far from holding transformative, progressivist or even socialist agendas. Arguably, many would admit that ‘it all needs to slow down,’ but such slowness would then be, more often than not, consumed, and consumed privately.” (Location 1751)


> In the context of the experience economy, Instagram, billed as “social,” is better understood as a shopping app, a marketplace for both hawking and browsing those acquisitions, whether in actual ads or the pictured lives of friends.[*3] (Location 1775)


> It’s just that, as the experience economy expands to include commodified notions of things like slowness, community, authenticity, and “nature”—all while income inequality yawns wider and the signs of climate change intensify—I feel the panic of watching possible exits blocked. I keep wanting to do something instead of consume the experience of it. But seeking new ways of being, I find only new ways of spending. (Location 1839)


> have no problem with the idea of an online social network; I just don’t want to buy a sense of community with my attention to ads, on a platform that implicitly encourages me to advertise myself, all while my data gets collected. It feels nefarious to me, like Nestlé selling us the public water supply in private bottles.[*5] (Location 1849)


> But that is just the issue with social media: It’s never clear where an individual ends and the individual-as-entrepreneur begins. This is especially true in an era that prizes “flexibility” and at a moment when “What makes you unique?” is a standard interview question. As a result, what once looked like leisure so easily becomes the arena both of the eternal self-upgrade and the search for some uniqueness to exploit. (Location 1890)


> IT’S HERE THAT I want to return to Josef Pieper’s Leisure, the Basis of Culture, which I mention in the introduction. In marked contrast to an experience to be consumed or a goal to be met, Pieper’s leisure is something closer to a state of mind or an emotional posture—one that, like falling asleep, can be achieved only by letting go. It involves a mixture of awe and gratitude that “springs precisely from our inability to understand, from our recognition of the mysterious nature of the universe.” It opens onto, and finds peace in, chaos and things larger than the self, the way you might feel when looking at an enormous cliff face—or a sunrise, for that matter. As “a form of silence…which is the prerequisite of the apprehension of reality,” true leisure requires the kind of emptiness in which you remember the fact of your own aliveness. (Location 1911)

> If my trip failed to provide peace of mind, it did provide affirmation and a sense of responsibility. Heartbreak did not make me love the birds less; it did not make the ocean less beautiful; it only suffused my seeing them with a deep desire for things to be different. In that sense, my visit could not be characterized as that of a consumer buying a product, nor even of an untroubled patron to a public park, but of a troubled being meeting a troubled world. And, crucially, this encounter occurred in time. It was the opposite of a postcard, something that could not be pictured—because a picture would be immediately out of date, and because there was so much that wouldn’t show up on the camera lens. It was complex and bittersweet, occurring in the interstices among ecological time, my personal memories, histories of injustice, and concern for the future—all washed over by a momentary pattern of light. (Location 2112)


> The best description I have seen of this problem comes from a book by Tyson Yunkaporta, who straddles both worlds as an academic, arts critic, and member of the Apalech Clan in Queensland, Australia. In Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking Can Save the World, he puts it this way: Explaining Aboriginal notions of time is an exercise in futility as you can only describe it as “nonlinear” in English, which immediately slams a big line right across your synapses. You don’t register the “non”—only the “linear”: that is the way you process that word, the shape it takes in your mind. Worst of all, it’s only describing the concept by saying what it is not, rather than what it is. We don’t have a word for nonlinear in our languages because nobody would consider traveling, thinking, or talking in a straight line in the first place. The winding path is just how a path is, and therefore it needs no name. (Location 2458)


> Conceptions of time are deeply related to how and where we see agency, including within ourselves. They matter especially now, when the world calls out not just for action, but also a less human-centric model of who and what is owed respect and justice. (Location 2467)


> Look again at the pebbles. Make no mistake: They are neither signs nor symbols of time. No—they really are two things at once: seafloor from the last ice age, and future sand. (Location 2491)


> Standing Rock Sioux activist, historian, and theologian Vine Deloria, Jr., has observed that, despite the developments in quantum physics and philosophy, “most of Western society remained Newtonian in outlook while thinkers and philosophers abandoned the belief that nature existed ‘out there.’ ”[*2] It’s worth noting here that such stickiness can’t be attributed solely to cultural inertia: Abstract, Newtonian time is the kind of time that can be measured, bought, and sold. Wage work requires us to see time as “stuff” divorced from bodies and environmental context. (Location 2520)


> In “Indigenizing the Future: Why We Must Think Spatially in the Twenty-first Century,” Daniel R. Wildcat, a Yuchi member of the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma, wonders “what would happen if human beings once again took the places—the spatial dimension—where we lived as being constitutive of our histories as time or the temporal dimension.” (Location 2558)


> IN A 1973 essay called “Approaches to What?” the French writer Georges Perec coined the term infraordinary. Media and the public perception of time, he wrote, focused on the extraordinary—things outside the ordinary, like cataclysmic events and upheavals. The infraordinary was, instead, that layer inside or just beneath the ordinary, and being able to see it involved the challenge of seeing through the habitual. This was no small task, given that invisibility is part of the very nature of habit. “This is no longer even conditioning, it’s anaesthesia,” Perec writes. “We sleep through our lives in a dreamless sleep. But where is our life? Where is our body? Where is our space?” (Location 2572)

> In An Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris, he chose the Place Saint Sulpice, a large public plaza near the center of the city, as a place of study. (Location 2580)


> In the introduction to this piece, Perec briefly lists the normal points of interest in Place Saint Sulpice, like the district council building, a police station, and “a church on which Le Vau, Gittard, Oppenord, Servandoni and Chalgrin have all worked.” By virtue of their identifiability, Perec was not interested in these. His intention, he wrote, “was to describe the rest instead: that which is generally not taken note of, that which is not noticed, that which has no importance: what happens when nothing happens other than the weather, people, cars, and clouds.” (Location 2597)


> Kimmerer considers the cliff explosions a kind of crime, even if the owner legally “owns” the rocks. “Owning diminishes the innate sovereignty of the thing,” she writes. If the owner had really loved the mosses, “he would have left them alone and walked each day to see them.” To see something in time is to allow that it has a life and to allow that this life entails more than the mechanistic cause-and-effect of a Newtonian world. In this way of thinking, mosses “decide” which rocks to live on, and even rocks have lives.[*7] (Location 2747)


> In “The Stones Shall Cry Out: Consciousness, Rocks, and Indians,” the Osage scholar George “Tink” Tinker makes the case that rocks can talk. Pointing out that there is currently no agreement as to what consciousness is, Tinker finds it both paradoxical and arrogant that “the emergent world culture…of globalized capital and Western science is equally sure that rocks certainly do not have consciousness.” (Location 2783)


> One word that comes up frequently in Tinker’s treatise on rocks is respect. For example, discussing the reductionist view of the mind as “the physical processes of the brain,” he complains of the presumption “that a highly developed neocortical brain is somehow the ultimate achievement in terms of consciousness.”[*8] In contrast, Tinker observes that “the lack of a neocortical brain or even a limbic brain in reptiles, for instance, would not sway Indian people from a deep respect and appreciation for the intelligence and consciousness of lizards.” (Location 2804)


> In the video, the connection between experience and experiment becomes clear: To experience is to test, try, and respond to one’s surroundings—a kind of call-and-response between different agents. But what also becomes clear is the political nature of who is afforded the capacity to experience the world. (Location 2858)


> Experience isn’t merely the best teacher; it’s the only teacher. If she’s learned anything raising Jax, it’s that there are no shortcuts; if you want to create the common sense that comes from twenty years of being in the world, you need to devote twenty years to the task. You can’t assemble an equivalent collection of heuristics in less time; experience is algorithmically incompressible. (Location 2874)

> And even though it’s possible to take a snapshot of all that experience and duplicate it ad infinitum, even though it’s possible to sell copies cheaply or give them away for free, each of the resulting digients would still have lived a lifetime. Each one would have once seen the world with new eyes, have had hopes fulfilled and hopes dashed, have learned how it felt to tell a lie and how it felt to be told one. Which means each one would deserve some respect. (Location 2878)


> SEEING MORE OF the world as constitutive of time, full of agency, and deserving of respect means abandoning that hierarchy that Tinker mentions, between the actor and the acted upon. Is this exhilarating or fearsome? Wildcat writes that “indigenous thinkers not only acknowledge contingency and human’s lack of control in the world; they also see it as empowering and humbling, not something frightening.” If “empowering and humbling” sounds like a paradox, it’s because of how we normally conceive of power. In a worldview where power, agency, and experience are not bound by individual bodies but reside “in and through the relations and processes that constitute life,” the paradox dissolves.

> The sky proceeded to get even darker, like a clock running backward, and it struck my animal body as deeply wrong. (Location 3002)


> Yet I’ve also begun to see such nightmares as my internalization of declinism, the belief that a once-stable society is headed for inevitable and irreversible doom. As distinct from a clearheaded (and heartbroken) assessment of our situation, declinism is probably one of the more dangerous forms of linear, deterministic time reckoning there is. (Location 3030)


> What this story does provide, however, is an extreme contrast between different ways of looking at land. In the first, land is the frozen stage on which those afforded identity might move; in the second, land is identity, expressed in time. Or, as Paula Gunn Allen writes, “The land is not really the place (separate from ourselves) where we act out the drama of our isolate destinies. It is not a means of survival, a setting for our affairs….It is rather a part of our being, dynamic, significant, real. It is our self.” (Location 3192)


> The Jamaican writer and theorist Sylvia Wynter has written about how the category of human came to be defined during the Enlightenment era: “Human” (the white economic man, the colonist, or the Man in “Man vs. Nature”) was defined against “nonhuman” in a moment of colonial exploitation, the results of which were recast as biological, atemporal conditions that explained the supposed racial traits of “backward,” “timeless,” or “less progressed” peoples who were not quite human.[*4] As it happens, this conveniently obscured historical responsibility—a little bit like a bully pushing you and then suggesting that you’re innately prone to crying. And it suggested new givens: The less-than-human were naturally inferior, while the properly human were naturally capitalist and individualistic. These were no longer outcomes of people’s choices and beliefs but a priori qualities for which, in turn, no one was responsible. (Location 3250)


> It was BP that popularized the notion of an individual carbon footprint, for example, by releasing a carbon footprint calculator in 2004. This was one of several ways energy companies would imply that the responsibility for solving climate change lay with the consumer. (Location 3327)


> Without suppressing grief, there has to be a different way of thinking about time than the one in which we’re simply strapped in all the way to the end. One way, which I’ve tried to outline so far, is to recover the contingencies of the past and the present. Another is to shift your temporal center of gravity by looking to those whose worlds have already ended many times over. (Location 3379)


> In 2019, Thom Davies wrote a study of a place in Louisiana informally named Cancer Alley. (Location 3382)


> “Having spent almost a decade investigating the lives of communities in various toxic geographies—including Chernobyl, Fukushima, and now ‘Cancer Alley’…the last thing I would describe these spaces as, is lacking in spectacle,” Davies writes. “Communities who are exposed to the slow violence of toxic pollution are replete with testimonies, experiences, and bereavements that bear witness to the brutality of gradual environmental destruction.” (Location 3390)


> In other words, seeing the future can be more a matter of looking around than looking ahead. (Location 3394)


> Kathryn Yusoff, in A Billion Black Anthropocenes or None, writes against the way the Anthropocene is “configured in a future tense rather than in recognition of the extinctions already undergone by Black and indigenous peoples.” (Location 3403)


> Māori climate activist Haylee Koroi, when asked how she felt about the contemporary idea of climate depression and fatigue, replied that “without invalidating those that feel that way, the reality is that through colonisation, we’ve been experiencing the symptoms of climate crisis for generations.” (Location 3404)


> But, for the most part, what could not be admitted in the Enlightenment fantasy of elimination and control has yet to be widely (re)admitted: the subjecthood of the nonhuman. I know that not every reader is going to follow me here, but this is how far I need to go. (Location 3469)


> Māori writer Nadine Anne Hura (Ngāti Hine, Ngāpuhi) gives this diagnosis: “We are unwell because Papatūānuku is unwell. What’s coming is worse. How can we talk about solving this sickness if we don’t acknowledge its fundamental causes? Greed, waste, the accumulation of individual wealth, an arrogant belief in the superiority of ‘man’ over every other living organism, and the perception of land as a resource to be wrung out like a dirty cloth and then discarded.” (Location 3473)


> To look into the future is to look around; to look around is to look into history—at not the apocalypse coming but the apocalypse past, the apocalypse still unfolding. Observing that the Greek word apokalypsis meant “through the concealed,” Washuta writes that “apocalypse has very little to do with the end of the world and everything to do with vision that sees the hidden, that dismantles the screen.” (Location 3518)


> The present cannot and should not be borne alone. Grief, too, can teach you new forms of subjecthood. I think of a kind of double-ness, a mutuality with the power to witness and not turn away. That which pulls me through to another day has always been another body, whether that of a friend, a flock of birds in a shrub, or the east-facing side of my favorite mountain. I draw near them, draw from them some kind of something that doesn’t quite reside in me. (Location 3539)


> A review of How to Do Nothing once said that I “employ[ed] the annoying term ‘bodies’ ” when, clearly, I must have meant people or humans.

> Just because a language is imposed, it doesn’t mean it can be controlled; and just because it’s spoken, it doesn’t mean it’s been internalized. Although Native reservations in the United States were overseen by white agents well into the twentieth century, with traditional dancing typically restricted, the Lakota figured out in the 1920s that they could hold extensive dances on the Fourth of July—if they did it under the banner of patriotism. When this tactic worked, it spread throughout the northern and southern plains, with petitions for dances on New Year’s Day, Washington’s and Lincoln’s birthdays, Memorial Day, Flag Day, and Veterans Day. In his book Indian Blues, John Troutman quotes Severt Young Bear: “The agents thought those weren’t dangerous occasions, so we got to dance.” These supposedly nationalist celebrations appeared dangerous, Troutman writes, only “when [agents] realized that they could not contain the symbolism of the holiday that they wished the Lakotas to observe.” (Location 3800)


> The workings of the IAATW—and those of the more than century-old International Transport Workers’ Federation that has pivoted to support them—exemplify what Oli Mould would call an actually creative activity, as distinct from “creativity” under capitalism. In Against Creativity, Mould observes that jobs of all sorts now encourage their employees to be “creative,” which often translates to competitive flexibility, self-management, and individual assumption of risk. Meanwhile, even nominally anti-capitalist creative work, whether art, music, or slogans, is handily appropriated by the market. Mould writes that, in either case, creativity is not actually creative, because it merely “produces more of the same form of society.” If it makes progress, it is the progress of capitalist logic into ever-more-minute corners of our daily lives, making what Braverman calls “the universal market” even more universal.[*8] (Location 3978)


> As Carole McGranahan writes, “To refuse is to say no. But, no, it is not just that. To refuse can be generative and strategic, a deliberate move toward one thing, belief, practice, or community and away from another. Refusals illuminate limits and possibilities, especially but not only of the state and other institutions.” Refusal may start in you but cannot end with you. It must be spoken, in messages, in magazines, on forums, and off-hours, in an ongoing “rehearsal.” In summoning a world, it’s the most creative thing you could possibly do. (Location 4007)


> Gloria Steinem, who appears briefly in the Waring documentary to say that most economists “seem to value their work in inverse ratio to their ability to be understood,” praises Waring for reminding readers of what economics actually is: “the way we impute value to that which we consider valuable.” (Location 4040)


> In The Problem with Work, Weeks uses this kind of energy to lay out a demand for a universal basic income and a shortened workweek with no loss of pay.[*10] Having spent the majority of her book probing the centrality and unquestioned goodness of work in modern life, Weeks sees something like universal basic income as operating on both a pragmatic and a moral-idealistic plane at the same time. On the one hand, UBI could provide relief to many people in the immediate term, addressing the fact that James and Dalla Costa put so simply in their book: “To ‘have time’ means to work less.” (Location 4071)


> Philosopher Ivan Illich worried in 1978 that “innumerable sets of infrastructures in which people coped, played, ate, made friends, and loved have been destroyed,” leaving a barren social landscape of “huge zero-sum games, monolithic delivery systems in which every gain for one turns into a loss or burden for another, while true satisfaction is denied to both.” (Location 4160)


> Would it be possible not to save and spend time, but to garden it—by saving, inventing, and stewarding different rhythms of life? And wouldn’t this simply be an acknowledgment and use of the chronodiversity that already exists for all of us on some level, individually or communally? (Location 4180)


> Saying it meant that you could take time and give time, but also that you could plant time and grow more of it and that there were different varieties of time. It meant that all your time grew out of someone else’s time, maybe out of something someone planted long ago. It meant that time was not the currency of a zero-sum game and that, sometimes, the best way for me to get more time would be to give it to you, and the best way for you to get some would be to give it back to me. If time were not a commodity, then time, our time, would not be as scarce as it seemed just a moment ago. Together, we could have all the time in the world. (Location 4194)

> “The economic tempo of the clock shapes our every conversation,” while schools and workplaces assume “a form of able-bodied productivity, an ideal of speed and efficiency.” (Location 4361)


> This gift, for Hendren, is analogous in some ways to the gift of disability studies in general, which is a questioning of what the good life means not just for disabled people, but for every person with a body that is not a machine and a soul that is more than a worker. (Location 4372)


> Hendren asks. “Is the clock of industrial time built for bodies at all?” In proposing a different kind of clock, crip time unsettles (as Sharma would say) what time means. Heterogeneous, nonstandard, and attentive to the body, it feels closer to the sundial than the clock. (Location 4377)


> Similarly, Handke describes a certain kind of tiredness as enabling “more of less of me,” the reality that expands when the ego recedes. Quoting Handke, Han writes, “The trusting tiredness ‘opens’ the I and ‘makes room’ for the world….One sees, and one is seen. One touches, and one is touched….Less I means more world: ‘Now tiredness was my friend. I was back in the world again.’ ” (Location 4435)


> If aliveness means touching and being touched—being in the world, being kept alive—then the scale between living and dead is inescapably social. (Location 4454)


> Miller’s own personal definition of being alive sounds remarkably similar to the photographer’s relationship with the lake and to what Handke’s “tiredness” allows: “For me, death is when I can no longer engage with the world around me; when I can no longer take anything in and, therefore, can no longer connect.” (Location 4458)


> discrimination that a felony conviction brings—Price borrows Patricia Williams’s term spirit murder, which Williams calls “the disregard for others whose lives qualitatively depend on our regard.” Price, whose book reflects not only research and analysis but also social familiarity with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated subjects, suggests that the cost of social death for the people he knows is borne not just by them, but by everyone else, too. “The hidden cost of spirit murder may be in missing the rich realities among us,” he writes, “replacing the curiosity one might have in the interior life of contemporaries and compatriots with phantasms that inspire hostility and loathing.” Those who traffic in social death, in other words, imagine a world of zombies. (Location 4571)


> Describing the growth of mutual and self-regard within a brutal space of disregard, Price calls this grace. Grace persists in spite of rather than because of incarceration, Price notes, as “violence is neither necessary nor desirable to achieve grace.” (Location 4594)


> To me, grace is linked to the need for self-transcendence as described by Viktor Frankl, the author of Man’s Search for Meaning. In “Self Transcendence as a Human Phenomenon,” he describes something that sounds like the opposite of an “unchanging propensity”: “It is a constitutive characteristic of being human that it always points, and is directed, to something other than itself. It is, therefore, a severe and grave misinterpretation of man to deal with him as if he were a closed system. Actually, being human profoundly means to be open to the world, a world, that is, which is replete with other beings to encounter and with meanings to fulfill.” (Location 4595)


> People and things are alive when we become alive to one another. To regard someone is a balancing of power, an agreement not just to shift one’s center of gravity, but to admit to two centers. (Location 4638)


> When he quotes Frantz Fanon—“Superiority? Inferiority? Why not simply try to touch the other, feel the other, discover the other?”—it is a reminder of how much is possible. (Location 4652)


> The poem illustrates Frankl’s notion that to be human is to be directed to something other than oneself and Patty Berne’s observation that the experience of tension within time is life itself. (Location 4731)


> No matter how optimized, healthy, and productive I am, I simply will not become more or better forever, which means there are things I will never do and never be. (Location 4741)


> As the civil rights activist Yuri Kochiyama said, life is not yours alone but also “the input of everyone who touched your life and every experience that entered it.” This is true both now and after you’ve gone. (Location 4752)


> Like Miller’s definition of aliveness as “touch[ing] the planet,” Handke’s description of touching and being touched, or Hartmut Rosa’s “resonance” in the epigraph for this chapter, my definition of being alive is simply that: the embrace. I feel alive if I’m not alone in the air, but embraced by it. (Location 4771)


> But for this to happen, for there to be “more of less of me,” the forward-leaning ego that grasps at time has to die—at least for that moment. This death can feel like a trust fall into time and mortality itself. The philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti writes that, in a state of complete attention, “the thinker, the center, the ‘me’ comes to an end.” This supposed emptiness makes way for so much more, as “it is only a mind that looks at a tree or the stars or the sparkling waters of a river with complete self-abandonment that knows what beauty is, and when we are actually seeing[,] we are in a state of love.” That state, he says, has “no yesterday and no tomorrow.” This is easier said than done, of course, and my whole life so far seems to consist of forgetting and remembering this wisdom. But whenever I do remember, I forgive myself for forgetting. I’ve come to see the truly alive, ego-dissolving state less as a goal to arrive at and closer to something like rain. It comes and goes, and when it comes, you make use of it and give thanks. (Location 4776)


> Similarly, in How We Show Up, Mia Birdsong quotes Desmond Tutu’s description of the South African idea of Ubuntu: “We say a person is a person through other persons. It is not I think therefore I am. It [is] rather: I am human because I belong, I participate, and I share.” (Location 4813)


> No one is responsible for an emergence; no one can glory in it, since it always occurs in the interstice. —Michel Foucault, “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History” (Location 4852)


> Sitting like that in the midst of a chaotic meantime, the Buddha reminded me of an anecdote from Ajahn Chah, a Thai meditation master: “You see this goblet? I love this glass. It holds the water admirably. When the sun shines in, it reflects the light beautifully. When I tap it, it has a lovely ring. Yet for me this glass is already broken. When the wind knocks it over, my elbow knocks it off the shelf, and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‘Of course.’ But when I understand that this glass is already broken, every minute with it is precious.” (Location 4874)


> Trying to draw a line around myself, I am forced to ask, Am I Jenny or am I my mother’s daughter, my grandmother’s granddaughter? and so on. If I am an event, when did I start? Thirty-five years ago? Hundreds of years ago? Thousands? Am “I” not like the visible mushroom growing out of a substrate outside which I would be incomprehensible, even impossible? (Location 4964)


> In Astra Taylor’s “Out of Time: Listening to the Climate Clock,” an essay that fundamentally influenced my entire line of questioning in this book, she notes that kairos in modern Greek now means “weather” and goes on to describe its usefulness in ecological terms: “Perhaps the opportune time to intervene is fleeting, like a passing thunderstorm or the peak of spring, and we risk a mismatch by striking too late.” It occurs to me, reading this, that the phrase isn’t “seize time.” It’s “seize the time.” (Location 5002)


> your priority is speed and a need to remain ahead of the curve, doubt can look only like a cost, like those “delays” and “interruptions” of the inevitable and taken-for-granted that Daniel Hartley identified in “Anthropocene, Capitalocene, and the Problem of Culture.” (Location 5058)


> In this context, doubt is actually the valuable thing, the thing we want to seize. But encountering freshness and agency in this way, Arendt wrote, required someone to hold their ground “between the clashing waves of past and future.” Otherwise, you’d get flattened by certainty: The past would crush you with tradition, and the future would crush you with determinism. Hence the importance and fragility of the “gap” (another term for “non-time”) in the title of Arendt’s preface, “The Gap between Past and Future.” (Location 5086)
