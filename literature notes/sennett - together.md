# Sennett - Together: The Rituals, Pleasures and Politics of Co-operation

>We have many more machines than our ancestors but less idea of how to use them well; we have greater conduits between people thanks to modern forms of communication but less understanding of how to communicate well. Practical skill is a tool rather than a salvation, but, lacking it, issues of Meaning and Value remain abstractions. p.x

>In social and personal life we all come up against the limits on desire and will, or the experience of other people's needs which cannot be reconciled with our own. This experience ought to teach modesty, and so promote an ethical life in which we recognize and honour what lies beyond us. (p.x)

>Tribalism couples solidarity with others like yourself to aggression against those who differ. This is a natural impulse, since most social (p.4) animals are tribal; they hunt together in packs, they lay out territories to defence; the tribe is necessary for their survival. In human societies, however, tribalism can prove counter-productive. Complex societies like our own depend on works flowing across borders; contain different ethnicities, races and religions; generate diverging ways of sexual and family life. To force all this complexity into a single cultural mould would be politically repressive and tell a lie about ourselves. The 'self' is a composite of sentiments, affiliations and behaviours which seldom fit neatly together; any call for tribal unity will reduce this personal complexity. (pp.3-4) ^27bf7c

>Obviously mutual aggression cannot hold a city together, but Aristotle made this precept more subtle. Tribalism, he said, involves thinking you know what other people are like without knowing them; lacking direct experience of others, you fall back on fearful fantasies. Brought up to date, this is the idea of the stereotype. (p.4)

>In this book, without invoking such cynicism, I want to focus on a small corner of what might be done about destructive cooperation of the us-against-you sort, or about cooperation degraded into collusion. The good alternative is a demanding and difficult kind of cooperation; it tries to join people who have separate or conflicting interests, who do not feel good about each other, who are unequal, or who simply do not understand one another. The challenge is to respond to others on their own terms. This is the challenge of all conflict management. (p.6)

>Cultural homogenization is apparent in modern architecture, clothing, fast food, popular music, hotels . . . an endless, globalized list.8 ‘Everybody is basically the same’ expresses a neutrality-seeking view of the world. The desire to neutralize difference, to domesticate it, arises (or so I will try to show) from an anxiety about difference, which intersects with the economics of global consumer culture. One result is to weaken the impulse to cooperate with those who remain intractably Other. (p.8) ^d4435f

>‘People who do not observe, cannot converse.’18 This wisdom-nugget from an English barrister evokes the essence of ‘dialogics’. This technical word names attention and responsiveness to other people. The barrister’s bon mot particularly calls attention to the listener’s share in a discussion. Usually, when we speak about communication skills, we focus on how to make a clear presentation, to present what we think or feel. Skills are indeed required to do so, but these are declarative in character. Listening well requires a different set of skills, those of closely attending to and interpreting what others say before responding, making sense of their gestures and silences as well as declarations. Though we may have to hold ourselves back to observe well, the resulting conversation will become a richer exchange for it, more cooperative in character, more dialogic. p.14

>Still, the musical rehearsal resembles those discussions, in which the skills of listening to others become as important as making clear statements. The philosopher Bernard Williams writes scathingly about the ‘fetish of assertion’, that impulse to ram home your case as though its content is all that counts.21 Listening skills don’t figure much in this kind of verbal joust; the interlocutor is meant to admire and so to agree, or to counter with equal assertiveness – the familiar dialogue of the deaf in most political debate. p.18

>About this skill, Theodore Zeldin writes, in a small, wise book on conversation, that the good listener detects common ground more in what another person assumes than says.23 The listener elaborates that assumption by putting it into words.  p.19
