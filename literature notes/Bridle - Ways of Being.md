# James Bridle - Ways of Being

_previous note:_

## Introduction: More than Human

- deepest need of AI is fuel for its own expansion
- comparing AI with corporations
- corporations use humans as sensors and effectors
- Charles Stross age of corporate control as akin to alien invasion; global state for benefit of non-humans (corporations)
- limited (but common) definition of intelligence in machines based on profit-seeking and extractive
- other ways of thinking and doing intelligence
- AI to bring us closer to the natural world ('which our technology has sundered')
- ecology of technology
- Greek term _ekos_ meaning house or environment
- ecology as scope or attitude of study (rather than field)

> Ecological thought, once unleashed, permeates everything. It is as much _movement_ as science, with all the motive, restless energy that word connotes. Every discipline discovers its own ecology in time, as it shifts inexorably from the walled gardens of specialized research towards a greater engagement with the wider world. As we expand our field of view, we come to realize that everything impacts everything else – and we find meaning in these interrelationships.[@bridle-2022-ways n.p.] 

- history of technology as "wilful blindness" to context and consequences of its enactment
- Ursula Le Guin: "Technology is the active human interface with the material world."
- JB's concern is with role and impact of technologies in relation to surrounding world. "all technologies are ecological"
- technology (building on Le Guin above) ties us to our context and environment
- reconcile scope and material demands of technology with present situation

> The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the eyes of others only a green thing that stands in the way. Some see nature all ridicule and deformity … and some scarce see nature at all. But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself. - William Blake

- more-than-human world - term coined by David Abram ^d5b6ba
- biosphere (animate forces) as companions and teachers

> No matter how much our own species preoccupies us, life is a far wider system. Life is an incredibly complex interdependence of matter and energy among millions of species beyond (and within) our own skin. These Earth aliens are our relatives, our ancestors, and part of us. They cycle our matter and bring us water and food. Without “the other” we do not survive. -- Lynn Margulis ^d69567

- world as made up of subjects, not objects

> ‘Life and Reality’, wrote the Buddhist philosopher Alan Watts, ‘are not things you can have for yourself unless you accord them to all others. They do not belong to particular persons any more than the sun, moon and stars.’

- nature is imagination itself

## 1. Thinking Otherwise

- umwelt (Jakob von Uexküll) = particular perspective of particular organism
- classification of animals: pets, livestock and wild beasts; JB transfers this classification onto AI
- historical categories of animal and machine are not to be trusted (master, servant, slave and resource)
- historical definition of intelligence is _what humans do_
- Turing and imagining an intelligent machine
- Turing and being surprised by machines
- Turing test deeply human-centric; judging AI by our own standards
- rethinking 'artificial' intelligence might help rethink intelligence

> The lengths we go to in our attempts to prove or disprove to ourselves that other beings are worthy of being called intelligent might be absurd if they weren’t so tragic.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag.]

- different tools for different bodies (and different minds with those bodies)
- bodies matter to minds
- [[habeus corpus]]
- culturally biased testing processes for mirror test
- intelligence as something more-than-human
- octopus brains that extend throughout their bodies into their limbs
- convergent evolution and octopus eye (better than human eye)
- intelligence is something one does

> Intelligence, then, is not something to be tested, but something to be recognized, in all the multiple forms that it takes. The task is to figure out how to become aware of it, to associate with it, to make it manifest. This process is itself one of entanglement, of opening ourselves to forms of communication and interaction with the totality of the more-than-human world, much deeper and more extensive than those which can be performed in the artificial constraints of the laboratory. It involves changing ourselves, and our own attitudes and behaviours, rather than altering the conditions of our non-human communicants.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag]

- humans adapting behaviour to suit animals (rather than animals getting used to us)
- to ignore a baboon is not a neutral act (and same with our relationship to the world)
- appreciation of outer behaviours change sensitivity to inner lives (and sense of identity) -- am reminded here of [[authentic movement]]
- states of mind in animals that are untestable and inaccessible: how to pay respect to these phenomena in [[interoception]] and crossdisciplinary work? 

> Goodall also writes about the chimpanzee’s rain dances, performed at the onset of heavy downpours. During these displays, the chimpanzees will grasp saplings and low branches and sway them rhythmically back and forth, then move forward slowly while loudly slapping the ground with their hands, stamping their feet and hurling rocks. While loath to draw firm conclusions from such displays, Goodall associates them with ‘feelings akin to wonder and awe’ and notes that afterwards the performer will sit quietly for some time watching the water, much like Smuts’s baboons around the pools.[@bridle-2022-ways n.p.]

- real intelligence made evident  by building, observing, relating and feeling
- intelligence is a stream
- AI helps us come to terms with all other intelligences on planet
- AI as way to help accommodate us to the world?

## 2. Wood Wide Webs

- desire to reach out and touch trees (it was if the body is less and less important)
- making sense of 'abilities' of organisms means to ask 'what is ecological relevance?' Framed "within an ecological context, the context of their relationships"
- acknowledging other forms because they enrich us
- we share a world
- decentring humans is vital in more-than-human world
- acknowledge other worlds and the worlds of others is key to "disentangling ourselves from our greatest social and technological deception, and re-entangling ourselves with a more meaningful and compassionate cosmology."
- understanding value of interpretation, situated knowledge and trained judgement
- friction caused by attempting to force the world to conform to our portrayal of it - in [[artistic research and ecosystems]] perhaps this is useful in the sense of how artistic research attempts to force theory to conform to the work we make?? (long draw!)
- fallacy of one world for all (instead there are multiplicity of worlds held in common)
- we share a world
- twin hazards in thinking of more-than-human world: anthropocentrism and anthropomorphism
- end human exceptionalism and human supremacism. Humans not at centre of universe

> it is precisely through the acknowledgement of difference that shared action and shared life, without the weight of domination and control, becomes possible. We seek to meet, and not to conquer. We are as comfortable with companionable silence as with talking. We have different words for the same things.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag.]

- science has tended to view organisms as series of tiny interconnected machines rather than whole organisms

> When we open ourselves to the voices of the more-than-human world, this is always the result: a breaching and collapsing of the established borders of thought and feeling. This is the outcome that shines through these encounters, with all kinds of intelligences, including ‘artificial’ ones.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag] 

- plants have proprioception
- intelligence is insufficient as a way to explain abilities of plants
- debates about intelligence (of things) are about meaning of words rather than the being of things
- plants are fungi evolved to farm algae that have evolved to farm fungi
- internet (with data centres, undersea cables, etc) is our mycorrhizal network
- AI as intelligence that is something doable in fantastic ways
- ecological lesson from technology: we are one of many flowers
- standing on a ruined planet and no longer the smartest in the room (and not smart enough to save ourselves)

## 3. The Thicket of Life

- personal digital data as radioactive waste
- Barad on becoming-phenomena and becoming-bodies, and on intraaction -- where two phenomena or bodies act on one another
- Barad on quantum field and us living in "this shifting, vibrating, scintillating field"
- For more on Karen Barad’s work, see Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2007), or her essay ‘On Touching – The Inhuman That Therefore I Am’, Differences, 23(3), 1 December 2012, pp. 206–23; DOI:10.1215/10407391-1892943
- the more-than-human world lacks clear breaks, borders or divisions [[a border is not a boundary]]
- reductive science mirrored by binary nature of technology; but more we attempt to "perform such abstractions" distinctions blur and fall apart
- when we study the world we are only making evident limits of our own thinking (embodied in our logbooks and measuring instruments) ^b5edaa
- Lewis Fry Richardson: more accurately try to measure things, the more complex they become (Richardson effect)
- Richardson effect later termed 'fractals' by Benoit Mandelbrot: structures which repeat to infinite complexity
- with closer scrutiny (enabled by technology), instead of a rigid map, a pattern of interference is revealed
- notion of individual tied to politics of sovereignty and agency
- hallmarks of Western philosophy: subject and object, self and other
- we have never been individuals: Gilbert, Sapp and Tauber: S. Gilbert, J. Sapp, A. Tauber, with J. D. Thomson and S. C. Stearns (eds), ‘A Symbiotic View of Life: We Have Never Been Individuals’, The Quarterly Review of Biology, 87(4), December 2012, pp. 325–41; DOI:10.1086/668166. - [[Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth]]
- horizontal gene transfer (including how 10% of human genome is transmission of DNA through viruses)
- symbiosis: we are product of cooperation, interaction and mutual dependence
- human microbiome (2kg of bacteria and other organisms mostly in our gut) influences our awareness and behaviour
- Endosymbionts are organisms that live within other organisms
- we are not individuals, we are walking assemblages: "riotous communities of multi-species, multi-bodied beings, inside and outside of our very cells"
- organismal lineages as emergent reality (Doolittle)
- sense of species superiority is a delusion of grandeur (Margulis)
- driver of change (at individual level and level of evolution) is the encounter with the other
- The Cloud as "emergent metaphor", as shared umwelt 
- the Cloud reveals how fixed data and unbreakable categories, conclusions over processes, ends over means is antithetical to society and humankind
- systems for interpreting and applying schemas must be open, transparent, comprehensible and renegotiable
- possible to live as symbionts rather than subjects in messy more-than-human world

## 4. Seeing Like a Planet

- when attention is governed by machines it is attuned to the nanosecond and the breadth of a beam of light; make it difficult to think of others operating at different scales of time and geography
- phenology concerned with appearance of things in temporal sense
- phenological mismatch - e.g. our dependence on antagonistic, machinic imaginings of time
- ecology seeks to find connections between all things -- [[artistic research and ecosystems]] ^2568db
- mention of The Overstory science fiction story about aliens landing on Earth who have completely different temporal way of being: they see us as frozen statues
- _circumnutation_ is to bend or move around in an irregular circle or ellipse
- nutation is "a mode of expansion which is not reactive, muscular, and domineering, but gentle, expansive and generative. It is through their own attentiveness to their environment that plants have obtained the world."[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag.]
- Duchamp's _The Large Glass_ included 'inhuman agency'

> Duchamp sought to incorporate into the work an inhuman agency: an accommodation with time and fate; an insistence on mystery, incompleteness and unknowability.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag.] ^84a1eb

- describing Duchamp and Darwin projecting onto glass to stimulate a particular kind of attention and awareness of invisible modes of life
- transparency does not equate to understanding; seeing does not mean knowing or dominating
- intention informs what we see
- images taken by Landsat in huge digital archive: <https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/>
- technology can change our vision
- Jean Epstein and early time-lapse experiments (1935): 

> Slow motion and fast motion reveal a world where the kingdoms of nature know no boundaries. Everything is alive. A surprising animism is being reborn. We know now, because we have seen them, that we are surrounded by inhuman existences.[Epstein, in @bridle-2022-ways n.pag.]

- experience of something enhance by time invested: intra-action at work: combining a change in vision with a change in being
- practice generates knowledge and understanding
- education in technology: knowledge and know-how to design and deploy them critically and thoughtfully
