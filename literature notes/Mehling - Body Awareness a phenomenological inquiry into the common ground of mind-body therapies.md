# Mehling et al - Body Awareness: a phenomenological inquiry into the common ground of mind-body therapies

_previous note:_ [[harmful content project preparation]]

> The qualitative analysis of these focus groups with representative practitioners of body awareness practices, and the perspectives of their patients, elucidated the common ground of their understanding of body awareness. For them body awareness is an inseparable aspect of
embodied self awareness realized in action and interaction with the environment and world. It is the awareness of embodiment as an innate tendency of our organism for emergent self-organization and wholeness. [@mehling-2011-body p.1]

> These approaches aim to cultivate a particular quality of
body awareness characterized by non-judgmental ‘mindfulness’, “a quality of non-elaborative awareness to current experience and a quality of relating to one’s experience with an orientation of curiosity, experiential openness, and acceptance” [17] [@mehling-2011-body p.1]

> Body awareness involves an attentional focus on and awareness of internal body sensations. Body awareness, as we define it here, is the subjective, phenomenological aspect of proprioception and interoception that enters conscious awareness, and is modifiable by mental processes including attention, interpretation, appraisal, beliefs, memories, conditioning, attitudes and affect. [@mehling-2011-body p.1]

> To better understand the conceptualization of body awareness in mind-body therapies that claim to provide benefits from enhancing body awareness, we invited leading practitioners and teaching faculty of these approaches as well as their patients and conducted focus groups. These focus group sessions were conducted as one step in the systematic development of a new multi-dimensional self-report measure of body awareness. The contributions of these focus groups to the measure development and the definition of dimensions within the construct will be discussed in a later paper. The aim of this paper is to articulate the place and function of body awareness in each of the approaches and how these lead to desired outcomes as narrated by practitioners and patients and, thereby, to gain insights into the concept of body awareness as it is understood theoretically, as it is conveyed in practice, and as it is experienced. [@mehling-2011-body p.2]

> Practitioners were asked the following questions:
> 1) “In a nutshell (1 minute), can you tell us about your work and describe a typical client for your method, the reason he/she came to see you, what he/she hopes to get from your method, and what you hope the client gets from it?”
> 2) “Understanding that different practices use differ- ent types of language to describe what they do, what does body awareness mean to you and how is it a part of your work?”
> 3) “If you consider your specific approach, how, or in which way, do you think it improves a client’s body awareness?”
> 4) “If you talk about body awareness with your cli- ents, how do you talk about it? What words or terms do you use? If you don’t verbalize about body awareness, how do you address it in your practice?”
> 5) “Do you think a client’s body awareness has an impact on her/his health condition? Can you please illustrate this for us with an example from your practice?” [@mehling-2011-body pp.2-3]

- This method ought to be done for somatic practices. The questions below this in the paper are also very useful for harmful content. What questions might we ask the participants? 

> The qualitative team (WEM, JW, VG) used a team-based approach [48] to
identify and code themes [49] separately for practitioners and patients following the strategy of Lincoln and Guba [50,51]. [@mehling-2011-body p.3]

- Useful for analysis of the language? 

> They expressed a preference for the term “self awareness” rather than body awareness. Or conversely, when they used the term body awareness, they emphasized that it is meant to include “every level... the physical, the breath, the mind, the personality and the emotions”, that the ‘body’ of body awareness is inseparable from its functions and all other aspects of self awareness. They could talk about body awareness if it was understood as a core aspect of embodied self-awareness.[@mehling-2011-body p.4]

> A central skill that patients learn through training and repetition is the ability to notice sensations, thoughts and feelings as they occur in their actual immediacy. What is noticed might be verbalized or not. The point is that the process of noticing and the learning of differentiated noticing were viewed by the practitioners as a path to integration. [@mehling-2011-body p.6]

> So through repetition and training in these skills of noticing, differentiating, and discerning, individuals engaged in mind-body practices that involve the body are immersed in a process that leads to embodiment and integration.[@mehling-2011-body p.7]

> For them body awareness is an inseparable aspect of embodied self awareness realized in action and interaction with the environment and world. It is the awareness of embodiment as an innate tendency of our organism for emergent self-organization and wholeness. [@mehling-2011-body p.10]

> The process that patients undergo in these therapies was seen as a progression towards greater unity between body and self, very similar to the conceptualization of embodiment as a dialectic of body and self described by some philosophers as being experienced in four levels [56]: 1) in a level labeled “the lived body” the body is taken for granted, and patients are unself-consciously aware or unaware of it, the body often described as “absent” [57]. This state was well-described by the patients when they began their practices. 2) in a level labeled “the objective body state” the body is experienced as opposed to the self. Body and self are in tension with each other or in disunity, the body becomes “symptomatic” and the patient describes physical constraints including pain and some degree of loss of function. That state seemed to be the situation that brought the patients into the therapy. 3) A third stage labeled as “cultivated immediacy” was described by practitioners and patients as well: it is experienced as a new relationship to the body characterized by acceptance, immediacy and the body experienced with-out objectification. 4) In the fourth state labeled “the subjective body” the body is experienced as a source of learning and meaning, by practitioners described as endowed with “intelligence” and an “innate tendency towards embodiment”. In this state the body a) is no longer just the means by which the self carries out its projects or b) the source of constraints and limits to the self’s goals, but rather an integral and equal part of the self and the locus of consciousness and subjectivity with its own perspective [55].

> The theoretical stance of the practitioners demonstrates a striking parallel to positions presented by phenomenological philosophers who, in the tradition of French phenomenologist Merleau-Ponty [52], attempt to transcend viewing persons in dualistic terms and focus not on “the body” as such but on what it means to be ‘embodied’ [53,54]. “Embodiment is the human experience of simultaneously having and being a body; the term conceptualizes the body as a dynamic, organic site of meaningful experience rather than as a physical object distinct from the self or mind” [55]. [@mehling-2011-body p.10]

> In addition, these findings suggest that we need to broaden the biomedical paradigm to consider and include a developmental model of embodiment in order to better understand how body awareness-enhancing therapies work [52,63]. This paradigmatic model has been proposed for several decades in philosophical and nursing literature [52,63]. It overcomes the mind-body split, as it still persists in the biomedical model and integrates the phenomenology of complex mind-body interactions, as they are experienced by practitioners and patients in body awareness-enhancing therapies.[@mehling-2011-body p.11]
