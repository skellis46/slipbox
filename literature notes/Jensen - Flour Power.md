# Flour Power by Tara Jensen

Then she said, “Think of grain as fresh produce.”


Two years later I loaded up my 1982 Volvo and went to work at Farm and Sparrow, a bakery tucked away in the mountains of western North Carolina.


it’s often lost that the toast you’re enjoying began life as a collection of grass seeds waving in the wind.


I like to focus on purchasing flour from mills that source from farms using regenerative growing practices, organic pest and weed control, and crop rotation.


Fermentation: in the case of sourdough, we’re talking about yeast and lactobacilli consuming simple sugars and producing alcohol, acids, and gas


Gluten: two proteins, gliadin and glutenin, that form a long chain—the chain is called gluten


Couched in this substance are gliadin and glutenin, the two proteins necessary for making gluten. Gliadin gives dough extensibility and glutenin provides elasticity.


Transitioning between the bran and the endosperm is the aleurone layer, a sheath where enzymes and lactic acid bacteria live.


Besides having different levels of protein, the bran of hard wheat and soft wheat each responds differently to being milled, particularly in a stone mill. Hard wheat shatters, making tiny, sharp freckles in the flour that are difficult to remove, whereas the bran of a soft wheat comes off in large portions, making it easy to sift out.


Think of freshly milled flour as you would fresh produce: It can spoil—so I store stone ground and fresh flour in my freezer and let it come to room temperature before mixing my dough. When in doubt, touch, taste, and smell your flour for any off scents or pungent flavors. Yes, flour is a living ingredient and does not last forever!


The yeast and lactic acid bacteria digest the simple sugars in the flour and produce alcohol, acids, and gas. Around and around they go, eating and reproducing until there’s no food left and they need to be fed.


There are more than a thousand varieties of yeast in the world, and yet only a few, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (which means “sugar mold”), have the ability to live in a highly acidic environment and to digest the specific sugars in flour.


I use heavy-duty Hobart welding gloves instead (which I also use when working with my wood-fired oven and grill).


The weight of the flour is determined by dividing the total weight of the dough (1,000g) by the total percentage (182%) and then multiplying the result by 100 to switch from a decimal to a percentage (1,000 / 182 = 5.4945 × 100 = 549g). Once you have the flour weight, you can calculate the remaining ingredient weights by multiplying the percentage, in decimal form, by the flour weight (0.70 × 549 = 384g). Add all the weights together to check that the result matches the total amount of dough needed, and you’re good to go!


Humidity will speed things up and make a sticky dough.


To prepare your starter for a nap in the fridge, you’ll want to stiffen it by reducing the amount of water. This slows down fermentation, which reduces activity and acid production (yeast and bacteria go dormant below 40°F).


I like to feed mine around 9:00 p.m., leave it somewhere cool, around 65°F, and mix the next morning around 6:00 a.m.


Spelt is an ancient grain and the preferred grain of my favorite nun, Hildegard von Bingen. In her 1855 work, Physica, she outlines food as powerful medicine and cites spelt as the best grain for “strengthening the flesh and purifying the blood.” This loaf is dedicated to women around the world who pull roots, talk to flowers, and defy tradition.


Like wheat, rye has an aleurone layer (see below). In rye, this layer permeates the endosperm, going deeper into the core of the berry. The endosperm also lacks a balance of gliadin and glutenin, with only a high level of gliadin. These factors mean that flour made from the rye berry will be quite active (extra enzymes), quick to ferment (more sugar), and quite fragile (very little to no gluten).


Amylase is inactive in a low-pH environment, so if you acidify rye doughs by using sourdough and build the dough slowly in steps, you will increase the pH over time and make baking rye bread smooth sailing.


To prepare your rye starter for a fridge rest, add 50g of your starter to a clean container (such as a 1-quart deli container) and mix in 100g whole-grain rye flour and 75g of warm water. Stir gently until there are no patches of dry flour. Cover tightly with a lid and leave out at room temp (68° to 72°F) for 3 hours, then transfer to the fridge.
