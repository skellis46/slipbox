# Bermúdez - The Bodily Self, Selected Essays on Self-Consciousness

> According to the ecological approach, the perception of objects is not neutral. Instead, the optical array carries information about the possibilities that surfaces and objects afford the organism. A surface might be seen as affording support, for example, or an object as being manipulable or edible. Affordances carry information about the behavioral possibilities open to an organism.
> In these respects, then, Gibson’s concept of ecological perception reveals a basic awareness of the bodily self that can serve as the core of a comprehensive account of full-fledged self-consciousness in thought and action. On the ecological understanding of perception, sensitivity to self-specifying information is built into the very structure of perception in such a way that, as Gibson famously put it, all perception involves coperception of the (bodily) self and the environment. 

- see [[The lure of the Dancing Queen]] for mention of Gibson, and also Janet Murray.

 > It is hard, and not particularly profitable, to try to disentangle the philosophical study of bodily awareness from the scientific study in psychology and physiology of how the mechanisms of bodily awareness function, or from neuropsychological inquiries into what happens in disorders of bodily awareness. In part, this is because bodily awareness is a somewhat concealed phenomenon. We depend on it constantly, but rarely attend to it. In part, it is because (unlike vision, touch, hearing, taste, and smell) it does not derive from a single dedicated sensory modality. And, in part, it is because bodily awareness plays an important role structuring and framing our general perceptual experience of the world (and of ourselves) so that it is not always easy to identify which elements in our multimodal experience of the world are contributed by bodily awareness.
