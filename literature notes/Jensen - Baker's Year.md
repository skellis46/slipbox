# A Baker’s Year Twelve Months of Baking and Living the Simple Life at the Smoke Signals Bakery by Tara Jensen

I beg you to build a circle of wonder around your baking and protect it. It is a small act that contains the greatest effort : to remain awake, to remain adaptable, and to remain in love. Don’t toss it aside. Don’t trade it in. Stay and practice. Your Kitchen is a laboratory of the sacred order. Time and temperature will find you in the correct place. As we make bread, we make ourselves.


As a basic grass, wheat is designed to nourish itself, protect itself, and reproduce. The germ, endosperm, and bran each play a role in this unfolding mission. In seed form, wheat has been a vital storage crop to many cultures, crossing oceans and continents in pockets and jars. However, once crushed into flour, it should be used as fresh as possible to honor the flavor and aroma.


The smallest portion of the berry, the germ, is packed with fats and fragrant oils. The embryonic heart, it is from here the taproot sprouts and growth begins. The endosperm makes up the majority of the overall berry, a starchy and protein heavy storehouse providing long-term nutrition as the grass grows. Residing in the endosperm are two important proteins: gliadin and glutenin. When hydrated, these proteins lock together in a web-like structure called gluten. Gliadin is responsible for the extensibility in a dough, while glutenin imparts elasticity. The bran, the visible outer coating of the berry, is a shield against the wilds.


PANTRY PORRIDGE


When water and flour combine, enzymatic activity breaks down starches into sugars. Yeasts metabolize the sugars, producing carbon dioxide and alcohol. This gas is the primary source of leavening in cultured goods. Bacteria, namely lactobacilli, create lactic and acetic acids and very little carbon dioxide or alcohol. A culture is simply the thick batter of flour and water that these yeasts and bacteria call home.

Engage with the dough in front of you, not the idea of it. Work with a loving attitude. To love in baking is to remain present. Herein lies the health benefit: the practice of caring. The quality of care you can extend to the bread is related to the quality of care you provide yourself.


Bread is a mix of flour and water, activated with leaven and controlled by salt, fermented and baked in a hot environment. Not much more than four ingredients are necessary to create a pleasing loaf.


Learning one simple dough well and practicing it repeatedly will lead to swift progress.


Our goal is a dough with final temperature between 75 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. This climate promotes the growth of strength and flavor in tandem. Too warm, and the bacterial benefits are hindered; too cold, and the yeast struggles to gain momentum.


In a time when a bag of chips can be labeled “artisanal,” I find it essential to give some integrity back to the word. Artisans are meant to transform themselves through their work. You cannot look like an artisan. You cannot even be an artisan. The artisanal path is an invisible process deep inside the wild darkness of your chest. The journey is never done and yet is always attempted. Growth and change are inevitable.


SMOKE SIGNALS CORE VALUES Are you breathing? Think of flour as fresh produce. Learn one recipe like the back of your hand. Art and science are meant to reinforce each other, not undermine each other. All binaries are false. Keep a journal and be observant. Work is the only truth. Learn to trust. Engage the intelligence of your body. Value the entire process, not just the final result. Strive, but take breaks. Keep a clear mind and a clean work space. Lived experience informs technique. Strength through diversity, not monoculture; be a little wild. The end is just the beginning.
