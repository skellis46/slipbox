# Seth Godin - This is Strategy

_previous note:_ [[godin on ideas]]

**Note that I reached a clipping limit so what is below is not even close to how many things I highlighted in the book**

Find three or four other people and start a group, in person or in Zoom. Meet once a week and make assertions, highlighting your fears and sharing your path. Surprisingly quickly, you’ll notice that you’re shifting your strategy.


Who will we become, who will we be of service to, and who will they help others to become This is strategy.


Once our basic needs for food, shelter and health are met, most people dance with three conflicting desires: •  Affiliation •  Status •  Freedom from fear


If you want to understand why someone makes a choice, look for what people actually want, not only the proxies and substitutes they say they want.


Don’t surrender your agency and revert to the numbing day-to-day grind of compliance. You can make things better.


Our project needs to be accepted by people who have the power to choose—and our job is to create the conditions for that to happen.


Working with a system is like having an assistant, eager and skilled, always making your work better. But working against a system can feel like someone is intentionally harming your project.


A river is more than water. There’s water in a lake, too. The essence of the river is the current. Paddling upstream is more difficult than going downstream. A snapshot shows you the water, but not its motion, not the relentless force as the water moves from here to there. The river flows. If you want to change the course of a river, you can try to build a dam, but those are expensive and can fail. The alternative is to dig a small channel that helps a river to go where it was going anyway. When you make it easier for the current to flow, the current will respond.


Any time that a person can benefit from engaging with a community, a system will evolve.


And even if we spend our days working as a soloist, we’re not alone. We’re part of a collective or an industry, a system to take inputs and outputs and turn them into something of value for all participants.


We can’t change capitalism. We can’t even put a dent into it. But we can change the incentives of consumers, employees and investors by creating different cultural boundaries and status roles that operate within the larger system.


We need a strategy because we can’t simply order the system to follow our wishes. Part of our cultural mythos is that each of us has unlimited agency, if we’re only willing to work hard enough, demand enough, and insist enough. But systems are resilient and systems push back.


The power you have lies somewhere between infinity and zero. It’s possible that you’ve accepted whatever arrives, adopting the posture of a cog or (worse) a victim. But we’re not powerless. Individuals organizing others with persistence and generosity change the world, and do it every day. With the right strategy and resources, we can make an impact. Sometimes.


It’s unlikely anything we build is going to be built from scratch. But with time and focus, we can find the leverage to alter systems we care about.


Information changes systems.


And yet, culture is the driver of most systems, and culture is the result of the interactions between and among people. Strategies stumble when they depend on someone with power dictating how things will occur. If you want to grow a garden, you’ll need to plant seeds, but it’s the ecosystem and the climate that will determine what happens after that. Our job is to find a plan and then create the conditions for our project to spread from person to person, within and across the systems that already exist.


And the game of finding a job engages with a system, one that’s defined by scarcity and opportunity. Each action the job seeker takes requires effort, and sometimes these actions over time turn into the job that they’re looking for.


Calling the project a game gives us a chance to depersonalize our work, to be more flexible in our approach, and most of all just to talk about it. Smart people have studied games—from nuclear proliferation and public health to poker—and we can learn from them.


Sometimes the best way to win is to help others succeed.


We often spend more time figuring out how to win the game we’re in instead of choosing which game to play in the first place.


And we are all farmers. The seeds you plant today won’t grow for weeks or months. The systems we support, the people we dance with, the ruckus we create—it’s not for today, it’s for tomorrow. We’re here, now, but we live in the future. We are making history.


The future counts on us to make it better. Strategy is the hard work of choosing what to do today to improve our tomorrow.


Either we make the system or the system makes us. Constructing a strategy connects our goals to our insight, amplified by our resources, and allows us to make a difference. Our blueprint is the actionable strategy we’re committing to.
