# Marcow-Speiser and Franklin - Authentic Movement as a Meditative Practice

_previous note:_

## LLM summary

> The article explores Authentic Movement as a meditative discipline grounded in mindfulness, witnessing and embodied awareness. Through the dynamic between mover and witness, it cultivates consciousness of the present moment, allowing bodily impulses and sensations to arise without judgment. The practice invites surrender into movement as a means of accessing both personal and transpersonal experience, merging attention, awareness and compassion. Drawing parallels with traditional meditation, it frames Authentic Movement as “meditation in motion,” where witnessing mirrors the meditative act of observing the mind’s fluctuations. The authors emphasise non-judgment, clarity of intention and ethical responsibility in the exchange between mover and witness. Ultimately, the practice opens a space of tabula rasa—an empty yet potentiated state in which self, other and collective experience interweave, fostering integration of body, mind and spirit and revealing the interconnectedness of all human experience.
