# Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman's OpenAI --  Karen Hao (2025) 

_previous note:_ [[AI and human causal reasoning]]

I had issues with Amazon so lost my clippings. Following is AI generated.

## Summary

**Core thesis:** The global AI boom -- especially as embodied by OpenAI under Sam Altman -- is not just about technology. It's a **power play**: a new form of **imperialism** that concentrates talent, capital, data, computational infrastructure, and narrative control in the hands of a few actors, at vast cost to society, democracy, labour rights, environmental sustainability, and epistemic diversity. Hao reframes AI not as a neutral scientific or economic phenomenon, but as **a geopolitical force shaped by human ambition, institutional incentives, and extractive dynamics akin to historical empires**.

## Structure & reporting:

- Draws on hundreds of interviews and documents to trace **OpenAI's evolution** -- from a nonprofit with an altruistic mission to a deeply influential, opaque corporate powerhouse backed by Microsoft and major capital. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_AI?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Highlights both **visionary rhetoric** (AGI salvation narratives) and **systemic realities**: how the "race for scale" drives decisions, shapes research priorities, and quenches independent scholarship. ([Screvi](https://screvi.com/highlights/empire-of-ai-dreams-and-nightmares-in-sam-altman-s-openai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Key themes

- **AI as neocolonial project:** Hao repeatedly uses "empire" as a metaphor -- not merely evocative, but structural -- to show how data, labor, and computational power are extracted and repurposed for profit and influence, often benefiting elite stakeholders at the expense of broader publics and communities. ([Screvi](https://screvi.com/highlights/empire-of-ai-dreams-and-nightmares-in-sam-altman-s-openai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Opaque governance:** The shift from "Open" in OpenAI toward secrecy, proprietary systems, and closed-door decision-making erodes public trust and democratic oversight.

- **Environmental & labor costs:** Massive compute infrastructures consume vast energy and water; low-paid workers in the Global South do critical yet undervalued tasks (like annotation and moderation). ([Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/karen-hao-how-ai-boom-became-new-imperial-frontier-2025-07-03/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- **Critique of scale-at-all-cost mentality:** Hao argues that bigger isn't always better -- smaller, more diverse models and participatory approaches could serve societal needs more equitably than the current monolithic system.
