# LaMothe - The Dancing Species

> What if humans are the primates whose capacity to dance (shared by some birds and mammals) was the signature strategy enabling the evolution of a distinctively large and interconnected brain, empathic heart and ecological adaptability? And what if dancing plays this role for humans not just in prehistoric times, but continuing into the present? What if humans are creatures who [evolved](https://aeon.co/videos/dance-seems-to-be-the-ultimate-frivolity-how-did-it-become-a-human-necessity) to dance as the enabling condition of their own bodily becoming? [@lamothe-2019-dancing n.pag.]

> Recent evidence for such a thesis is gathering across scientific and scholarly disciplines. Time and again, researchers are discovering the vital role played by bodily movement not only in the evolution of the human species, but in the present-day social and psychological development of healthy individuals. Moreover, it is not just bodily movement itself that registers as vital in these cases, but a threefold capacity: to notice and recreate movement patterns; to remember and share movement patterns; and to mobilise these movement patterns as a means for sensing and responding to whatever appears. This threefold capacity is what every dance technique or tradition exercises and educates.[@lamothe-2019-dancing n.pag.]

- but what is the relationship between dancing and bodily movement? And what kind of dancing is she talking about? "every dance technique or tradition".

>In this light, every dance technique or tradition appears as a stream of knowledge – an ever-evolving collection of movement patterns discovered and remembered for how well they hone the human capacity for movement-making. Most of all, dancing provides humans with the opportunity to learn how their movements matter. They can become aware of how the movements they make are training them – or not – to cultivate the sensory awareness required to empathise across species and with the Earth itself. In this regard, dance remains a vital art. From the perspective of bodily becoming, humans cannot not dance.[@lamothe-2019-dancing n.pag.]

- but this presupposes that someone who doesn't dance does not 'become'. It's kind of absurd.
