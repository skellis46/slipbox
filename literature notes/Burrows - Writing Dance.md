# Burrows - Writing Dance

_previous note:_

A small book containing a series of essays or extracts from previous work.

## Traces

> And the motor cortex throws up old stuff to help me  
> with new stuff  
> so nothing is untainted by history,  
> but history is the wrong word for it because it's  
> activating here and now  
> and the body makes no judgements about time.[@burrows-2022-writing p.11]

> And drunk-dancing at a wedding is unstable  
> but the illogic of it is also encoded somewhere.[@burrows-2022-writing p.14]

## Gallery 

> Such are the complexities of art-historical citation,  
> so different from the usual thievery of dance  
> where nobody really notices what's been and gone and  
> is here again,  
> and again but in different clothes.[@burrows-2022-writing p.17]

> I suppose this is what dance historian Ramsay Burt meant about the somatic,  
> that awareness of it arrived by the accident of dancers  
> doing less in performance  
> and so having more time to perceive, and I have plenty  
> of time.[@burrows-2022-writing p.19]

- note here re [[weber-fechner law]]

## Practice

> and that he'd forgotten the slow doing by which [Mette Edvardsen] had arrived – a slow doing she describes as being 'the dust that accumulates through the working'.

> And without too much preparation on the spur of the moment I shared the thought 'practice is a doing which is not yet art', but the exact meaning of what I intended to say only vaguely hovered, clouded with questions.[@burrows-2022-writing p.23]

> Chrysa Parkinson, whose work has focused particularly on practice, read what I'd written and wrote in the margin that she agreed practice is not an art object, but that nevertheless you art when you practice. She said, 'It's something about how the materials you practise with start to teach you. It's not just you diffing, it's the soil getting dug. It's the trowel or shovel talking back to your hand. Smell of the soil. Maybe the soil is urgent. You do the allotment every day because otherwise something will die, or not grow, or grow too much.' [@burrows-2022-writing p.24]

> ... I write a note on my phone saying 'practice is a ghost-like activity', by which I think I mean that this doing which is not yet art is inhabited always by the ghost of other work, which points insistently towards what might slip over into art.[@burrows-2022-writing p.25]

> The poet Michael Donaghy, writing about why poets follow certain formal practices, described their process as an enjoyment of what he called 'that serendipity provided by negotiation with a resistant medium'. [@burrows-2022-writing p.25]

## Research 

> There is an alternative picture of research that is a reality for many of us, in which intuition is the heart of creative practice and requires us to set off without a map into an unknown territory, intelligently, our eyes open, scouring the horizon for clues, with not a written proposal in sight and no assessment procedure possible. 

> A muddy field without a map, which can withstand the scientific but must also stand up for its own logic, grounded in a practice that can never prove itself, whatever promises we might make.[@burrows-2022-writing p.29]

## The dust that accumulates

- introduction re offer to describe insight gained from practice
- this section excellent for [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]

> Then might arrive into the room a whole heap of people, placed and times that perhaps start to look more like the accumulated mess it's really been. [@burrows-2022-writing p.42]  

> Moments of unfocus as well as focus, and the focus seems more like insight but it's hard to tell. [@burrows-2022-writing p.43]

## Writing towards a subject

- description of cumulative and somewhat arbitrary process of making _Rewriting_.
