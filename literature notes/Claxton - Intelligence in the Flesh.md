# Intelligence in the Flesh Why Your Mind Needs Your Body Much More Than It Thinks by Guy Claxton

We only believe in those thoughts which have been conceived not in the brain but in the whole body. W. B. Yeats, Essays and Introductions, 
Palgrave Macmillan, 1961, p. 235


If the body had been easier to understand, nobody would have thought that we had a mind. Richard Rorty


The recurring motif is this: we do not have bodies; we are bodies. If my body was different, I would be different.


my intelligent flesh has evolved, as part of its intelligence, strategies and capacities that I think of as my ‘mind’. I am smart precisely because I am a body. I don’t own it or inhabit it; from it, I arise.


I’ll demonstrate that we are fundamentally built for action, not for thinking or understanding, and that, as a consequence, our intelligence is deeply orientated towards the construction of effective and appropriate behaviour.


Feelings are somatic events that embody our values and concerns.


Without physical feelings and intuitions, abstract intelligence sheers away from the subtleties and complexities of the real world, and people become ‘clever-stupid’, able to explain and comprehend but incapable of linking that understanding to the needs and pressures of everyday life.


From birth till death, the body is the moment-to-moment substrate of our thoughts and desires – however refined.


Informally, instinctively, we know that mental and bodily events resonate tightly with each other – but all these somatic reactions are no mere accoutrements of the mental activities they accompany; they are absolutely of the essence.


Consciousness has its own priorities – creating a semblance of order and self-esteem, for example – which lead it, often, to misrepresent the complexity and waywardness of what is going on below. We confabulate much more than we like to think.

**Note:** He is conflating C with Selfhood


As Andy Clark puts it, ‘we make our worlds smart so we can be dumb in peace’.


The more the digital world takes hold, the stronger, for many of us, seems the compensatory desire to get back from the virtual to the real, from the symbolic to the material. And this signals a re-esteeming of physical delicacy, sensibility and creativity (beyond those protected ‘Sites of Special Cultural Interest’ called sport and art). Craft is cognition, people are saying. Doing and thinking are not separate faculties; they are inextricably entwined.


For the body to be at its most intelligent, it has to be properly ‘strung’. The different sub-systems need to be able to talk to each other both directly and via the chat-room of the brain. If these circuits are not able, quite literally, to pick up each other’s vibes, then sympathetic resonance doesn’t happen, the quality of available information is reduced, and the overall harmony of the total system that we are is degraded.


But we can also lose harmony by dampening our ‘interoceptive awareness’, and for this visceral intelligence to be rehabilitated, physical exercise needs to be accompanied by efforts to refocus and sharpen our attention. Dance, yoga and t’ai chi all have proven effects on cognitive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving, for example.


Finally in Chapter 12 we will round up the implications of embodiment both for individual well-being and for the nature of the over-intellectualised, somatically impoverished institutions that surround us.


Re-establishing a balanced, embodied society will be tricky, to put it mildly, and will take gradual shifts in understanding by us all.


There are myriad processes in the body that never lead to conscious experience, but there is no real, identifiable place or agent inside us that is a separate source of impetus from consciousness and reason.


They include Roy Porter’s Flesh in the Age of Reason, Evan Thompson’s Mind in Life, Francisco Varela and others’ The Embodied Mind, Mark Johnson’s The Meaning of the Body, Andy Clark’s Being There: Putting Brain, Body and World Together Again, Shaun Gallagher’s How the Body Shapes the Mind and Mark Rowlands’ The New Science of the Mind. I have pilfered part of my title from George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s Philosophy in the Flesh, and many ideas from Antonio Damasio’s Descartes’ Error and Self Comes to Mind.


There are also three excellent recent books on craft and practical intelligence that I want to mention as well – Matthew Crawford’s The Case for Working with Your Hands, Richard Sennett’s The Craftsman and Mike Rose’s The Mind at Work. None of these, though, situates the renewed interest in physical making within the emerging science of embodied cognition.


Bodies do not reveal themselves much to the observing eye (or ‘I’) of conscious awareness – largely because eyes are the very tools whereby that awareness comes about.


Even when our body-brains do make their products known to consciousness, their processes remain silent and invisible. So it is no wonder that we have underestimated our bodies. It is not that bodies are simple – far from it. It is just that it is extremely hard to notice their complexity.


When we come to replace the disembodied notion of mind with an embodied alternative – the idea that the mind, the organ of intelligence, is the body – we are not just changing theories, therefore, we are challenging and upending very basic, largely hidden assumptions about our very nature.


As a case in point, Peter Medawar and Paul Feyerabend showed many years ago that the actual way in which scientists work is completely different from the neat, logical picture that the published scientific paper suggests.16


I am body entirely, and nothing beside. Friedrich Nietzsche


Much of what is happening inside us is not accessible to consciousness – you can’t feel the red blood cells being manufactured in your bone marrow as you are reading – so we will need the help of science to get a handle on what bodies are and how they work. I’ll briefly introduce a number of complementary perspectives.


At our most basic level, we are purposeful – and intelligent. As Antonio Damasio says in his book Self Comes to Mind, ‘embodied knowledge of life management precedes the conscious experience of any such knowledge. [This] knowledge is quite sophisticated … its complexity is huge and its seeming intelligence remarkable’.


Asleep or awake, if our brain functioned, our bodies moved. Jeffrey Deaver2


The body isn’t a thing, it’s an event. We exist by happening.


As neuroscientist Daniel Wolpert puts it:3 While sensory, memory and cognitive processes are all important, they are only so because they either drive or suppress future movements. There can be no evolutionary advantage to laying down childhood memories or perceiving the colour of a rose if it doesn’t affect the way you are going to move later in life.


The reason we have a brain is mainly to figure out and implement the right movement to make, given our current concerns, and this is a complicated problem.


The physical manifestation of the body is primary. The stuff of intelligence has evolved in conjunction with that body, and is a modulator of its behaviour, rather than a primary and central control system. Rodney Brooks


Pfeifer sums up this important insight thus: Fig. 2 The robotic Puppy. Behaviour is the result of an agent interacting with the real world, which includes not only the agent’s neural system but its entire body: how the sensors are distributed, the material properties of the muscle-tendon system and the joints, and so on. This collection of interdependent mechanisms [we can call] the agent’s embodiment.8


The idea that intelligence can be embodied in physical structures, and that such structures can therefore take some of the strain off minds and brains, is a key one in the science of embodied cognition.


As Raymond Tallis puts it, in typically droll fashion: ‘If Adam and Eve had been expelled from Paradise with paws instead of hands, the history of the human race would have been unimaginably different.’9 Where would we have been without our ability to grasp, caress, pluck, catch, pull, twist, pinch, prod, punch, rub, scratch, tap, drum, throw, write, squeeze, tickle and dozens of other manually clever things?


The musculoskeletal system has many movable parts, and they must work in concert. Some of this needs delicate central orchestration by the brain, but again the brain modulates what the body is doing rather than having to design it from scratch.


If we are to uncover the intelligence of the body, we will have to overcome our Platonic squeamishness and dive into our moist innards.


The Chilean immunologist Francisco Varela, whose work has been seminal in the development of the whole area of embodied cognition, says that the immune system is really there to keep knitting the various specialist groups within the body into a single somatic identity.15


For centuries we have taken the vocabulary of medicine and used it to think about how our bodies are structured. But it turns out that the language of distinct organs and systems does not do justice to the coherence and interwoven nature of the body. More than that, it blinds us to the essentially systemic nature of our bodily selves.


In a System, any apparent boundary or membrane that seems to mark the limits of a Sub-System isn’t a barrier or a stockade; it is a site of constant, vital interaction. If nations retreat into protectionism, and international trade stops, then life within the national borders must adapt. Under siege, life has to change or it stops.


So each System is only the way it is because it is an aspect of a Super-System. The heart beats as it does because it is listening to the rhythms and cadences of the gut and the lungs. I am as I am because I am constantly being licked into shape by the air I breathe, the food I digest, the birdsong in the garden I can hear and the shifting quality of the relationship I have with my wife.


So from the CADS perspective, the human body is not a noun, it’s a verb. We aren’t like billiard balls that meet, collide and ricochet off unchanged. We are confections constantly being whipped up by a combination of the Super-Systems in which we are participating and the Sub-Systems of which we are composed. We are like whirlpools and eddies in a river that cannot be taken home in a bucket.


Brain, n. An apparatus with which we think we think. Ambrose Bierce1


As bodies get more complicated they need ways to coordinate what is going in their different limbs and organs. But they also need to coordinate all of that with what is going on around them. In order to behave intelligently, we have to be sensitive to what is going on in the Super-Systems that surround us. To do that, we have evolved a range of ways of resonating with this big wide world: our special senses. And the most important of these is touch.


We know the world, to a considerable extent, by remembering how it will feel if we stroke it, pinch it, prod it or tickle it. Through active touching we get the world to reveal itself, and we register those discoveries.


This is how all our senses work: by generating these interwoven webs of expectation that link movement to sensation


According to the work of vision scientists such as Alva Noë and Kevin O’Regan, the visual world is not really a wraparound cinema screen; it’s that web of expectations that link movements of my eyes and head to changing visual sensations.5


This way of looking at vision is a shock to the Cartesian view of perception. We naively think of vision as giving us largely unproblematic, objective access to the world around us, uncontaminated by considerations of subjective need. We see what’s there, right, and then evaluate it and respond to it. We see ‘seeing’ as a receptive process, just noticing ‘what’s there’. But this way of looking at seeing obscures its deep relationship to doing and needing. To see, we need the world to rub against those specialised bits of skin called eyes – or our eye-skin to actively rub against the world, identifying its textures and edges.


If we think of visual perception as decoupled from the other two aspects of the body, doing and needing, we are encouraged to view it as the closest of all our senses to that disembodied and dispassionate ‘mind’. ‘I see’, we say, when we mean we understand. Research on vision in psychology and physiology vastly outweighs that on all the other senses put together – because of its Cartesian bias.


In fact Damasio and his colleagues have found that the EDA can be a more sensitive indicator of our thinking than our conscious minds are. Intelligence is a whole-body happening!8


Even when I am apparently still, perception is dynamic.


Our bodies are defined, broadly, by three sets of considerations. The first, and most basic, is: what do I need? At every moment, the body is alive with a variety of concerns and priorities, all of which have a degree of urgency.


Generally, though, in the course of growing up we develop a rather large and entangled range of priorities. They constitute a substantial, fluctuating, partly conflicting portfolio of concerns: all the things I have on my plate right now. Let’s call these our Needs, for short.


Second, there is the collection of my reflexes, skills and capabilities: the know-how I possess, all the way from deeply embedded and unconscious regulation of my blood-sugar levels (assuming I am not a diagnosed diabetic) to the learned expertise that enables me to concoct a tasty meal out of left-overs, or indeed write a book.


These skills in toto constitute my portfolio of capabilities. For short, I’ll call them my potential Deeds.


And finally there is, at every moment, a portfolio of opportunities being revealed by my senses. Let’s call them See’ds.


Perception’s job is scoping out the possible ‘theatre of action’ – a sense of all the things that current circumstances permit me to do – so that I can select and craft my actions appropriately


At any moment I am a buzzing swarm of Needs, Deeds and See’ds. And my job – the function of my intelligence – is to resolve all this shimmering mish-mash of information into an answer to the perennial, deceptively simple-sounding question: ‘What is the best thing to do next (all things considered)?’


And this means that, far from Needs (motivation), Deeds (action) and See’ds (perception) being three separate compartments, in need of being tied together by ‘the mind’, they are in fact knitted tightly together in the structure and functioning of the body-mind itself. Brains evolved to support their bodies in doing that knitting. Brains evolved to help increasingly complicated, mobile bodies deal with problems of coordination and communication that they could not solve on their own.


That intelligence pervades the body and its servant, the brain. The brain is the central information exchange of the body where these three swarms of factors can come together and, through communication, agree on a plan. The brain does not issue commands; it hosts conversations.


As a result of lots of previous actions, my movements are partially and automatically encoded in terms of their anticipated effects on perception.11

**Note:** Key. Part of dance training doing this? Losing Oneself


Hoping, wanting and fearing are already dissolved in perception, in other words. We don’t have to add them in deliberately.14


In fact, we could see the deep structure of the brain in terms not of Needs, Deeds and See’ds but in terms of a different set of basic concepts that have already combined these (see Figure 6). If we meld perceptions and actions – if we see perception as deeply imbued with the possibilities for action – we could call the result affordances. An affordance is a scene already parsed in terms of the things I could possibly do. If we blend perceptions with our concerns, we might call these opportunities. An opportunity is an aspect of the world seen in the light of my current needs, interests or values. And if we combine actions and concerns, we could speak of intentions. An intention is an incipient action that already has a sense not just of possibility but of purpose.


It takes further work by a sophisticated nervous system to pull affordances, opportunities and intentions apart, and decouple perception, action and motivation from each other.


Fig. 6 The integration of Needs, Deeds and See’ds.


That’s why, as the great psychologist William James, observed, every moment of our conscious lives is not just ‘here now’, but is infused with a continuing sense of the impending and the receding. To coin a phrase, time past and time future are both contained in time present.


The third dimension, however, is the really important one for our discussion here. It runs from the innermost core of the brain, the brain stem, upwards through the structures of the limbic system to the outer ‘shell’ of the brain, the neocortex. This core-to-shell dimension carries information about needs and concerns – matters of personal significance – from the signalling systems of the body up into the outer regions of the brain where it is progressively integrated with information arriving through the senses, and also with the developing organisation of appropriate motor responses. And then messages are sent in the reverse direction, back down the chain to the brain’s core, whence the information can affect what is going on in the recesses of the body in the light of that centralised conversing and decision-making.


According to the emerging perspectives of embodied cognition, the body is self-governing. It is like a medieval moot, a meeting that can reach a conclusion only by a process of respectful and attentive debate. A ‘moot point’ is one to which there is no easy or obvious answer and which therefore has to be referred to the moot.


Coughing, sneezing, laughing and even yawning produce pressure waves in the body that (as well as squeezing the bladder) pump cerebrospinal fluid up to the brain, and increase blood flow, both of which change the concentrations of hormones and neurotransmitters that are swirling around the neurons and synapses. Orgasm and straining on the toilet may have analogous effects.3


Most organs, including the brain, are elastic and respond to whole-body movement with movements of their own. At the most gross level, a knockout blow to the head induces loss of consciousness, though why and how this happens is not yet known. At the micro level, every cell in the body is influenced by mechanical forces as the body and its different sub-systems twist and turn, tighten and relax, shake and tremble. Many functions of the cell – division, membrane permeability and gene expression, to name but three – are influenced by physical movement. In the brain, neurons physically twitch and turn when they are activated, and their axons propagate small pressure waves, as well as electrical and chemical ones. There are many protein molecules in the brain that both generate movement and respond to it. This small-scale physical activity may well affect the way messages are routed in the brain and the way neurons learn. A little is known about these mechanical effects, but this is a new field of research and a great deal remains to be discovered.


The nuclei in the lower and middle parts of the brain start out by mapping quite specific features of the body. Some make maps of the current position and state of tension of the limbs, or of the overall state of physical balance of the body. Some distil information about the state of the body’s different needs, for example on glucose levels, blood oxygenation, temperature and lactate levels in the muscles. Some record injuries and illnesses and draw out information that may surface into consciousness, after the maps have been redrawn a dozen times, as feelings of aches and pains or nausea. And some extract descriptions of the different kinds of touch that are occurring at the surface of the body: touches to the skin, to the lining of the nose, to the taste buds, to the tiny bones and muscles of the ears and the photosensitive skin, the retina, at the back of each eye.


Though these loops and maps are widely distributed round the brain and the body as a whole, there obviously needs to be a place where the high-level representatives of the body’s various systems, their ‘ambassadors’, so to say, can confer. And there are indeed two structures that play a pivotal role in integrating these sources of information: the insula and the cingulate cortex. The cingulate wraps around the large bundle of fibres called the corpus callosum that connects the two hemispheres of the brain and so is ideally placed to collect and redistribute information from a wide range of sources. (Cingulum means belt in Latin.)


Bud Craig, a researcher at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, has a good deal of evidence to back his claim that the posterior part of the insula creates an overall sense of how things are in the visceral parts of the body.13 Then, as patterns of neural firing are passed forward towards the front of the insula, this ‘primary interoceptive representation’, as Craig calls it, is integrated with other patterns coming from the muscles (‘proprioception’), from the predictions and expectations alive in the higher centres of the neocortex, and eventually from the outside world. All this culminates, in the anterior insula, in what he calls a ‘global emotional moment’: the composite background feeling of ‘how I am, right now’. It is the integrated sense which we refer to when someone says, ‘How are you?’ and we answer ‘lousy’, ‘a bit off colour’, ‘so-so’, ‘pretty chipper’ or, as my New Zealander friends are prone to say when feeling particularly well, ‘like a box of fluffy ducks, mate’.14


Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee summarise the research that shows how different areas of the brain cooperate in this way: The sensory maps of your parietal lobe are also de facto motor centres, with massive direct interlinkage to the frontal motor system. They don’t simply pass information to the motor system, they participate directly in action. They actively transform vision, sound, touch, balance, and other sensory information into motor intentions and actual movements. And by the same token, the maps of the motor system play a fundamental role in interpreting the sensations from your body. Your parietal lobe is not purely sensory, and your frontal lobe is not purely motor. Physical sensation and action are best seen as a single sense that, like a coin, has two inseparable faces with different appearances.15 (emphasis added)


Craig puts it more formally: ‘Cortical integration of high-resolution information on the state of the body provides improved conditions [to] guide behaviour ever more efficiently.’16 He argues that there is a clear evolutionary parallel, seen in different animals, between improved ability to select and control fluid responses and the development of this ‘high-resolution’ analysis of bodily states and needs in the insula. The anterior insula and the anterior cingulate are intimately interconnected, and almost always active at the same time. Together at the place where the various loops of information come together, the insula takes the lead on defining ‘what’s so’, and the cingulate leads on designing ‘what to do about what’s so’.


Our actions in the world are, broadly, of two kinds. There is action on the world, when we are at close quarters. I might pinch it, unwrap it, kick it, play it, fight it, drink from it, type on it or paint it. For this type of action, my body is the origin, the subject so to speak, and action emanates from this centre, so I need an egocentric map. From this perspective, ‘objects’ – such as an ‘audience’ or a ‘leg of lamb’ – are seen in terms of their affordances for beneficial manipulation


But there is also action that enables me to move through the world so I can get where I want or need to be. In this frame, my body itself is an ‘object’ that travels through space, so I need a map in which I can locate myself as one object amongst an array of others. This is called an allocentric map. This map is more ‘objective’: it is like a chessboard on which I am the White King surrounded by other pieces, some benign and some hostile.


Each of the possible courses of action under consideration gets tagged with a number of indicators that will help the brain to do its job of conducting the somatic orchestra. How important is it to achieve the goal of that action? How urgent is it? How much cost or effort will be involved in executing the plan? How risky is it: what could we lose if the plan fails or goes wrong? How likely is it to go wrong: how sure are we that we can ‘pull it off’? And how sure are we that the information on which the plan is based is reliable? These tags are what Antonio Damasio calls ‘somatic markers’, because they rely on information in and from the body. They involve estimations of value, significance, apprehension, confidence and risk, which are all emotional issues.


Remember that three sets of factors, each of them potentially complicated, have to be resolved together: the Needs, Deeds and See’ds. Sometimes the solution to this multivariate equation is clear-cut. There is an overwhelmingly urgent and important need (‘Stop the car, I’m going to be sick’ easily trumps ‘But we’re already half an hour late for dinner’). Or there is only one course of action open to me (‘No, Mr Bond; I expect you to die …’). But often the competition is more of a close-run thing, and then the relative strengths of the tags have to be taken into account and the knockout rounds begin. Important but not so urgent? You can go on the standby list.

**Note:** Useful for Losing Oneself - decision .aming?


If the choir decides that we need to stick with a single programme for the time being, attention to all those exciting new possibilities is dampened down and I become impervious to distractions. These shifting, strategic patterns of inhibition make some concerns stand in line and allow others to go ahead. They manage attention so that it becomes focused and selective (as opposed to broad, inclusive or distractible). They turn some sources of information up and others down (so we can swivel the spotlight of awareness from the rumblings in the stomach to the sound of the birds, and back to the words on the screen).


There is an important corollary of this retardation. When inhibition stops an action flowing down into the muscles, or out into the lips and throat, it turns an overt action into an imagined action, or an actual utterance into a covert thought. And this, as we shall see in Chapter 8, creates the breeding conditions for both consciousness and creativity.23


As these high-level maps arrive at the neocortex they are further integrated with information arriving from all the special senses about the state of the outside world, and with more information about what types of action might be available and appropriate. In the anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate and the premotor cortex, processes are applied to these representations that sort out competing priorities and decide on which action plans will go forward for full-scale implementation. If the stakes are high, other frontal lobe processes monitor the implementation to see if any unexpected glitches or unintended consequences are appearing, ready to slam on the brakes and ‘think’ again.

**Note:** Stakes are not high. Also available and appropriate is so useful  appropriate! In a non goal directed activity


The most obvious place where we experience our bodies, brains and minds coming together is in our emotional lives. Emotions involve muscles and glands, blood, sweat and tears, as well as thoughts, memories and imaginings.


We must begin by seeing emotions as contributing to our ability to act intelligently, not as impediments to such action.


This model of subversion, antagonism and domination even found its way into popular neuroscience for a while. A 1960s model of the ‘triune’ brain divided it into three layers: the ‘reptilian brain’ that comprised the basic life-support systems, the ‘limbic system’ that dealt with the emotions, and then the ‘neocortex’, or the rational brain, that did all the clever and honourable things and kept its two more primitive partners in check. When people got upset or afraid or angry it represented the brain ‘downshifting’ from the rational to the emotional, and our better nature struggled to shift it back up again. The job of the neocortex was to govern the rest of the brain, just as the job of the ‘mind’ was to govern the body.


Either emotional intelligence is presented as if it were an intelligence about emotion, involving skilful control of emotion through techniques such as ‘anger management’; or EI is seen as a kind of intelligence of emotion that is separate from other kinds of intelligence such as rational, linguistic or even ‘bodily-kinaesthetic’ intelligence.2


The general view now is that our basic emotions are built-in ‘default settings’ of our whole embodied Systems. We feel emotional when we perceive something as belonging to a class of events that has a characteristic kind of significance.


Though they come in many shades, emotions are intelligent responses to events that are relevant to what we value – and what we value has its roots firmly in the physical body.


These whole ‘body+brain+sensors’ reactions are so intricately interwoven that it is impossible for us to pull them apart and tell what is ‘cause’ and what is ‘effect’. The circular loops connecting body and brain are bi-directional, so that ‘higher’ processes are influencing ‘lower’ ones, at the same time as the ‘lower’ are feeding information up to the ‘higher’. Words like ‘resonance’ and ‘reverberation’ capture this shimmering complexity much better than ideas of ‘stimulus’ and ‘response’.


Whereas the ‘negative’ modes get us to fixate on what is wrong, and how to fix it, in enquiry mode we are more open-minded and creative. We are built to explore and learn, to enhance our ability to ‘know our way about’, because you never know when such informed competence might be useful.


In anxiety mode – in the way I am using the term here – you are unsure which of the emotional modes it is appropriate to engage. Is it a trick or a treat? Can I escape (fear) or should I stay and fight it out (anger)? Is the loss really irrecoverable (sorrow) or are there things to investigate before I come to that conclusion (enquiry)? Can I find someone to blame (anger) or is it my fault (shame)? In these terms, anxiety – like all the other more focused modes – is often appropriate and intelligent.


As American business guru Tom Peters once pointed out to an audience of executives, working in highly complex environments, ‘If you’re not confused, you’re not paying attention’.12


Note that I have said nothing yet about consciousness. All of these modes can operate perfectly well at the physiological and behavioural levels without any need for conscious supervision, or even awareness.


Conversely, the emotion we feel is powerfully influenced by the psychological spin we put on the context in which we find ourselves. People who have become anxious as a result of crossing a rickety bridge feel stronger physical attraction to a good-looking young researcher who stops them for an interview. They experience their arousal not as anxiety, linked to the bridge, but as desire, linked to the person they meet. (If they haven’t just walked over the bridge, people don’t find the same interviewer so attractive.)14

**Note:** Midlifikng


Admiration is the experience of desiring to possess some of the character traits – beauty, wit, kindness – of the admired person. Envy is admiration with a dose of disdain mixed in.


We might note that, even though some of these blended emotions are commonly seen as quite ‘refined’ – hallmarks of cultured human beings – they can still be traced back to their roots in the body and the brain. Damasio and his colleagues have shown that admiration, as well as the feeling of compassion, activates brain–body loops that are associated with the regulation of the internal milieu (gut function, heart rate and so on). As our emotional lives become more subtle and sophisticated, they retain their rootedness in the physical workings of the body.17


We lived in fear of tipping her over into one of ‘Mum’s turns’: a hysterical meltdown that would take days to pass. Mum was doing her best, and it was our job not to question or object to it, whatever it was, so as not to trigger the underlying insecurity. This meant that any display of assertion or dissent by me was taboo; my job was to be Sunny Jim and radiate, as my mother put it, ‘sweetness and light’. I am still in recovery from this inescapable training, finding it hard, to this day, to be assertive without becoming aggressive, especially with the people who matter to me most.


As Aristotle said: ‘Anybody can become angry – that is easy; but to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way – that is not within everybody’s power and is not easy.’19


But many techniques for emotional self-management directly involve the body. After all, e-motion is strongly connected with motion. Emotion’s job is to prepare us for action; and emotions themselves often involve overt physical movement.


Second, the inhibition of expressiveness – resulting in a tense or wooden demeanour – often has social consequences. Giving less of ourselves away and presenting a rigid persona, we become harder to know, and intimacy and warm friendship may suffer. We know that when we are in formal situations our body language becomes inhibited; but when we have become ‘inhibited’, in the everyday sense of the word, we carry that formality around with us.23


If you record the activity in people’s facial muscles as they are looking at photos of emotional faces, those whose own muscles resonate slightly with the emotion they are seeing identify it better. If you have learned to keep a poker face, whatever the stress of the situation you are in, you inhibit that resonance, and so are less well attuned to the state of those around you. The partners of habitual suppressors experience less rapport during their conversations.


If you are asked to hold a pencil in your mouth using your lips, you have to pucker up to do it. It is almost impossible to do this and smile at the same time. Conversely, if you have to hold the pencil using only your teeth, most people stretch the corners of their mouth out in a way that looks rather like a smile, and so are less able to pout or look sad. Paula Niedenthal has reported that these two manoeuvres selectively affected people’s ability to read sad or happy faces. If your mouth is set in a pout, you are better at identifying the sad faces and worse at the happy ones; if you are forced to smile, the reverse.26


In general, people who are habitual repressers of their emotions also report more memory problems in everyday life.

But no other animal, as far as we know, is moved to tears by a Mozart aria, or by witnessing undeserved kindness between people we do not know. The ability to be touched and moved by such things must surely count as amongst our more refined – some would even say spiritual – capacities; yet they manifest not as reasoned understanding, but as the overflowing of a weak saline disinfectant fluid from the sockets of the eyes. What further proof could we want that our highest sentiments are intimately connected with the workings of the body?


Grief too may be accompanied by seemingly unstoppable floods of tears, but may also be dry. We can weep with frustration, with rage, with joy, with relief and with sympathy – as well as with sadness, pain and distress.


It is as if the crying is a literal counterpart to an emotional overflowing; an inability to contain the intensity. We know that in the build-up to crying there is increasingly intense activity in the sympathetic nervous system; but the parasympathetic brake may also be ‘on’, trying to restrain a public display of emotion that we may feel to be ‘weak’, ‘unmanly’ or just inappropriate.


A recent study showed that smelling a woman’s tears, without knowing her or even being able to see her, caused a drop in testosterone and an increase in oxytocin in male volunteers.


To recap: at the core of our being there is a deep churning flux of bodily concerns, capabilities and activities. Via a host of different pathways, information about this turmoil loops up into the brain and makes contact with the opportunities and affordances for action that seem to be available in the current environment. Out of this meeting emerges, moment by moment, a provisional decision about which broad emotional mode is most appropriate. We are set to rest, or flee, or intimidate or join the rescue party. From this mode, the specifics of thought, action and perception then emerge. Memories are retrieved, plans are laid, words are chosen, attention is swivelled in one direction rather than another … and finally our first-choice action is implemented and we wait to see if it has the desired effect. All this fleshing out of the details of our response occurs within the broad emotional/motivational frame our body-brain has selected, and it is this final ‘dotting of i’s and crossing of t’s’ that psychologists generally call cognition. But it is the whole process that deserves the name of ‘intelligence’, not just the finishing touches.


And people who are more sensitive to their momentary visceral state recall emotional words and pictures better than those who are less sensitive. On the other hand the ‘stress hormone’ cortisol interferes with memory for facts and events.


Happy people not only pay less attention to detail, they are also more prone to incorporate misleading information, suggested to them after the event, into their actual memory of the event. Basically, when we are happy we tend to notice and recall what we think is plausible rather than what actually happened: both perception and memory are strongly tinted by our own prior knowledge, opinions and expectations.


The authors suggest an interesting interpretation: that reasoning is hard work, and it is only when you care enough about the subject that you are sufficiently motivated to make the effort to ‘get it right’.


So: behaviour begins to improve at the same time as the body begins to react differently to the four packs, but only later is there any conscious comprehension of what is going on. Their bodies – skin reactions and actual physical choices – are learning faster than their minds.


Without feelings and intuitions, abstract intelligence loses touch with the place within us, deep in our bodies, where our concerns, needs and values are held.


Far from being a kind of unwelcome interruption to intelligent action, emotions are the bridge that connects our cleverness to our embodied core values.


Follow-up studies have shown that performance on the Iowa task is reduced, not just for people with obvious brain damage, but for those of us whose somatic markers are weak, or who are relatively insensitive to our own internal states. It is only people who show the raised skin conductance who perform well on the task. The weaker your visceral response, the longer it takes you to pick up on what is going on.35 Interestingly, self-awareness makes a difference too. If your skin and heart show good responses to the bad packs, but your awareness of those responses is weak, you also perform more poorly.36


MIND, n. a mysterious form of matter secreted by the brain. Its chief activity consists in the endeavour to ascertain its own nature, the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing but itself to know itself with. Ambrose Bierce


Human intelligence is traditionally associated most strongly with activities that possess some or all of the following characteristics. They are articulate: that is, they involve the use of language and/or other kinds of symbols such as mathematical or scientific. Second, they are abstract: they involve concepts that are less closely or less obviously tied to concrete experience. Third, they are rational: they involve processes of reasoning or analysis whose validity can be checked by other people. Fourth, they are conscious and deliberate: that is, they seem to take place in the well-lit workroom of consciousness under the control of the internal thinker or critic. Fifth, they are likely to feel effortful, rather than smooth and automatic.


If we understand body well enough, the need for frameworks and languages that appeal to disembodied mental processes disappears. (Philosophers call this view eliminative materialism.)


If I pick up from my mother a fear of cats, every time Timmy comes round, my registered pattern will be ‘Timmy + Be Scared’. Be Scared will be, in Damasio’s terms, Timmy’s ‘somatic marker’. The important point here is that even ‘Timmy’, solid and furry though he is, is an abstraction from experience. There is no abrupt hiatus between ‘concrete things’ and ‘abstract concepts’.


As I learn, my body-brain distils thousands of these abstractions, and we can imagine a number of strata emerging in the memory-laden circuitry of the body-brain. At the bottom are the millions of individual momentary impressions, each one a unique constellation of perception, action and concern. Call it the Impression Bank (or, as I think of it more informally, the Compost Heap).


Real events always involve a mix of perceptions, actions and concerns, but these maps, with their different kinds of abstractions – concepts, habits and values – enable us to partially decouple those different elements. We become able to look at objects with a more dispassionate eye. We can wander round an art gallery just looking, without needing to do anything about what we see. We develop the ability to ponder on our feelings and motivations in the absence of immediate calls to action (as in a counselling session or a heart-to-heart conversation). We can act ‘for the joy of it’ without having to evaluate the consequences of our actions (as in unselfconscious dancing).


The (partial, variable) ability to decouple perceiving from desiring, desiring from acting, and acting from perceiving brings added freedom – and added complexity.


Words are ways of activating neural circuitry (and altering biochemical processes) through speech and writing.


If you read ‘Jane forgot the calculator’, your brain automatically readies itself to make the kind of movements involved in pressing keys. If you read (as you are now doing), ‘Mike spotted the kettle’, your brain quite involuntarily activates the gesture of grasping a handle.


We make sense of the world, even when it is rather abstract, by getting ready to act on it or interact with it. The sensori-motor part of the brain provided the original platform for the development of more abstract cognition and comprehension, and continues to do so throughout life.


The interconnection of the abstract and the concrete reveals itself in how we behave, as well as in what is going on in our minds. We can change the way we think, feel and behave just by changing our posture or our breathing, for example. I can quickly make myself feel sad or frightened just by deliberately making deep sighs, or by breathing in a shallow, juddery sort of way. (If you have never tried this, have a go. It can be quite dramatic.) Intriguingly, a study from Turkey has shown that one important aspect of people’s intelligence as measured by a standard test (Cattell’s Culture Fair Intelligence Test) is significantly correlated with the depth of their normal (unselfconscious) breathing.15 Even more startling, another study has found that people make better choices when they are controlling the need to pee! The theory is that the exertion of self-control spills over (as it were) from the physical realm into the cognitive, and enables people to restrain their more impulsive sides.16


Telling people to adopt different postures has a rapid effect on their bodies and their minds. When people are induced to slump in their chair, they feel less pride in their performance; they think less carefully about problems; they take their own thoughts less seriously; and they show less resilience in the face of difficulty.17 Conversely, sitting up straight and crossing your arms makes you feel more stubborn. People with crossed arms persevered twice as long in solving anagram puzzles and were more successful than people with their arms by their sides.


Dana Carney and her colleagues had people adopt either a ‘high-power’ (relaxed, upright) or a ‘low-power’ (slumped, constricted) pose for two minutes. Then they took part in a gambling game where they could play either safe or risky. Of those who had been standing or sitting in the high-power posture 86 per cent took the risky bet; only 60 per cent of the low-power people did so. Deliberately adopting the posture makes that association come true. Carney showed that the posturing – only two minutes, remember – also affected hormone levels. In the confident posture, testosterone increased by 20 per cent and cortisol (the stress hormone) went down by 10 per cent. In the submissive pose, the reverse was true: testosterone went down by 25 per cent and cortisol up by 15 per cent. Postures are associated with more abstract personality traits such as confidence or timidity. There is a non-arbitrary relationship between the idea of standing upright, with its connotations of being tall, proud and unashamed, and the metaphorical idea of an upright or upstanding character. And, by the way, the magnitude of these effects is different for different people. Some people seem to have managed to disconnect their minds from their bodies more than others.18


Don Tucker makes the case strongly in his book Mind from Body: Experience from Neural Structure: The brain evolved to regulate the motivational control of actions that are carried out by the motor systems and guided by sensory evaluations of ongoing environmental events. There are no faculties of memory, conscious perception or musical appreciation that float in the mental ether, separate from the bodily functions … [All] our behaviour and experience must be conceived of as elaborations of primordial systems for perceiving, evaluating and acting. When we study the brain to look for the networks controlling cognition, we find that all of [them] are linked in one way or another to sensory systems, motor systems and/or motivational systems.28


One of the major errors of twentieth-century psychology was to suppose that there are childish ways of knowing which are outgrown, and ought to be transcended, as one grows up. The childish ones are the bodily ones, and are to do with concrete action and experience. The grown-up ones are abstract, logical and propositional. But it is a Cartesian mistake to think that, once you have mastered logic, you don’t need the body any more. Yes, new ways of thinking and knowing do emerge. But they emerge from more immediate, embodied ways, and are continuous with them. We should think of the developing mind as a tree that grows new branches, not as a spaceship whose booster rockets fall away for ever once they have done their job and are spent.


So we need to ask: where does consciousness come from; when does consciousness accompany somatic activity; what is it good for; and when and why are we sometimes better off without it? Let me be clear. I am not going to attempt what philosophers like to call ‘the hard problem of consciousness’ – what consciousness is, in its own right, and why we have conscious experience at all.


I am going to offer two alternative metaphors for consciousness that I will call ‘unfurling’ and ‘welling up’.


In this metaphor, there is a core sense of a self-organising, dynamic process of development. There is no fully formed ‘unconscious thought’ that merely has to leap on to the stage, or on to which we can shine a light.


This perspective on the formation of ideas, acts and experiences was originally dubbed ‘microgenesis’ by Heinz Werner in 1956.5 Werner saw the generation of a thought, for example, not as a jigsaw-like process of assembling word-meanings according to syntactic rules (the dominant cognitivist image at the time), but as a process of rapid evolution from a subcortical glimmer of meaning into an elaborated complex of sensory and motor activations across the brain as a whole, and thence back again to the muscles and the viscera of the body.6

**Note:** Is a thought the same as coknsciousness?


To capture the experiential side of microgenesis more fully, I will make use of the other metaphor, welling up; as, for example, when we well up with emotion. Actually, welling up is a deeply embodied metaphor; many of our experiences of the body have this developmental quality. A sneeze and an orgasm are capable of being noticed as they gather muscular strength and patterning. But so do a bubble of laughter (that we may struggle to contain) and the feeling of being moved to tears. Some of our more psychologically tinged experiences also display at least aspects of their unfurling in consciousness. They start, if we are being attentive, vague, hazy and slight, and grow in shape, definition and urgency.


The broad structure of these fronds of communication is determined by the genetic programmes that shape our bodies. The actual expression of these genetic guidelines, though, is powerfully modulated by the accidents of our experience. So the fine details of how an embryonic intention unfurls are heavily experience-dependent. Synaptic connections are changed and chemical responses throughout the body altered by learning, so the pathways along which meanings unfold are individual and variable. At the risk of creating metaphorical overload: a gathering tide of activation flooding through the body is shaped by the channels and contours that thousands of previous tides have sculpted and left behind.


We might call these the four major fronds of the developing ‘fern’ of experience. One branch elaborates internal, ‘interoceptive’ body states: visceral, hormonal, immunological and neural. A second alters the direction and acuity of incoming sensation, via modulation of the ‘exteroceptive’ perceptual systems. A third branch begins to ready muscle groups for direct action. And the fourth branch may head in the direction of linguistic and other kinds of symbolic output such as gestures. And, as the fronds of the fern remain connected at the heart of the plant, so all of these remain functionally looped together in the body-brain.


The horticultural term espalier refers to the process of training a plant – often a fruit tree – into a particular shape as it grows, through selectively pruning offshoots and tying other shoots to a frame that directs their growth. Language acts as a kind of espalier for the meanings that are germinating within the body-mind.


Over time, as a child learns to use the dummy word ‘I’ correctly and fluently – not just ‘I fell’ or ‘I ate’, but the more puzzling ‘I saw’, ‘I tried’, ‘I decided’ and so on – it comes to seem that ‘I’ does indeed betoken some kind of ever-present ghostly observer, instigator, manager, editor or narrator lurking behind appearances. We get used to adding this ghostly espalier to each meaning as it unfurls. Eventually it appears self-evident to us that there is a (real, albeit spectral) observer who is capable of watching thoughts and experiences as they appear in and disappear from consciousness, and a real inner agent who does all the intelligent thinking and deciding.


The Chief Executive of the mind, so central to the Cartesian view, turns out to be a linguistic convention rather than a potent force. The actual business of thinking is embedded in the process of unfurling; it is a function of the whole dynamic body-brain system, not of any mysterious Fat Controller of the mind. But ‘I’ is not only redundant (as an internal agent); it also has the ability to make trouble. In daily life, the assumption that ‘I’ refers to a real inner entity can make self-critical judgements feel both more serious and more ‘sticky’. For example, in a linguistic construction, such as ‘I tried but failed’, there is apparently some thing (or some one) to which the judgement can adhere, and which is therefore obliged to feel culpable for the ‘failure’.


However, overlaid on these different time-scales there may be habits of attention that make us more or less sensitive to the unfolding dynamics within. We may develop a generalised habit of not paying attention to the early stages of the unfurling so that, whatever its intrinsic time-course, we do not become consciously aware of what is welling up until late in its development. We come habitually to notice aspects of experience that are already well formed and elaborated, but do not notice their hazier precursors. Thus, instead of noticing the gradual clarification and differentiation of a thought or a feeling, we experience our own experience in terms of a step-wise distinction between things that are not conscious and those that are. They appear to ‘pop into’ our minds – or even, in a magnificent sleight of hand, to spring, fully formed, out of the mouth of the ‘inner I’.


Language can certainly exacerbate this problem. There are many studies showing how a verbal label often leads to a kind of ‘functional fixedness’ in which alternative ways of looking at or categorising an object are rendered invisible by the label.


Being able to access and tolerate what some researchers refer to as ‘low ego-control’ or ‘low arousal’ mental states – those that are uncertain, provisional, ambiguous or vague – is demonstrably conducive to creative insight.


We can allow the ‘stream of consciousness’ to flow, or we can monitor and edit more carefully.


As I have said, none of this unfurling is originally or necessarily conscious. Often the major frond involves only unreflective action. But, in the course of their welling up, different kinds of somatic events and patterns may be produced that do cause a conscious experience to occur. Such experiences come in a variety of forms. One is the perceptual world of sights, sounds and so on, which we interpret as a 360-degree wraparound backdrop to all our actions. Then there are more or less clear bodily sensations, feelings, emotions and moods. There are expectations, premonitions and intentions: feelings of readiness or anticipation; the feeling that we know something before we can recall it. There is a whole range of inklings, hunches, promptings and other kinds of intuition. There are verbal or symbolic thoughts, as well as internal sensory and muscular images. And there are ‘memories’ (images that come tagged as recollections of past events) and ‘fantasies’ (images that come tagged as possible or probable future events).


Consciousness varies not just in contents but in its quality. If what is welling up starts to turn into a conscious welling up, it can do so not only in varying forms but with varying degrees of clarity and intensity. Sometimes there might only be glimmerings of awareness: the haziest and faintest of apprehensions. Sometimes we are not even sure if we are feeling anything. Sometimes we know that we are feeling something, but can’t yet pin it down. Sometimes these inner works-in-progress unfurl further, so that what was hazy begins to take a clearer, more differentiated form. Yet sometimes insights, emotions or thoughts burst into consciousness with the utmost force, precision and/or certainty. And as I discussed earlier, these stages of unfurling can be further muddied by our own habits of attention. Some people can tune into the faintest signals from their bodies; others don’t seem able to feel it even when they are, to anyone else, visibly fearful or angry.


The different ways in which the body’s neurochemical activity may eventuate in conscious awareness are under intensive investigation, but the question I want to focus on now is a more general one: when does any of this dark and silent internal activity, whatever its eventual form, become associated with consciousness? It is widely agreed in neuroscience that conscious awareness – whatever it is and whatever it is for – emerges alongside complex neurochemical states of biological organisms like us.


No one yet knows exactly what characterises those particular states, nor exactly which bits of the body-brain are crucial for consciousness. We can be sure, however, that they are complicated, integrated and distributed. There are strong suspicions that they involve regions of the brain like the anterior insula, the anterior cingulate, and areas of the prefrontal cortex, where all the various neurochemical loops come together and talk to each other; but other, more widely distributed, circuitry is almost certainly involved as well.


However, fools rush in, so I shall take a chance and say that, to give a rough approximation, consciousness seems to emerge when some combination of five conditions are present. The first is intensity. Consciousness accompanies external events that are sufficiently abrupt or intense:


The second is persistence. Intensity seems to interact with the persistence of a stimulus: less intense stimuli often become conscious if they persist for more than around half a second.


The third condition is reverberation. Persistence may occur not because of the physical continuation of an external event but because of conditions within the brain that allow activation to reverberate, for example round a well-worn neural circuit where resistance is low and activation can, so to speak, keep rekindling itself.


The fourth condition for consciousness is significance. Consciousness seems to be attracted by experiences that are of personal significance. These may be threats to physical well-being or survival, or to possessions or personal attributes with which one identifies.


Researchers such as Antonio Damasio, and Gerald Edelman and Giulio Tononi, have suggested that self-related events attract consciousness because they connect with a constantly active representation of the ‘core self’ in the brain, and thus become part of a massively reverberatory circuit. This isn’t a fixed, structural circuit; it functionally connects whatever aspects of internal neurochemical activity happen to be locked into the ‘core self’ at that moment.


And the fifth and final condition that is likely to bring about consciousness is checking. Activity often generates conscious experience when it is being internally checked or inhibited.


The sense of the inner author, instigator or observer is just another frond of the unfurling fern. Both ‘I’ and ‘thought’ emerge, in the moment, as aspects of the same upwelling experience.26 Whatever ideas or experiences come into consciousness, they are, as Shanon says, products of this intricate unfurling, not a direct inspection of it.


The sense of being able to inspect ourselves is ‘real’: as real as anything else that wells up and takes transiently conscious form. But the idea that this sense refers to a real ability to lift up the hood and look inside ourselves – that’s just another idea, and not an accurate one. It’s a unicorn.27


To quote just one example, from a recent paper: ‘Even though intuitive processes themselves remain unconscious, they produce outcomes such as intuitions or gut feelings that we can consciously attend to … and use in our judgements.’28 Familiar enough, and seemingly innocuous – yet who or what is this ‘we’ that is attending, being informed and making judgements? Both everyday and academic talk constantly smuggle in the idea of the ghostly agent – the mind – that is clearly other than the workings of the body-brain itself. The idea that thinking, and the feeling that there is an inner someone who is ‘doing’ the thinking, co-arise when the body-brain finds itself in certain kinds of state is hard to keep hold of, especially once we start talking!


This view of the self also fits with a wealth of research that shows, as the University of Virginia’s Timothy Wilson puts it, that we are ‘strangers to ourselves’.29


The research shows that we confabulate reasons for our behaviour all the time, and then treat them as if they were direct readouts from the interior – but they are often wrong.


It turns out that this inferred self-knowledge isn’t very good. Other people who know you reasonably well will predict your behaviour better than you will.


Your self does not end where your flesh ends, but suffuses and blends with the world, including other beings. Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee


The envelope of our skin (and all the specialised kinds of touch-receptors we have evolved, like eyes and ears) is not a boundary or a barrier but the place where we are joined to the world.


We saw that the healthy heart is in constant resonance with all its fellow organs and substances – and we human beings, through our bodies, are in continual resonance with the flux of energy, activity and information that surrounds and batters us.


That is because there is, around your solid body, an invisible bubble which scientists call the ‘peripersonal space’. It is the area in which, without shifting your overall position in space, you could grab, stroke, kick or butt something if it came your way.2 It is the zone of direct interaction with the physical world: the principal arena in which we use our limbs to latch on to things we desire or that interest us, or to fight off or bat away things that are noxious or threatening


It has to be close – in the monkey’s case, around eight inches away – before the effect begins, and the cells’ responses get stronger as the stimulus approaches closer and closer. The effective body extends out beyond the solid pillar of meat that we usually call ‘the body’.


Graziano and Gross also found that many of these cells are not where the traditional view would have them be: tucked away towards the back of the brain in the parietal cortex, where information from the senses is known to come together and combine into multisensory representations. No, some of these cells were up front, in the premotor cortex. Here we have another clear example of the interwoven, sensorimotor view of the brain we looked at in Chapter 4. The whole point of being able to predict that something is about to brush your hand is to be able to adjust your hand to grasp it, avoid it or just let it arrive (depending on what you are up to, and what you think it is). The brain is designed to let perceptual predictions and action readiness resonate together virtually instantaneously, and it is smart of it to do so.


A striking demonstration of the different ways the brain treats the peripersonal zone and the space beyond has been reported by Italian neurologist Anna Berti. One of her patients had a brain disorder that made her seem oblivious to the left side of her vision – but only for things that were within reaching distance. When she was asked to point to the middle of a horizontal stick close to her, she pointed way off to the right-hand end. But when the stick was moved further away, and she was asked to indicate the middle using a laser pointer, she got it more or less right.5 In everyday language we mark this shift by talking about ‘this book’ (within grasping distance) as opposed to ‘that book’ (further away). It would sound odd in English to say, ‘I’m sorry to trouble you, but could you possibly pass me this book.’

The functional zone around the body isn’t fixed, though: far from it. When it needs to, your brain is able to adjust the size and shape of this My-space depending on what you happen to be wearing, driving or using at the time. When we pay someone an old-fashioned compliment and say ‘That hat becomes you’, we are speaking the literal truth.

**Note:** Lil


Desirable objects towards the outer limit of the reachable space are seen as nearer than undesirable or unpleasant ones. That is to say, the peripersonal zone is bigger for things you are keen on.6


When people have been using a ‘grabber’ to pick up litter, they judge the distance between elbow and fingertips on the hand which had been using the tool as longer than on the other arm. We literally feel as if our own arm has been elongated.


The backbone of the story of human evolution has been the story of perfecting our knack for incorporating an increasingly sophisticated assortment of physical tools into our increasingly flexible body schemas. Sandra and Matthew Blakeslee11


The British engineer Francis Evans has suggested that our technological disposition developed out of two evolutionary shifts. The first was an inquisitive inclination to mess about with the material we find, and get it to reveal additional affordances. If you fiddle with a stick you might reveal its ability to become a fishing rod. If you try smashing stones of a certain kind together, you might splinter off shards that can be found useful for cutting. And the second big contributor to our technological bent was, of course, learning how to get up on our hind legs and free our hands for manipulation and investigation.


This is, if you will, another manifestation of our somatic nature – the deep disposition for us humans to weave together our sense of what we want to do, what we are capable of doing, and what the circumstances allow us to do.


Richard Dawkins in The Extended Phenotype makes a very good case that beaver+dam+pond work together so closely that the dam and the pond actually are parts of the extended body of the beaver.14


Though philosophers are haggling about the niceties, it seems perfectly reasonable to me to see this orchestration of thought and action, memory and writing, brain and paper as essentially Mind At Work. We routinely sidestep the shortcomings of our own on-board intelligence by intelligently co-opting bits of the world, and intelligently using them to amplify our capabilities. We are constantly on the lookout for the next mindware upgrade (as Andy Clark puts it) to come along.16


When people lose the capacity for inhibition through damage or disease of the frontal lobes, they become compulsive mimics of other people’s gestures and speech. In a disorder called echolalia, their imitation may even be triggered by their own speech or behaviour, locking them into long, debilitating loops of self-imitation.


So whether we are aware of it or not, our bodies are in a state of continual resonance with those around us – or those we may be remembering or imagining. While you and I think we are discussing the film we’ve just seen, our bodies are dancing with each other’s every gesture and expression. If we are sitting side by side in rocking chairs, and able to see each other, the rocking of our two chairs will synchronise, without our awareness or intention, even if one chair is weighted so that it requires more effort to rock it. In fact, as we were watching the movie, our brains quickly developed a point-by-point synchronisation. We were literally entrained.20


When we say (in a parody of the empathetic Californian) ‘I feel your pain’, we often mean we are resonating at the emotional level. But a recent British study shows that, when we are watching someone else in pain, many of us feel comparable sensations in our own bodies. In this study, people were shown either film clips or still photos of other people in pain, and about a third of them reported physical sensations – always in the appropriate part of the body. The intensity with which we react to the sight (and sound) of someone else in pain depends on how emotionally close we are to them. If you watch a nurse stick a needle into your own child, your involuntary reaction is (not surprisingly) much stronger than if it is someone else’s child. We resonate most strongly with those we care most about.23

In general, one of the effects of depression, in both children and adults, is to dampen this social resonance so that the sufferer actually feels physically isolated from others (and they from her).30


Because our concepts interweave perceptions, actions and concerns (or Needs, Deeds and See’ds, as I put it earlier), these models of familiar individuals enable us to predict not just what they will do, on certain occasions, but how they will see things, and how they will feel. So these models can underpin the child’s growing powers of empathy – having an increasingly good idea what it is like to be ‘you’ (and ‘you’ and ‘you’ and ‘you’), and thus to adopt different perspectives on events.


I would like to pick out one of these putative archetypes for special attention as it will be useful to us later. I call it the Benign Generalised Other: the image of a person who knows us deeply and judges us not at all. Sometimes this image derives from a grandparent, or from a counsellor, psychotherapist or priest. Sometimes it is embodied in a religious figure such as Christ or Buddha. Often it is a composite of several sources. Whatever its provenance, it has the benefit, if one can learn the trick of mentally ‘putting oneself in their shoes’, of providing a warm, neutral point of observation for our own and others’ behaviour. This attentive, accepting vantage point lies at the heart of what is fashionably called ‘mindfulness’ practice.


That it can be as much a central mark of intelligence to be able to improvise a useful or decorative artefact from available materials, as it is to be able to talk about the problem to others, has not generally been seen by philosophers to invite any special sort of enquiry. Andrew Harrison1


The amount and nature of the explicit knowledge you need is entirely dependent on the job; it is not a universal good.


There are many ways of thinking, and thinking with your mouth or your laptop are only two of them – albeit important ones. People think with their bodily feelings. They think with their mind’s eye. And they think with their hands, both through gesture and in the actual process of making things. It is not that the intellect conceives of things and then the hands do what they are told. The interaction of the two is (to revisit an earlier analogy) more like a dance in which sometimes one person leads and sometimes the other. The English artist Grayson Perry says, ‘Ideas come on the hoof, while I am working with material.’


Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein (from whose stimulating blog this story is taken) skewer the main point like this: Physical manipulation of things, like direct personal experience of any kind, generates sensory images of all sorts and thus enables thought. Hands-on tinkering leads to minds-on thinkering. Bodily engagement with nature teaches much more than any amount of words or numbers in science books. Doing produces a personal understanding that symbols simply can’t.8


Another influential philosopher, Michael Polanyi, famously called this tacit knowledge: knowledge that is such a fine web of contingent possibilities, built up through years of experience, that it simply cannot be rendered down into words.


This means we have to acknowledge and value ways of knowing that are not capable of being unfurled into language, because any language, like the symbols on a map, creates distinctions that are not actually present in the neurochemical territory of the body. All maps have to be crude (mis)representations, or they will not be useful for finding our way about.


Nevertheless, as with Ruth, the struggle to get closer to being able to articulate your tacit knowledge, while ultimately doomed, may be very productive. It makes you think, and it connects you with other sources of support and criticism. Any deep process of verbal creativity will, of necessity, involve an uncomfortable groping for phrases and images that try to do justice to something ‘real’ in the territory that cuts across the conventions of the map.


As e.e. cummings says in his ‘Poet’s Advice to Students’: Whenever you think, or you believe, or you know, you’re a lot of other people; but the moment you feel, you’re nobody-but-yourself … [And] as for expressing nobody-but-yourself in words, that means working just a little harder than anyone who isn’t a poet can possibly imagine…13


So let us have a quick look at how non-intellectual learning happens. There are, as we would expect, three components to expertise: having a good repertoire of reliable, flexible, skilful actions to call on; being perceptive about the opportunities for action and the affordances of the material you are working on; and hooking both of these up with a sense of what kinds of valued outcomes could arise from acting that way.


There is learning by noticing. Just by being attentive to the world, the neurochemical systems pick up patterns and regularities. The bodily systems automatically tune themselves to register what goes with what, and what follows what. Attention is itself a skilled and variegated capability.


Deserving of a category of its own is learning by imitating. Close observation of a role model serves as a template for one’s own tentative actions.


The Siamese twin of observing is learning by doing: perception is no use if it does not become a guide for skilled action.


But if all you aim for is automation, don’t be surprised if you turn out to be an automaton. Fluent expertise needs judgement, flexibility and creativity as well as reliability. So some practice time (and attention) needs to be earmarked for a more playful attitude: not just playing the ‘game’ (whether that be tennis, surgery or haute cuisine) as well as you can, but playing with it.


As Richard Sennett says, ‘Technique develops by a dialectic between the correct way to do something and the willingness to experiment through error. The two sides cannot be separated.’21


So, from the embodied point of view, before any training in logical analysis or ‘rational thinking’ must come a well-developed sensitivity to the processes of one’s own body. If, in the process of developing rationality, that sensibility has been lost or muted, intelligence itself is diminished and needs to be rehabilitated.


But the embodied point of view on consciousness, as I have developed it, is different. The entire human system is self-organising. There is no ‘little person in the head’ who does the cognitive heavy lifting: who ‘pays attention’, ‘makes decisions’ and ‘plans actions’. When aspects of our internal activity become linked to consciousness, this is often because they are currently bound in to the high-level ‘dynamic core’ where all the different loops of neurochemical activation come together. So the benefit of ‘being conscious’ of our gut feelings is simply that, when awareness does arise, the underlying pattern of somatic activity is playing its part in the ‘central committee’. Its information is being taken into account. The benefit of developing greater ‘interoceptive awareness’, therefore, is that more of our viscerally embodied feelings and values are ‘at the table’. If they are not accompanied by consciousness, it probably means that, though they may well be active, they are not currently engaged in contributing to that top-level democratic decision-making process.


But it is also possible that bodily awareness is reduced when signals in the ‘normal’ range are not being processed properly as they loop up into the brain, and especially into the areas where all our sources of sensory information come together: the cingulate, the insula and parts of the prefrontal cortex. As we have seen, the brain is perfectly capable of muting feelings that, for whatever reason, it has decided are threatening or inappropriate, so that information is inhibited or expurgated as it unfurls.


So what can we do – assuming the damage to our complex interior is not irreversible – to smarten up? In the rest of this chapter I will review four methods proven to be effective. The first is biofeedback: training ourselves to be more sensitive to and in control of our insides. The second is meditation, particularly a widely used form called mindfulness practice. The third is a therapeutic process called focusing, which increases awareness specifically of activity in the torso, where all our major organs live. This both increases interoceptive awareness directly and quietens competing forms of noisy activity in the mind. And the fourth is exercise and movement, some, but not all, of which helps to enhance intelligence. Actually there is a fifth form of somatic therapy as well – shifting our understanding of human intelligence so our minds make room for our bodies. That is the whole purpose of this book.


Some of the same benefits can be achieved without the use of biofeedback machines, simply by training yourself to attend more fully and with greater stability to bodily sensations. Attention is like a muscle that becomes stronger and more controllable over time; apparently it can be developed just like any other habit. One of the most well-known ways of developing this attentional control is through a kind of meditation practice called mindfulness training. In this training, you sit still and quietly, gently attempting to keep your attention focused on a simple bodily sensation such as the rise and fall of your chest and abdomen as you breathe naturally. Despite all the familiar background chatter and distractions of the so-called ‘discursive mind’, it is possible, with patience and persistence, for that interoceptive awareness to become clearer and more stable, and it can come to function as a kind of anchor that keeps your awareness more strongly focused in the present and reduces the length of time you spend ruminating over past and future.


Studies of mindfulness practitioners have shown how this shift in attentional habits is mirrored in the functioning of the brain. Norman Farb and his colleagues at the University of Toronto have identified two complementary networks in the brain’s frontal lobes. One involves pathways in the medial prefrontal cortex and the language centres, and this network keeps tabs on our overall portfolio of personal projects, interests and disappointments. The other involves the lateral prefrontal cortex, the insula and the anterior cingulate, and focuses on what is going on in the present moment both within and outside the body. Seasoned meditators show less activity in the medial system and more in the lateral. They have upped their ‘presence of mind’ and reduced the time spent anxiously planning, reviewing and rewriting the scripts for achieving their goals and righting the wrongs they (think they) have suffered.11


So this increased ability to be fully present to all the information, including our own core values (which for most of us includes altruism or ‘being a good person’), means that it is not just intelligence in an abstract sense that benefits; our wider social and personal well-being increases too. A patient who had spent some time in a form of body-oriented psychotherapy, learning to pay closer attention to her bodily sensations and reactions, sums up this subtle step-change in full, real-world intelligence very clearly. The training, she said, has done a lot to help me be calm when I’m in a stressful situation. So that when the stress arises – when you get to the airport and your plane is delayed nine hours and there’s no flights and no hotels and everyone else is sort of screaming – I don’t join in that any more. Now I can just see, ‘Oh, I’m feeling a bit agitated … time to start breathing!’ And realising that you have the ability to respond rather than react and the degree to which all of us are on automatic pilot most of the time. It’s like, ‘No, you have options here; you can choose how to respond to this situation.’


Bodily awareness is made up of all kinds of sensations – and people may be sensitive to one kind and not to another. Meditators, as we saw, have been found to be more sensitive than average to touch on their skin, but no better than average at judging their heart rate when they are in a very quiet and relaxed state. Athletes and dancers can become very attuned to the feeling of their muscular bodies, but not to their emotional bodies (a dissonance very effectively dramatised by Natalie Portman in the film Black Swan). Developing interoception is a many-sided job, and different kinds of training may be needed to develop different areas.


Sensitivity to what is going on in the major cavities of the body – the throat, the chest and the abdomen – is one of the most important areas when it comes to developing ‘intelligence in the flesh’. And here it is worth mentioning a specific practice called ‘focusing’ that has been developed to train exactly this aspect of our bodily awareness. Back in the 1960s, Eugene Gendlin and his colleagues at the University of Chicago were trying to identify the ‘magic ingredient’ in counselling and psychotherapy that made some clients feel they were making productive progress, while others were spinning their wheels. After analysing hundreds of tape recordings of therapeutic sessions, they found it. It wasn’t the school of the psychotherapist, or even their personality or ‘bedside manner’. What made the difference, in the majority of cases, was whether clients spontaneously talked about their troubles in a particular way.17 The stuck clients (to put it very crudely) tended to trot out tales of woe fluently and rapidly. They had their well-rehearsed story – and they were sticking to it. But, strikingly, the ones who were getting the most benefit talked much more hesitantly. It was as if they were trying to find just the right words to express the complex truth of their predicament, and were listening carefully to their own formulations to see if they did justice to this truth. Moreover, it turned out that the touchstone of this truth was not a cognitive response but a visceral one. Clients were not rationally appraising what they had said, but allowing their spoken words to resonate with what they were feeling in their bodies, especially in the torso, where the major organs and the visceral core are situated.


Gendlin called this pre-verbal, embodied sensation the ‘felt sense’. The successful clients were in touch with this felt sense and were checking to make sure that the essential meanings were preserved as it unfurled into words. When they were, Gendlin discovered, clients experienced a bodily feeling of relaxation – ‘Ah yes, that’s it. That’s exactly it.’ The felt sense would then change, and deeper understanding, integration or reconciliation would emerge. In a picturesque image, Gendlin once described this process as like ‘listening to the child in your chest’. When the child feels accurately heard and appreciated, it can, so to speak, stop squirming and grizzling, and unwind. It feels as if an uncomfortable blockage, like indigestion, has been dissolved, releasing a fuller, more integrated feeling of inner flow and harmony.


In a telephone seminar in 2011, Gendlin explained why. Focusing is a way to access your bodily knowing. Your body picks up more of the other person than you consciously can. Your body also puts out more of yourself than you intend or than you know is visible. Others often react to that rather than to your conscious message. With a little training you can get a feel for your bodily knowing of what is going on.19


For example, Gendlin has more recently discovered that the same kind of patient inward attention contributes significantly to the process of creative thinking. Gendlin has developed a kind of coaching protocol in which one person can help another to take the inkling of a novel idea, which they do not initially know how to express very well, and slow down its unfurling so that a genuinely satisfying expression of this idea can gradually evolve and come together. He has dubbed this ‘Thinking at the edge’ (or TATE, for short). Like therapeutic focusing, the process starts with a general question: ‘In your professional field, or in your life, what do you “know” and cannot yet say, that wants to be said?’ Your partner then helps to guide your sensing and thinking with a kind of subtle, patient midwifery, until you begin to find new forms of words (or other symbols), the mots justes, that ‘do justice’ to the original inkling. Though this research is still in its infancy, there are several encouraging studies of the use of TATE in various managerial, academic and educational contexts.

The third benefit comes from exercise that increases our interoceptive awareness (and not all exercise has that intent or that effect). T’ai chi is a prime example of exercise where bodily awareness is explicitly cultivated. It is a venerable, originally Chinese, exercise regime that consists of slow, flowing bodily movements requiring detailed coordination of head, eyes, arms, torso, pelvis and legs. The movements are very precise but, to begin with, quite unfamiliar and so require a high degree of concentration and subtle body awareness to master. In a review of well-conducted evaluations of the cumulative effects of t’ai chi, Peter Wayne (US Scientist of the Year 2013) and his colleagues at the Harvard Medical School found significant increases in bodily awareness, with clear benefits for both mental and physical functioning. Elderly practitioners of t’ai chi are less likely to fall (and suffer the consequences of bruising and bone fracture that can follow), for example, because they feel the sensations of their feet on the ground more fully and accurately. Ironically, because they are more present, and less preoccupied (as many elderly people are) with a fear of falling, they fall less often. And the functioning of their internal systems improves more generally, so that there are real benefits to memory and problem-solving as well. These benefits are significantly larger than any that accrue from forms of physical exercise that do not focus on the cultivation of bodily awareness.26


you a ‘quick win’.27 Dance training, too, requires the dancer to develop


Dance training, too, requires the dancer to develop a high degree of bodily awareness – though the emphasis may be more on the muscles, and the positioning and shaping of the body in space, than on the more visceral aspects of interoception. So we might expect a mixed picture when we go looking for cognitive benefits of dance. Some of the yoga studies, for example, used a dance class as a control group, and found little cognitive benefit of dance as compared with Hatha yoga. Peter Lovatt, however, has found a direct effect of dance on the way people think. Peter is both a professional dancer and an academic psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire. With his colleague Carine Lewis, Peter gave novice dancers 15 minutes of either free, improvisational dance, or of highly structured dance steps, and then tested them on their ability to solve two different kinds of puzzle. One required creative insightful thinking, the other more logical and analytical thinking. The effect of the dancing on their problem-solving was quite specific. The improvisational dancers showed improved performance on the insight problems but not on the analytical problems, while the structured dancers showed exactly the reverse effect.

Gone is the central executive in the brain – the boss who organises and integrates the activities of multiple special-purpose sub-systems. And gone is the neat boundary between the thinker (the bodiless intellectual engine) and the thinker’s world. In place of this comforting image we confront a vision of mind … not limited by the tenuous envelope of skin and skull. Andy Clark1


Even to speak of ‘having a body’, or of something occurring in or to ‘my body’, is to misrepresent the situation; it is to insert the thinnest but most insidious of wedges between the body and a hypothetical owner or driver. Even to write – as I was just tempted to – of ‘the world around me’ or ‘my environment’ is to presume that Me and the World I Inhabit are separate, or at least separable, and this is simply incorrect. That’s what the science of embodiment tells us.


However deeply embedded these dualistic habits are in our language and thought, they are crude and often misleading approximations to our real nature. Our common sense about ourselves is not innocent or transparent. Identifying with the image we see in the Cartesian mirror has consequences, and not all of them are good, or even neutral.


Sometimes these fronds of consciousness co-occur, and then I have the impression of a self thinking, or planning an action, or rehearsing a move, as if one frond were the cause or controller of another. But really, the ‘I’ is as much an upwelling from the interior as the thought or the action itself. I am a body–mind–context constellation, ever changing and ever welling up. And so, I think, are you.


But really, the ‘I’ is as much an upwelling from the interior


If I see myself as a ghostly mind, it is easy to feel that I am an isolated and self-contained individual: a localised bubble of consciousness. But if I am a body, first and foremost, then I am already deeply connected. Once I really get that mind is the conscious accomplice of the body, not its governor, I can’t avoid seeing myself as an aspect of the wider body social and body politic.3 As cells are to the physical body, so people are to the larger ‘corporations’ to which they belong. Embodied implies embedded.


Visceral processes (as we saw in Chapter 6) can be dampened, through the use of muscular tension, and disconnected neurochemically from the central somatic processes that bind together feeling, action and perception.


As Matthew Crawford, author of The Case for Working with Your Hands, says, ‘it is a peculiar sort of idealism that insistently steers people towards the most ghostly kinds of work’.


It is harder to connect with and be influenced by other people’s distress if you have become cumulatively desensitised, and also if you cannot see the immediate hurt in their posture or hear the tremor in their voice. One of the authors of the study, Edward O’Brien, puts it like this. ‘The casual relationship people have with their online “friends” makes it easy to just tune out when users don’t feel like dealing with others’ problems and emotions.


It could also be that our hand-held devices encourage a disposition towards fast reaction, and thus limit our bodily involvement. Antonio Damasio has found that our higher emotions such as empathy or compassion require biological processes that are inherently slow. It takes seconds, not milliseconds, for such feelings to germinate and unfurl within us. So chronic speediness could be reducing our emotional register in damaging ways.13


The current obsession with digital technology raises a number of such concerns, and they are coming at us so thick and fast that research cannot document which are real problems and which are new forms of perennial moans about the decline of the young. Screen life is sedentary. Yes, you can do physical exercise or play virtual golf with your Wii, but the vast majority of screen life requires fingertips and eye muscles only. The body’s massive musculature is trivially engaged. Does that matter? Screen life is sensorily impoverished. It offers sight and sound, but – with the exception of the tapping of keys (and the Hug Shirt) – nothing solid and smelly, tickly and tasty in the way that real life is. Computers lead us to concentrate more and more on the two evolutionarily younger senses, sight and hearing, and to withdraw attention from the others.


More broadly, the Maker Movement is rampant in many countries of the world, providing free access to both traditional and digital workshops (called Hackerspaces or FabLabs) for people who want to make anything from a bird-box to a dancing robot. FabLabs are available in cities across the planet from Lafayette to Milan to Shanghai. Makers are also putting pressure on manufacturers to make things that are easier to repair. Mister Jalopy, the pseudonym of a maker guru in Los Angeles, has developed a ‘Maker’s Bill of Rights’ (the full manifesto can be found at www.makezine.com). It includes: Meaningful and specific parts lists shall be included with everything • If it snaps shut, it shall snap open Special tools are allowed only for darn good reasons Individual components, not entire sub-assemblies, shall be replaceable Ease of repair shall be a design ideal, not an afterthought


Gever Tulley’s ‘Tinkering School’ is a summer camp in the US. He guarantees to anxious parents that they have no need to worry: their child will come home covered in bruises and scratches. His much-watched TED talk is called ‘Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Child Do’. They include playing with fire, owning and using a penknife, and making and throwing spears.


Sociologist Richard Sennett has studied the changing fortunes of a bakery in Boston. Back in the 1970s the work was hard, you had to get up early, people got burnt, but there was a sense of communal pride in a delicious, beautiful batch of focaccia. There was craft: the flour varied in texture, so an experienced baker, feeling the flour in his hands, would make an adjustment to the amount of oil added or to the baking time. By the late 1990s, there were a lot of part-time workers who hardly knew each other, and computer-controlled machines that just had to be fed bags of ‘croissant mix’ when the appropriate icon blinked. The environment is safer now, but it is craftsman-hostile, because human craft is neither needed nor possible, and so no pride ensues. All the intelligence has been appropriated by a machine. But if the machine breaks down, there is hardly anyone left who actually knows how to make bread. One old Italian man said to Sennett: ‘I go home, I really bake bread: I’m a baker. Here? I just push buttons.’ As Sennett’s work powerfully attests, this loss of pride in craft knowledge, and of a satisfying sense of belonging to a skilled community, is a personal tragedy, but it is also, writ large, a social, even a global issue.


Matthew Crawford, in The Case for Working with Your Hands, nails this point. ‘The trades suffer from low prestige, and I believe this is based on a simple mistake. Because the work is dirty, many people assume it is also stupid.’


If you want to teach a computer to play chess, or if you want to design a search engine, the old model is OK. But if you’re interested in understanding real intelligence, you have to deal with the body. Rolf Pfeifer22


As a starting point for the development of a science of embodied intelligence, let me offer this. Intelligence is getting things done that matter to you. It is finding good resolutions of those three sets of factors: your concerns, your capabilities and your circumstances. And to do that well, you need your body, and you need the kind of broad, detailed integration of its messages that gives rise to conscious awareness.


Laszlo Bock, the senior vice-president in charge of ‘people operations’ – the head of HR – says: ‘For every job the No. 1 thing we look for is general cognitive ability, and it’s not I.Q. It’s learning agility. It’s the ability to process on the fly.’ Behind the ability to learn quickly lies what Bock calls ‘intellectual humility’. You have to be able to give up the knowledge and expertise you thought would see you through, and look with fresh eyes. People with a high IQ often have a hard time doing that. They are certainly no better than average at tolerating uncertainty, or being able to adopt fresh perspectives.26


Intelligence is the orchestrating and conducting of a whole ensemble of influences which include, essentially, those of the body; and, through the body, those of the external world.


My claim is more radical than that. It is that practical, embodied intelligence is the deepest, oldest, most fundamental and most important of the lot; and the others are facets or outgrowths of this basic somatic capability. Emotional intelligence is an aspect of bodily intelligence. Mathematical intelligence is a development of bodily intelligence. To identify ‘bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence’ just with what top gymnasts and artisans have is to miss the fact that, at a deeper level, this one intelligence is in fact the root system on which all the others depend.


To deal well with life’s demands requires a full body – not just for getting around and implementing actions, but because a well-integrated, well-tuned, highly resonant body is itself the organ of intelligence.


But without all those loops carrying fast-changing information about what is possible and what is desirable, and without the constant conversation between all the far-flung outposts of the body, the brain would not be intelligent at all. It is only as good as the intelligence it receives. The condition of my body, and of my awareness of its humming, shimmering activity, constantly modulates my ability to be smart.


And through the body, we are deeply connected with and constituted by the world around us. The tools and resources we use literally become incorporated into the body’s working definition of itself. Our bodies actually vibrate with each other so that individual Mes begin to dissolve into a larger resonant system called Us. Embodied cognition teaches us to notice that we are much more ecological and social than the Cartesian doctrine has led us to believe.
