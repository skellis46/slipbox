# Blanco Borelli and moore - TikTok, Friendship, and Sipping Tea, or How to Endure a Pandemic

> These types of brief performances are intended for the phone screen, with artificial intelligence driving the app’s capabilities to loop, distort, and alter images and video. For performance studies scholars, TikTok evinces what Elise Morrison, Tavia Nyong’o, and Joseph Roach move us to think of as the “algorithmic performative,” noting that “it has become increasingly difficult in this day and age to use the term “performance” without calling up an algorithmic matrix of input/output, cause and effect.”2 In similar fashion, we also see TikTok enacting what Sianne Ngai would call a “capitalist gimmick.”3 This gimmick “is both a wonder and a trick. It is a form we marvel at and distrust, admire and disdain, whose affective intensity for us increases precisely because of this ambivalence.”4 These critical frames could not be more relevant in 2020 and beyond.[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.298]

> When articulating the performance cultures of a social media app like TikTok, an app that relies on the endless circulation of relatable content, performance scholars might take up Simone Brown’s question: “how do we understand the body once it is made into data?”7 In this, examining TikTok through a critical dance and performance studies lens offers a multiplicity of ways to see how the body-as-data is mobilized through gesture, dance, fashion, speech acts, and choreography. With its rise in popularity during the pandemic, in addition to the machinations by the Trump Administration to ban TikTok in the United States, TikTok exists as a rich, neoliberally activated virtual stage that moves across pleasure, politics, and personality.8[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.299]

> I think what I find so compelling about TikTok is that it extends what John Muse calls “microdramas,” or incredibly brief performances that challenge temporal structure.9 Muse points out that there is a long history of really brief performance, and I think TikTok videos are a great example of that because they can only be a minute long, not more. That temporal limit presents an incredibly tight but exciting range of performance possibilities. -- madison moore [@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.299]

> TikTok also functions as a digital commons, a space where “difference” seems obsolete because in order to belong, you just have to join TikTok, know the parameters of how to make a video and then use it according to your own skills and aesthetic preferences. This digital commons of TikTok offers up a creative, collaborative, and even critical space to comment on the current moment. Harmony Bench asks several questions in her book Perpetual Motion that feel relevant here to our discussion: “What can dance, movement, and gesture afford—and what conflicts arise—when they are perceived as common or utilized to enact a common? How, why, and for whom are assertions of dance as common meaningful in digital contexts?”11 -- Melissa Blanco Borelli[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.300]

> So, while TikTok’s accessibility and usability set it up as a commons, I think you are right in bringing up the algorithm (and the algorithms of race) that lie beneath its seemingly universal veneer. Bench writes about a participatory commons as “as an alternative to the extractive neoliberal financial logics that govern much of contemporary life in the United States and beyond.”12 Yet, TikTok is most definitely a product of neoliberalism’s marketing and commodification of the self through social media. The tension between TikTok functioning as a participatory commons outside of neoliberal financial logics while simultaneously being a product of the neoliberal financialization of the self makes it the perfect stage for critical dance and performance analysis. Such critical framing helps me to unpack and justify my pleasure in TikTok. -- Melissa Blanco Borelli [@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.300]

> It’s a question of both/and here, and I think the contradictory nature of TikTok as a space of possibility and a space where folks can do hot takes on popular [p.300] culture and a space deeply tied to flows of capital is what makes it such an interesting venue to think about contemporary performance onscreen. We can agree that TikTok absolutely is a product of the neoliberal financialization of the self. Part of the allure of the app is the way it creates the kind of participatory commons through shared performance content. -- madison moore [@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok pp.300-301]

> But even as I embrace the potential for worldmaking on the app, I am also aware and wary of the ways TikTok is programmed solely to capitalize on my attention. I’m thinking of Shaka McGlotten here, who writes so beautifully about the ways technology, data, and algorithms impact our daily lives. McGlotten is interested in how these systems “hack our desires in increasingly molecular ways,” encouraging us to keep “our eyes glued to screens and our bodies arranged around our phones or otherwise contorted, our fingers tapping, typing, swiping, and scrolling away.”13 The fact that I stopped watching TV in favor of TikTok is a prime example of the power of my catered TikTok algorithm, which computer scientist Tristan Harris notes is designed to do exactly this. “If you want to maximize addictiveness,” he wrote in an article that appeared in the Observer, “all tech designers need to do is link a user’s action (like pulling a lever) with a variable reward.”14 It’s the roulette wheel or slot machine effect that, when programmed correctly, wins no matter what you choose. -- madison moore[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.301]

> Again, here I am thinking of what Ngai writes about the gimmick: “Labor, time, value: the contradictions that explain why the gimmick simultaneously annoys and attracts us explain why it permeates virtually every aspect of capitalist life.”16 If each TikTok video can be interpreted as a gimmick, how do these videos corporealize labor, time, and value so that we can see the process of performance and self-making through performance? -- Melissa Blanco Borelli[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.302] 


> The house wins. As Ruha Benjamin warns, illusions of progress that we might assume because we see more marginalized people on screen allows “racist habits and logics to enter through the backdoor of tech design, in which the humans who create the algorithms are hidden from view.”19 -- madison moore[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.303]

> But, it does seem that videos that remain within the white standards of TikTok form and content aesthetics that get the most followers. -- Melissa Blanco Borelli[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.305]

— but surely most followers will depend on most users? This needs to be expressed as a percentage of total users (and by geography, etc). Otherwise we are just making things up based on perception.


> One magical day, I logged onto TikTok and felt its algorithm FINALLY understood what I wanted to see: a mixture of Black and Brown queer, femme and camp performance peppered with make-up tutorials, clever dance choreographies, and Schitt’s Creek, The Crown or Golden Girls parodies. -- Melissa Blanco Borelli[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.305]

> It reminds me of what Diana Taylor writes about performance, that, “performance— as reiterated corporeal behaviors—functions within a system of codes and conventions in which behaviors are reiterated, re-acted, reinvented, or relived. Performance is a constant state of again-ness.”22 -- Melissa Blanco Borelli[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.305]

> The same forms of aesthetic excess that lead to Black and Latinx being called “unprofessional” or “ugly” make Black gay men millionaires and billionaires, in the case of Tyler Perry. Case in point: @nasfromthegram has 1.3 million followers. MILLION. Who is his audience? Videos like these make me think about Safiya Noble’s notion of “technological redlining,” which is the power algorithms have to swiftly create, normalize, and reinforce stereotypes.27 -- madison moore[@blancoborelli-2021-tiktok p.309]
