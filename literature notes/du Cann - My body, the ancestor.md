# du Cann - my body, the ancestor

_previous note:_ [[your body is an ancestor]]

- interview with Sophie Strand


> I wanted to talk with Sophie because she speaks of opening out and connecting in a culture of closing down and control, of merging with others in a time of individualism and constriction. In a series of luminous short essays she writes of a practice of ‘deep life’ whereby we can ‘stitch ourselves back’ into our local territories and feel and think as ecosystems. p.75

- weathering collapse, collapse as generative pp.75-77

> So for me it's become a frame: how can we wed our personal wounds with the wounds of something more-than-human? How we look at our physical ailments, our psychological anguish not as something that teaches us about ourselves but that reorients us to something else outward. – Sophie Strand, interview with Charlotte du Cann, p77 Dark Mountain V21 (2022)

- held by home (and constituted metabolically by home), p.78
- resilient ecosystems, adrienne maree brown and inch-wide mile-deep movement, p.78
- Bachelard and poetry as means to get closest to truth, p.78
- making good soil for others, not as an "individual charismatic author", p.80
