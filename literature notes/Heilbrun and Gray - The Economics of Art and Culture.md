# Heilbrun and Gray - The Economics of Art and Culture

> The dominant tradition among Western economists holds that given the existing distribution of income, competitive markets in most circumstances can be relied on to satisfy consumer preferences optimally. According to this view there are two principal grounds for justifying government subsidies or other forms of intervention.[@heilbrun-2001-economics p.219]

> The first would be that markets are not competitive or display other imperfections. These are the efficiency arguments, so called because some form of “market failure” has led to an inefficient allocation of resources, which it is the task of intervention to correct. Moreover, economists are in substantial agreement about which imperfections justify what sorts of government intervention. Debate therefore focuses not on the theoretical arguments for intervention, but on whether the art and culture industries, in fact, operate under the justifying conditions.[@heilbrun-2001-economics p.219]

> The second justification for intervention would be a belief that the existing distribution of income is unsatisfactory. We say “belief” to emphasize the fact that judgments about the distribution of income cannot be scientific, but are necessarily based on ethical conviction. This is the so-called equity argument: Subsidies are called for not because markets are working inefficiently, but because it is alleged [p.220] that some participants lack the income to buy a minimum fair share.[@heilbrun-2001-economics pp.219-220]

> But after such individual pleasures are accounted for, however rich and exciting they may be, is there anything additional that should be classified as an external or collective benefit? The question is controversial; no aspect of the economics of art has been debated at greater length, which in itself suggests that the answer is not unambiguous. Perhaps that is inevitable, for it is in the nature of the case that the external benefits of art and culture are likely to be diffuse and unobservable.[@heilbrun-2001-economics p.226]

Potential collective benefits:
1. Legacy to future generations.
2. National identity and prestige.
3. Benefits to the local economy.
4. Contribution to a liberal education.
5. Social improvement of arts participants.

> Moreover, the claim that art improves the citizen or elevates the soul smacks so much of snobbism that it is likely to be counterproductive in building public support for the arts, and it risks seeming to diminish art’s principal function for the individual, which is to provide aesthetic pleasure.[@heilbrun-2001-economics p.229]

6. Encouraging artistic innovation.

> Artistic experiment is costly and subject to failure. Whenit fails, the artist or not-for-profit organization who made the attemptmust bear the full cost (and without the tax offsets available in busi-ness situations). But when it succeeds, the innovators cannot preventothers from using the new technique free of charge. Consequently,the scales are loaded against artistic innovators, and they probablyundertake less experiment than would be socially desirable. Both Moore and Netzer regard this as a form of market failure that justi-fies subsidies to the arts.9 Netzer points out that the same problemoccurs in the physical and social sciences, and that “the federal government has a long tradition of subsidizing experimentation onjust these grounds.”10 [@heilbrun-2001-economics p.230]

> Grant-giving bodies have a strong inclination to play it safe by shunning experimentation, perhaps for sound political reasons. They know that opponents of public support (as we see in Chapters 12 and 13) like to reinforce their case by citing what seem to them to be objectionable experimental arts projects that received public support.[@heilbrun-2001-economics p.230]
