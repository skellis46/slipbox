# Adrian Harris - Interoception: The Sixth Sense

_previous note:_ [[interoception]]

> Back in the 1860s, a Russian psychologist called Ivan Sechenov noted the existence of an “obscure muscular sense” at the border of consciousness. He was probably the first to suggest that bodily sensations might be significant, but no one paid much attention. It wasn’t until 1907 that Charles Scott Sherrington named this internal sense ‘interoception’, finally giving a name to our ability to sense bodily signals like heartbeat, breath, thirst, hunger and muscle tension.

> Interoception feeds a vast amount of information to the brain: While most of that input will remain outside conscious awareness, it all significantly impacts our emotional state and thinking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9rddqrvkpcqngkwnht35t9j))


> People with greater interoceptive awareness tend to feel emotions more intensely, are more empathic and are better at emotional regulation. Conversely, research links a lack of interoceptive awareness with emotional disorders. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9rde2t241ex1jcrxcd0e0e9))


> So how can you learn to listen to your body? [I asked Jennifer Tantia](https://embodiedpathways.buzzsprout.com/1931957/13300184-listening-through-the-body-exploring-interoception-and-the-power-of-authentic-movement-with-jennifer), a Somatic Psychotherapist and Dance Movement therapist. Many years ago, Jennifer “went on a quest” to find the answer to a vital question: “How am I going to teach people how to get into their bodies?” Jennifer explains that the body is “a gateway between consciousness and unconsciousness”, and she talks us through ways we can learn the path through that gateway. The key is to “really pay attention, start listening through [your] body”. You need to let go and be open to listening and receiving information “outside of what you think you know”.

> “You can’t just do it once and get it. It’s a practice; it’s tolerating your own frustration, it’s letting yourself be surprised until everything is a surprise. And that’s presence, right, and it’s worth the effort to practice”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9rdg2ftypvw8sq3vgzsdqja))
