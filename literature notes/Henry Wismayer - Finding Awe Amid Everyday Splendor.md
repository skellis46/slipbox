## Highlights

> Think back to the last memory you have of feeling awestruck, and chances are that the sensation was “embodied.” Like Ekman’s original universal emotions, awe is often expressed by facial and physical modulations that defy cultural boundaries. During one conversation, I told Keltner about my then four-year-old daughter’s bawling reaction to the emotional climax of “Inside Out,” the Pixar movie for which he was the [scientific advisor](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/inside-out-behind-the-scenes-science-with-dacher-keltner-phd.html). The memory sent a shiver up my arms and Keltner spotted it (“Ah! Awe’s bodily response!”), which seemed to give him no end of glee.

> Other studies have suggested that awe — alongside another self-transcendent emotion, compassion — is the emotion most likely to [activate](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-athletes-way/201705/awe-engages-your-vagus-nerve-and-can-combat-narcissism) the vagus nerve. The longest of our 12 cranial nerves, the vagus is believed to regulate the so-called gut-brain axis, the interface between the nervous system and the digestive tract. Though this science is still young, the prevailing hypothesis is that an active vagus nerve, or “healthy vagal tone,” helps to relieve depression and anxiety as well as inflammatory autoimmune conditions such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease.

> While much of the data accrued in support of Keltner’s theories rested on self-reported evidence, the cold biology of these findings tends to cut through. “One of the audiences I speak to the most is medical doctors,” Keltner told me. “They traffic in the language of the body. And if you go to them and say awe lowers inflammation —” he clicked his fingers “— they start prescribing getting into nature.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj7cr4ac8b7g671vafbvp2h))


> For the most part, however, awe was something I incubated by chasing what the psychologist Abraham Maslow called “[peak experiences](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-peak-experiences-2795268).” Like Keltner, I have always been interested in the difficult art of happiness precisely because happiness has so often felt slippery. I was skeptical about how much awe could be corralled at will, and even more that it could be reliably cultivated in mundane contexts.

> In reality, opportunities to feel awe are all around us — in our surroundings, our relationships, our daily lives. In Keltner’s surveys, subjects reported feeling awe an average of around [twice a week](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32955293/). Moreover, awe is regenerative. “That was one of our most surprising discoveries — that the more you feel awe, the more it becomes omnipresent,” he said. “That runs counter to an assumption about human pleasure — that the more we eat ice cream, the less we like it. Awe is different. But you have to put the work in.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsj7g6db6cfstt4fvq1j64k1))
