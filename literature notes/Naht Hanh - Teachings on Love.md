# Thich Naht Hanh - Teachings on Love

_previous note:_ [[consciousness as a full-body phenomenon]]

> To practice this love meditation from the _Visuddhimagga_, sit still, calm your body and your breathing, and recite, "May I be peaceful, happy, and light in body and spirit. May I be safe and free from injury. May I be free from anger, afflictions, fear, and anxiety."[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.25] 

> To love is first of all to accept yourself as you actually are. "Knowing thyself" is the first practice of love.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.30]

> "May I be able to recognize and touch the seeds of joy and happiness in myself." _Sarvabijaka_ ("all the seeds") is a word used in Buddhism to describe our consciousness. We are the gardeners who identify, water, and cultivate the best seeds. We need some faith that there are good seeds within us, and then, with appropriate attention, we need to touch those seeds while we practice sitting meditation, walking meditation, and throughout the day.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.39]

> But instead of telling the other person, "Please, come and help with the work," you say to yourself, "Why should I have to say something to her? She should be more responsible!" You think that way because you already have some internal formation about the other person. The shortest way is always the direct way. "B" can go to "A" and say, "Sister, please come and help." But you do not do that. You keep it to yourself and blame the other person.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.75]

> But, most important, I would not transmit to anyone else what "B" tells me in confidence. If I am not mindful, I may tell others what I now know about "B's" feelings, and soon the family or the community will be a mess. if I do these things—encourage "B" to speak directly to "A" or speak with "A" on "B's" behalf, and not tell anyone else what "B" has told me—I will be able to break the triangle.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.76]


> [Maudgalyayana] says that when we are too caught up in a strong bad habit, our friends will not be able to counsel or assist us, and we will be in difficult straits. Because we will not listening to our friends, their affection wanes, and we lost the opportunity to transform our ways.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.131]
