# Flour From Grains and Pulses to Nuts and Seeds by Christine McFadden

Several research studies indicate that coeliac disease affects no more than 1–2 per cent of the population, and gluten sensitivity only 6–10 per cent. These figures are not intended to undermine sufferers; they are simply to put things in perspective.


Given the crucial and beneficial role of gluten in baking, and indeed the importance of bread throughout the world, the strident anti-gluten backlash seems baffling. As Doctor Stephen Jones and Bethany Econopouly, research assistant at The Bread Lab (Washington State University–Mount Vernon Research Center), wrote in a recent article for Gastronomica magazine, ‘Journalists, writers, film-makers, lobbyists, retailers and scientists have jumped on board to get to the bottom of, make us feel better (and worse) about, and personally gain from this out-of-control food movement.’


It also makes what I call the chip to excel all chips. Mix one part chickpea flour with two-parts water and stir over a medium heat. Once you have a lump-free polenta-like porridge, tip it into an oiled shallow rectangular tin and leave to cool to a thick slab. Slice into slim batons and fry in piping hot oil. Your chips will be golden crisp on the outside and superbly creamy within. Alternatively, do as the Burmese do and slice the cooled slab into cubes of ‘tofu’, to serve as a snack. It can be mixed with turmeric for a more intense colour. Food writer Naomi Duguid calls this one of the great unsung treasures of Southeast Asia.


Like all starches, cornflour is made up of tightly knit chains of molecules. When heated in liquid to 62–70°C (143–158°F) they expand and collide with each other, and in doing so form a mesh that thickens the liquid – a process called gelatinization.


NutriBullet


Rye has interesting nutritional credentials. Unusually for a grain, it has a high level of dietary fibre in the actual endosperm – the starchy inner part of a grain – whereas fibre is normally located in the outer layer of bran. This particular fibre is called beta-glucan, known to lower blood cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. Rye flour is also a good source of iron, B-vitamins and resistant starch, which generally improves gut health.


Depending on processing, rye flour is high in certain types of protein, though not in the two proteins that make up gluten: glutenin and gliadin (see Gluten). It’s low in glutenin, which gives strength and structure to dough, but high in gliadin (aka ‘secalin’ in rye), which is responsible for stretchiness. As far as the baker is concerned, this means that the bread dough will be elastic but won’t have the necessary strength to hold its shape.


Also popular in Italy is pane di Altamura, a special semolina bread from the region just above Italy’s heel. Made with semola rimacinata, it’s a rich golden yellow with a contrasting dark crust that, by law, must be more than 3mm (1∕10in) thick. It’s one of the most enticing breads imaginable.


Wheat is an annual plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. The most important species is Triticum aestivum (from the Latin Triticum meaning threshing or bruising, and aestivum meaning summer) or bread wheat. There is also T. durum (meaning hard) or semolina wheat, and related species such as einkorn (T. monococcum), emmer (T. dicoccum) and spelt (T. spelta). (See individual entries for detail.)


Stone grinding (see The miller’s tale) is the traditional method in which wheat grains are crushed between two stones, one slowly rotating, the other static. The bran and the germ are left intact, producing flour that remains one hundred per cent wholemeal throughout the process. The flour isn’t subjected to heat, it retains the nutrients and has more flavour. Understandably it’s the method preferred by bread enthusiasts.
