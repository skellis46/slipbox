#  Hutt - Corrective alignment and injury prevention strategies: Science, somatics or both?

_previous note:_ [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

This is a review article by Kimberley Hutt that explores the ways in which a combination of science and somatics might be beneficial in dance training, and specifically with regard to improved alignment and injury prevention. It is not clear what Hutt means by 'somatics' other than sensory or self awareness.

The writing describes how there is little or no evidence (other than anecdotal) that somatic practices decrease the risk of injury (or indeed improve injury recovery), even though Hutt describes many examples of how _sensory awareness_ is seen as fundamental.

- contrast with [[Mehling - If It All Comes Down to Bodily Awareness]]: a comprehensive review of so much clinical work that shows improvement through somatic-based inquiries and practices (and based on idea that increased bodily awareness is underlying cause)
