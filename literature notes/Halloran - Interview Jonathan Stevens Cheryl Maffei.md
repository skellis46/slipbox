# Halloran: An Interview With Jonathan Stevens and Cheryl Maffei by Wordloaf

<https://newsletter.wordloaf.org/p/the-hungry-ghost-bread-book>

> JS: The book is a book version of the bakery. It’s meant to document our process, and the preciousness of bread—not necessarily our bread, but bread itself—and the process of making stuff. To show that everybody should be able to make stuff and make stuff that you can ingest and make memories with. It’s an interweaving of the technical and the personal. I tried not to enmesh the technical and personal too much because that makes it hard for people to get the information they need. I tried to not make it too precious; in some sense it's precious but it's just bread.


> Going out to dinner with my dad, when bread would come to the table he would grab a piece, and if you could take the center out and make it look like dough again, we couldn't eat it. It was deemed fundamentally undigestible, and this is before any of us knew anything about sourdough.

> I really like how you talk about the precision required of baking but also the improvisation.

> The dough is the manifestation of nature in our domestic lives, right, and it's alive and we have to not just manipulate it we have to collaborate with it. We have to know that it has a life of its own. If we want it to feed us, we have to really give it what it needs every day.

> Like spelt, khorasan is an older cousin of wheat, with a somewhat different protein makeup. Named for its land of origin in present-day northeastern Iran, it is a hard durum wheat with a beautiful yellow tinge. Many Americans are familiar with a trademarked version of it called Kamut, though that sports a supposed Egyptian provenance. Also like spelt, khorasan has good extensibility, so I recommend using white rather than whole wheat. Unlike spelt, khorasan also has quite a bit of elasticity and can handle a remarkable amount of hydration, both in cracker and bread dough. Kalonji seeds are little flavor bombs that are used throughout Central Asia and beyond. They are also known as nigella, charnushka, black cumin, or Roman coriander. They are the seeds of a flowering plant known variously as love-in-a-mist or devil-in-the-bush—depending on how you feel about the taste? Or perhaps it’s not an either/or, but rather love-in-a-mist-with-a-devil-in-the-bush. Spicy stuff, anyhow. We use half as much as we do sesame seeds in the Sesame-Spelt Crackers. Otherwise, this cracker has similar proportions.
