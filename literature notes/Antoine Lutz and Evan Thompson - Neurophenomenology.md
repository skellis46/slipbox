## Highlights

> At a methodological level, the neurophenomeno- logical strategy is to make rigorous and extensive use offirst-person data about subjective experience as a heuristic to describe and quantify the large-scale neurodynamics of consciousness (Lutz 2002). The paper foocuses on neurophenomenology in relation to three challenging methodological issues about incorporating first-person data into cognitive neuroscience: (i) first-person reports can be biased or inaccurate; (ii) the process ofgenerating first-person reports about an experience can modify that experience; and (iii) there is an ‘ex- planatory gap’ in our understanding ofhow to relate first-person, phenomeno- logical data to third-person, biobehavioural data.
