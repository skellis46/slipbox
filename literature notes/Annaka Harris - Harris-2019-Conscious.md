## Highlights

> Consciousness is experience itself, and it is therefore easy to miss the profound question staring us in the face in each moment: Why would any collection of matter in the universe be conscious? We look right past the mystery as if the existence of consciousness were obvious or an inevitable result of complex life, but when we look more closely, we find that it is one of the strangest aspects of reality.[@harris-2019-conscious loc 22]

> The most basic definition of consciousness is that given by the philosopher Thomas Nagel in his famous essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?,” and it is how I use the word throughout this book. The essence of Nagel’s explanation runs as follows: (Location 43)

> An organism is conscious if there is something that it is like to be that organism.1 (Location 46)


> The philosopher Rebecca Goldstein paints a wonderfully clear and playful portrait of the mystery: Sure, consciousness is a matter of matter—what else could it be, since that’s what (Location 65)
> we are—but still, the fact that some hunks of matter have an inner life . . . is unlike any other properties of matter we have yet encountered, much less accounted for. The laws of matter in motion can produce this, all this? Suddenly, matter wakes up and takes in the world?2 (Location 67)


> The mystery of consciousness rivals one of the greatest conundrums ever to bend human thought: How could something appear out of nothing?3 (Location 70)


> The Australian philosopher David Chalmers famously termed this the “hard problem” of consciousness.4 Unlike the “easy problems” of explaining animal behavior or understanding which processes in the brain give rise to which functions, the hard problem lies in understanding why some of these physical processes have an experience associated with them at all. (Location 72)


> An intuition is simply the powerful sense that something is true without our having an awareness or an understanding of the reasons behind this feeling— (Location 97)


> the false intuition that I could even choose to leave my body (if I could only figure out how) and everything constituting “me” would somehow remain magically intact. (Location 259)


+++++ 
- Note: Embodiment refers to recognition of this illusion?


> As a domain that pertains to suffering, all conversations about ethics are about how something feels. (Location 294)


> Even though we are talking about modifying a conscious experience, consciousness itself isn’t necessarily controlling the system; all we know is that consciousness is experiencing the system. (Location 296)


> Sit in a quiet place and give yourself a choice—to lift either your arm or your foot—that must be made before a given time (before the second hand on the clock reaches the six, for example). Do this over and over again and observe your moment-to-moment experience closely. Notice how this choice gets made in real time and what it feels like. Where does the decision come from? Do you decide when to decide, or does a decision simply arise in your conscious experience? Does a free-floating conscious will somehow deliver the thought, Move your arm, or is the thought delivered to you? What actually made you choose arm over foot? It may suddenly seem that “you” (meaning your conscious experience) didn’t have any part in it. (Location 303)


> much more accurate to say that consciousness is along for the ride—watching the show, rather than creating or controlling it. In theory, we can go as far as to say that few (if any) of our behaviors need consciousness in order to be carried out. But at an intuitive level, we assume that because human beings act in certain ways and are conscious—and because experiences such as fear, love, and pain feel like such powerful motivators within consciousness—our behaviors are driven by our awareness of them and otherwise would not occur. (Location 368)


> However, in my own musings, I have stumbled into what might be an interesting exception: consciousness seems to play a role in behavior when we think and talk about the mystery of consciousness. When I contemplate “what it’s like” to be something, that experience of consciousness presumably affects the subsequent processing taking place in my brain. (Location 375)


> And almost nothing I think or say when contemplating consciousness would make any sense coming from a system without it. (Location 377)


> And when I turn these ideas over in my mind, the fact that my thoughts are about the experience of consciousness suggests that there is a feedback loop of sorts and that consciousness is affecting my brain processing. After all, my brain can think about consciousness only after experiencing it (one would presume). (Location 394)


> Imagine what your experience would be like if binding didn’t take place at all—if, when playing the piano, for instance, you first saw your finger hit the key, then heard the note, and later finally felt the key hammer down. Or imagine if the process of binding were tampered with and you found yourself running before you heard the barking of the ferocious dog. (Location 417)


> Without binding processes, you might not even feel yourself to be a self at all. Your consciousness would be more like a flow of experiences in a particular location in space—which would be much closer to the truth. Is it possible to simply be aware of events, actions, feelings, thoughts, and sounds—all coming in a stream of awareness? Such an experience is not uncommon in meditation, and many people, myself included, can attest to it. The self we seem to inhabit most (if not all) of the time—a localized, unchanging, solid center of consciousness—is an illusion that can be short-circuited, without changing our experience of the world in any other way. (Location 419)


> We can have a full awareness of the usual sights, sounds, feelings, and thoughts, absent the sense of being a self who is the receiver of the sounds and the thinker of the thoughts. This is not at all at odds with modern neuroscience: an area of the brain known as the default mode network, which scientists believe contributes to our sense of self, has been found to be suppressed during meditation.1 (Location 423)

- Note: Gwt these foonotes as well


> How to Change Your Mind, on the scientific research of psychedelics: The more precipitous the drop-off in blood flow and oxygen consumption in the default mode network, the more likely a volunteer was to report the loss of a sense of self. . . . The psychedelic experience of “non-duality” suggests that consciousness survives the disappearance of the self, that it is not so indispensable as we—and it—like to think.4 (Location 434)


> Pollan points out that “our sense of individuality and separateness hinges on a bounded self and a clear demarcation between subject and object. But all that may be a mental construction, a kind of illusion.”6 (Location 447)


> The Buddhist scholar Andrew Olendzki describes the illusory nature of self that can be revealed through meditation: Like the flatness of the earth or the solidity of the table, it [the notion of self] has utility at a certain level of scale—socially, linguistically, legally—but thoroughly breaks down when examined with closer scrutiny.9 (Location 465)


> There is a wonderful term, umwelt, introduced by the biologist Jakob von Uexküll in 1909, to describe the given experience of any particular animal, based on the senses used by that organism to navigate its environment. Bats have one umwelt, bees experience another, humans another, and someone using a technology like the BrainPort experiences yet another. (Location 492)


> Seth refers to our experiences of ourselves in the world as a kind of “controlled hallucination.” He describes the brain as a “prediction engine” and explains that “what we perceive is its best guess of what’s out there in the world.” In a sense, he says, “we predict ourselves into existence.”14 (Location 511)


> the psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist describes his intriguing thesis about the possibility that consciousness originates much deeper in the structures of the brain than scientists typically believe: It seems to me more fruitful to think of consciousness not as something with sharp edges that is suddenly arrived at once one reaches the very top of mental functioning, but as a process that is gradual, rather than all-or-nothing, and begins low down in the brain. . . . The problem then becomes not how two wills can become one unified consciousness, but how one field of consciousness can accommodate two wills. . . . Consciousness is not a bird, as it often seems to be in the literature—hovering, detached, coming in at the top level and alighting on the brain somewhere in the frontal lobes—but a tree, its roots deep inside us.19 (Location 569)


> If we can’t point to anything that distinguishes which collections of atoms in the universe are conscious from those that aren’t, where can we possibly hope to draw the line? Perhaps a more interesting question is why we should draw a line at all. When we view our own experience of consciousness as being “along for the ride,” we suddenly find it easier to imagine that other systems are accompanied by consciousness as well. It’s at this point that we must consider the possibility that all matter is imbued with consciousness in some sense—a view referred to as panpsychism.1 (Location 586)


> I love the title of an article by the philosopher Philip Goff: “Panpsychism Is Crazy, but It’s Also Most Probably True.” His line of thinking follows this path: Once we realise that physics tells us nothing about the intrinsic nature of the entities it talks about, and indeed that the only thing we know for certain about the intrinsic nature of matter is that at least some material things have experience . . . the theoretical imperative to form as simple and unified a view as is consistent with the data leads us quite straightforwardly in the direction of panpsychism.2 (Location 604)


> The natural tendency of scientific exploration is to arrive at as simple an explanation as possible, and the concept of consciousness emerging out of nonconscious material represents a kind of failure of the typical goal of scientific explanation. In philosophy, this jump from a nonconscious to a conscious state of matter is referred to as “radical” or “strong” emergence.3 (Location 623)


> Figure 6.1: Emergence. A phenomenon that is not predicted by the constituent parts, and is more complex than the sum of its parts, is referred to as an emergent phenomenon. (Location 645)


> But as others have pointed out, consciousness is the one thing that can’t be an illusion—by definition. An illusion can appear within consciousness, but you are either experiencing something or you’re not—consciousness is necessary for an illusion to take place. In his essay “The Consciousness Deniers,” the British analytic philosopher Galen Strawson analyzes this view of consciousness-as-illusion and expresses exasperation with the utter incoherence of the idea: “How could anybody have been led to something so silly as to deny the existence of conscious experience, the only general thing we know for certain exists?”7 (Location 649)


> In fact, Strawson posits that “panpsychism is the most plausible theoretical view to adopt if one is an out-and-out naturalist . . . who holds that physicalism is true,” that “everything that concretely exists is physical,” and that “all physical phenomena are forms of energy.” He concludes that “panpsychism is simply a hypothesis about the ultimate intrinsic nature of this energy, the hypothesis that the intrinsic nature of energy is experience. . . . Physics is untouched by this hypothesis. Everything true in physics remains true.”10 (Location 662)


> Many neuroscientists do admit, however, that the hard problem will persist, because scientific understanding, no matter how complete, seems to have no way of offering us direct insight into the subjective experience associated with those physical properties—studying systems like the brain simply delivers us more information about physical properties. The neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran, for example, has conceded that “qualia” (the experiential qualities of consciousness that we can label, such as what it’s like to see the color blue or feel something sharp) will remain a puzzle: Qualia are vexing to philosophers and scientists alike because even though they are palpably real and seem to lie at the very core of mental experience, physical and computational theories about brain function are utterly silent on the question of how they might arise or why they might exist.11 (Location 669)


> The fact remains, however, that the majority of scientists believe that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon resulting from neuronal processing. Most assume that if “we” are not conscious of certain experiences and brain processes, there must not be any experience associated with them at all. This may be true, but as we will see, it may not make sense to follow that line of reasoning. (Location 701)


> And even though, as mentioned earlier, Thomas Nagel’s definition of the word “consciousness” (i.e., being like something) is the most accurate way to talk about subjective experience, there are a variety of ways people use the word (the capacity for self-reflection, wakefulness, alertness, etc.), which causes additional confusion. (Location 728)


> Another potential source of erroneous arguments against panpsychism is based in evolution, as most scientific and philosophical support for the idea that consciousness is confined to the nervous systems of living things relies in part on the assertion that consciousness is a product of biological evolution. (Location 746)


> But if consciousness doesn’t determine our behavior as we have traditionally assumed, the evolution argument doesn’t hold up. How can consciousness increase the likelihood of survival if it doesn’t affect our behavior in the typical sense? (Location 749)


> We should be as surprised by the reality of our own consciousness as we would be to learn that the latest smartphone is conscious. (Location 758)


> In a 2017 essay titled “Minding Matter,” Adam Frank, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester, eloquently expresses both the mystery of consciousness and the reluctance of scientists to propose theories that venture beyond viewing consciousness as a result of processing in the brain: It is as simple as it is undeniable: after more than a century of profound explorations into the subatomic world, our best theory for how matter behaves still tells us very little about what matter is. Materialists appeal to physics to explain the mind, but in modern physics the particles that make up a brain remain, in many ways, as mysterious as consciousness itself. . . . Rather than trying to sweep away the mystery of mind by attributing it to the mechanisms of matter, we must grapple with the intertwined nature of the two. . . . Consciousness might, for example, be an example of the emergence of a new entity in the Universe not contained in the laws of particles. There is also the more radical possibility that some rudimentary form of consciousness must be added to the list of things, such as mass or electric charge, that the world is built of.19 (Location 762)


> To overcome this anthropocentric perspective, the panpsychist asks us to see the “mentality” of other objects not in terms of human consciousness but as a subset of a certain universal quality of physical things, in which both inanimate mentality and human consciousness are taken as particular manifestations.20 (Location 784)


> it seems quite hard for us to drop the intuition that consciousness equals complex thought. (Location 803)


> Visualize the most basic experience imaginable. Next, bring in sounds, then tastes, then smells—each arriving one at a time in as pure a form as possible. You’re simply experiencing what arrives in your awareness, without words or concepts to describe what the experience is like. And finally, imagine the feeling of touch coming online in the form of pressure or heat—spanning broad areas and in small, pinpoint locations—not in your body, of course, since you don’t have one, but in locations in space. . . . It’s difficult to maintain this type of imagery for long, but we can get enough of a sense of such a state to imagine that, at the very least, something like it is possible. (Location 816)


> It seems possible to be acutely aware of one’s subjective experience in the absence of thought, sights, sounds, or any other perception. (Location 823)


> Rebecca Goldstein makes the case that we in fact already know that consciousness is integral to matter because we are made of matter ourselves, and it is the one property we have direct access to: Consciousness is an intrinsic property of matter; indeed, it’s the only intrinsic property of matter that we know, for we know it directly, by ourselves being material conscious things. All of the other properties of matter have been discovered by way of mathematical physics, and this mathematical method of getting at the properties of matter means that only relational properties of matter are known, not intrinsic properties.1 (Location 827)


> Galen Strawson makes a similar point by turning the mystery of consciousness on its head. He argues that consciousness is in fact the only thing in the universe that is not a mystery—in the sense that it is the only thing we truly understand firsthand. (Location 833)


> And he has dubbed this “the hard problem of matter”: [Physics] tells us a great many facts about the mathematically describable structure of physical reality, facts that it expresses with numbers and equations . . . but it doesn’t tell us anything at all about the intrinsic nature of the stuff that fleshes out this structure. Physics is silent—perfectly and forever silent—on this question. . . . What is the fundamental stuff of physical reality, the stuff that is structured in the way physics reveals? The answer, again, is that we don’t know—except insofar as this stuff takes the form of conscious experience.2 (Location 835)


> The claim is just the opposite—that if consciousness exists as a fundamental property, complex systems, built from that-which-is-already-streaming -consciousness, could eventually give rise to physical structures such as human minds. (Location 844)


> David Skrbina addresses the problem of anthropic projections, in which we “place the demands of human consciousness on inanimate particles,” and he explains the necessity of distinguishing between consciousness and memory: Certainly anything like the human mind requires a human-like memory, but this is relevant only for complex organisms. It is not reasonable to demand that atomic particles have anything like the memory capability of the human being, or even any physical instantiation of something like memory. Minds of atoms may conceivably be, for example, a stream of instantaneous memory-less moments of experience.3 (Location 846)


> But perhaps it’s wrong to talk about a subject of consciousness, and it’s more accurate to instead talk about the content available to conscious experience at any given location in space-time, determined by the matter present there—umwelts applied not just to organisms, but to all matter, in every configuration and at every point in space-time. (Location 867)


> We run into a combination problem only when we drag the concept of a “self” or a “subject” into the equation. But we know that the idea of the self, as a concrete entity, is an illusion. It’s admittedly a very tough illusion to relinquish, but I think the solution to the combination problem is that there is really no “combining” going on at all with respect to consciousness itself. Consciousness could persist as is, while the character and content change, depending on the arrangement of the specific matter in question. Maybe content is sometimes shared across large, intricately connected regions and sometimes confined to very small ones, perhaps even overlapping. (Location 892)


> The illusion of being a self, along with an experience of continuity over time through memory, may in fact be a very rare form of consciousness. (Location 912)


> I agree with the conclusion that Murray Shanahan, a professor of cognitive robotics at Imperial College London, arrives at: To situate human consciousness within a larger space of possibilities strikes me as one of the most profound philosophical projects we can undertake. It is also a neglected one. With no giants upon whose shoulders to stand, the best we can do is cast a few flares into the darkness.10 (Location 960)


> But we can still wonder how conscious experience itself relates to time. Paying close attention to one’s moment-to-moment experience through a concentration exercise like meditation—or simply contemplating the mystery of one’s felt experience in general—leads to many interesting questions pertaining to time: How much time does a moment of consciousness take? Is consciousness continuous or does it somehow flicker in and out (and how would we know the difference)? What is the present moment; is it some sort of illusion? Is time itself an illusion?
