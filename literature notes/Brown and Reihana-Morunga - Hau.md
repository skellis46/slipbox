#  Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau: Living Archive of Breath

_previous note:_ [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]

---

> Life is cultivated by life itself, in breathing. This practice produces a distance, an estrangement, a proper becoming that is a renunciation of adherence to the environment. The near becomes one’s own, through air. If breathing estranges me from the other, this gesture also signifies a sharing with the world that surrounds me and with the community that inhabits it ... I can breathe in my own way, but the air will never simply be mine. [Irigaray 2001: 309, in @brown-2020-hau p.69]
