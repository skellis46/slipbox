## Highlights

> When our doing comes out of being, it becomes an integral and intimate part of a love affair with awareness itself, and with our ability to inhabit that space in our own mind and heart and to share it with others who are also engaged in that way of being as well—potentially all of us. (Location 78)


> And since the paradox is that all of us are already who we are in our fullness, this means that in the cultivation of mindfulness, there is literally no place to go, nothing to do, and no special experience that you are missing or are supposed to have. The fact that you are able to experience anything at all is already extremely special. (Location 99)


> There are no words for this because words are merely, for all their power and beauty when strung together skillfully, elements of thinking about things and thus once removed from direct apprehension. (Location 108)


> At this point, we are tapping into what one colleague* tellingly calls implicational holistic meaning—much more akin to directly feeling something and knowing it in one’s bones, in one’s heart, way beneath the words and concepts we may apply to the experience later. Perhaps in the end, it is this capacity that makes us human rather than automatons. And it is precisely here that we intersect with the domain of embodied mindfulness practice. (Location 111)


> This book and the others in this series are full of words, thousands of them. And yet, none of them are anything but pointers, sight lines for you to look along, feel along, sense along as you stop and drop, stop and drop, stop and drop in, moment by moment. (Location 118)


> And the only way to realize it is to get out of your own way for a moment and simply stop and drop in, stop and drop in, stop and drop in. One convenient way to do that is by attending to experience via your senses. (Location 127)


> None of us wants to have “I should have spent more time working” or “I wish I had been more distracted” on our gravestone, but many of us act that way in how we allocate our energies and in the sum total of our missed moments (Location 150)


> In other words, can you hold what you are experiencing in awareness without judging it in any way or creating a narrative that you wind up believing about your experience—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? (Location 176)


> Being in touch with our senses—considerably more than five, as modern neuroscience is showing—and the worlds they open us to inwardly and outwardly is the essence of mindfulness and meditative awareness. (Location 232)


> The relative divergence of my bodily senses (eyes in the front of the head, ears toward the back, etc.) and their curious bifurcation (not one but two eyes, one on each side, and similarly two ears, two nostrils, etc.) indicates that this body is a form destined to the world; it ensures that my body is a sort of open circuit that completes itself only in things, in others, in the encompassing earth. (Location 297)

- Note: Abrams: spell of the sensuous


> Subject (seer) and object (what is seen) unite in the moment of seeing. Otherwise it is not seeing. (Location 361)


> Carl Jung observed that “We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect; we apprehend it just as much through feeling.” Marcel Proust put it this way: The true journey of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having fresh eyes. (Location 369)


> The goal would be to see things more as they actually are rather than how we would like them to be or fear them to be, or only registering what we are socially conditioned to see or feel. (Location 373)


> Seeing and being seen complete a mysterious circuit of reciprocity, a reciprocity of presence that Thich Nhat Hanh calls “interbeing.” That presence holds us and reassures us and lets us know that our inclination to be who we actually are and to show ourselves in our fullness is a healthy impulse, because who we actually are has been seen, recognized, and accepted, our core sovereignty-of-being acknowledged, embraced. (Location 416)

> For a brief moment perhaps, we have actually come to, arrived at, our senses. Can we abide here for a time? Can we live here? (Location 466)


> That is not to say that thoughts do not arise. They do. It is rather to say that their presence no longer colors the hearing or interferes with it. It is almost as if the thoughts themselves have become sounds and are heard and known along with everything else, in their arising and in their passing. They no longer distract or disturb, for in being known, they tend to melt away, no longer proliferating endlessly. (Location 513)


> The knowing is skylike, airlike. Like space, it is everywhere, boundless. It is nothing other than awareness itself. Pure. Utterly simple. It is also utterly mysterious for it is not something that I am creating but rather a quality not separate from being alive that sometimes emerges, like a shy animal come to sun itself on a log in a forest clearing. It lingers if I am quiet and don’t make sudden movements within the space of the mind. (Location 516)


> Ashley Montague, in his classic book Touch: The Human Significance of the Skin, observed that the word “touch” has the distinction of the longest entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. That means that it is longer even than the entry for the word “love.” (Location 664)


> The sense of touch is actually, from a neurological point of view, a number of different senses all subsumed under the same word. Sensing the pressure of contact is one. Sensing the temperature of contact is another. Sensing contact that is so intense it causes us pain is yet another, as is sensing a caress so loving it gives us pleasure. (Location 683)


> The skin is a sensory world unto itself. It is never devoid of sensation, even when it doesn’t seem to be touching anything. For it is always touching something by virtue of being an interface. It has its own sensory tone at all times. It is always in touch. (Location 734)


> I guess that is why we eat delicious food, because just reading about it, even if the writer is gifted, may conjure up hunger, but it will never satisfy that hunger or give us the actual flavor itself. For that we have to take it into our mouths ourselves and taste it in order to know it. Here the tasting is the knowing. (Location 832)


> In any moment, then, we might actually come in touch with our own wholeness, our own beauty, beyond name and form, beyond appearance, beyond liking and disliking, beyond good and bad. Here, and only here, is peace to be found. Here, and only here, can we contribute our wisdom, our energies, and our love to those we love and to the world. And we do that through embodying our intimacy with the mindscape. So we could say that the mindscape includes the bodyscape, the realm of all the senses, the body itself, and vice versa. Mysteriously, the mindscape is utterly embodied, and thus, intrinsically compassionate as well as wise. Why? Because of the boundless, all-inclusive nature of awareness itself, far beyond our body, driving an inevitable recognition of universal interconnectedness, and thus of self in other and other in self. (Location 920)


> There are countless creative ways to bring the body scan or any other lying down meditation into your life. If you make use of any of them, it is highly likely that you will find that they will bring new life to you, and bring you to a new appreciation for your body and how much it can serve as a vehicle for embodying here and now what is deepest and best in yourself, including your dignity, your beauty, your vitality, and your mind when it is open and undisturbed. (Location 1143)


> We can and need to be kind and gentle with ourselves, and at the same time sit as if our lives depended on it. Because, when it comes right down to it, they surely do. (Location 1157)


> The embodiment of dignity inwardly and outwardly immediately reflects and radiates the sovereignty of your life, that you are who and what you are—beyond all words, concepts, and descriptions, and beyond what anybody else thinks about you, or even what you think about you. It is a dignity without self-assertion—not driving forward toward anything, nor recoiling from anything—a balancing in sheer presence, a presencing. (Location 1161)


> When we find that the mind has wandered away from the primary object of our attention, as is bound to happen over and over again, we simply note what is on our mind at the moment we remember the breath and realize that we have not been in touch with it for some time. And we do so without judgment or self-condemnation, again, as best we can. We note that the realization that we are no longer with the breath is itself awareness, and so we are already back in the present moment. Importantly, we do not have to dispel or push away or even remember whatever it was that was preoccupying the mind the moment before. We simply allow the breath to once again resume its place as the primary object of our attention, since it has never not been here and is as available to us in this very moment as in any other. (Location 1208)


> We can also practice sitting with a sense of the body as a whole sitting and breathing. This is a practice I find particularly congenial. Some traditions refer to it as whole body sitting. Here we open to the subtle sensoria of proprioceptive and interoceptive knowing as well as to the more individual isolated sensations within the body. Awareness now embraces the entirety of the body, including the skin, and the sitting posture itself. (Location 1229)


> Yet the overall stance remains the same: resting in awareness itself and seeing, hearing, feeling, sensing, knowing whatever it is that is being seen, heard, felt, sensed, or known in the moment of its arising, the moment of its lingering, and the moment of its passing away. We are the knowing because we align with that in us that is most fundamental, our capacity for awareness, for knowing itself, beyond the conventional boundaries of name and form and concepts of any kind. (Location 1239)


> As best we can, we note their content, the emotional charge they carry (again, pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral), and their evanescent and passing nature, while attempting, again, as best we can, not to be drawn into the content of any thought, which we will easily find will merely lead to another thought, image, memory, or fantasy, carrying us away in the stream of one thought proliferating into the next, rather than staying with the knowing frame in which all thoughts are seen with a degree of equanimity, discerned as events with content and emotional charge, and left alone to simply be what they are, momentary events arising, lingering, and dissolving in the mindscape, in the field of awareness itself. (Location 1248)


> And then there is the practice of choiceless awareness. Given that the field of awareness we have been cultivating through the various practices described above is fundamentally limitless by nature, we can expand our awareness still further, beyond even attending specifically to the stream of our own thoughts and emotions arising and passing away in each moment. We can, instead, allow the field of awareness to be essentially infinite, boundless, like space itself, or like the sky, noting that it can include any and all aspects of our experience, interior and exterior, sensory, perceptual, somatic, emotional, cognitive as primary objects of attention, and that we can rest in this vast, sky-like field of awareness without choosing among or specifically featuring any of these particular occurrences. Instead, we allow them all to come and go, appear and disappear, as they will, and be known in their fullness from moment to moment within the nowscape. This is the practice of what Krishnamurti called choiceless awareness, akin to the practice of shikan-taza, or “just sitting—nothing more” in Zen, and to Dzogchen in the Tibetan tradition (Location 1282)


> And perhaps there is no longer any “you” who “has” to be listening, and nothing to be listened for or to. There is, instead, just hearing, before and underneath everything else, just the bare experience of hearing and the non-conceptual awareness of hearing that mindfulness already is. (Location 1560)


> The subject (you) and the object (the breath, or even “my breath”) dissolve into breathing, pure and simple, and into an awareness that needs no “you” to generate it, that already knows breathing as it is unfolding, beyond thinking, underneath thinking, before thinking, just as we saw for hearing. (Location 1593)


> And although it is natural that we say that “I am breathing” and that it is “my” breath, it is also helpful to keep in mind that the fact of the matter is that if it were up to us to keep the breathing going, we would have died long ago. We are too distractible and unreliable to be in charge of the breathing process. We get caught up in a thought, or get a text or an e-mail and forget about keeping the breathing going and… whoops, we are dead. So whoever you think you are, your very biology doesn’t allow “you” anywhere near the circuitry of the brainstem, the phrenic nerve, and the diaphragm that together keep you breathing, even during sleep. It would be much more accurate to say that you are being breathed rather than claiming that you are breathing. That would be much less self-centered. (Location 1602)


> It is impossible to enter into a building through all its various doors at once, and folly just to keep going in and out through them. If you do, you will never wind up spending any time inside. (Location 1632)


> with the five so-called classical “hindrances” in the Buddha’s teaching, which are indeed universal aspects of an untrained mind: sensual desire or greed; ill will or aversion; sloth and torpor—truly wonderful adjectives; restlessness, worry, and remorse; and doubt. (Location 1883)


> Most important is to not take ourselves too seriously. Remember that mindfulness practice is a radical act of love. That means that compassion and self-compassion lie at its root. If we cannot be gentle with and accepting of ourselves and the experiences we are having now, whatever they are, if we are always wanting some other, better experience to convince ourselves or others that we are “making progress,” that we are becoming a “better person,” then we probably should give up meditating. (Location 1902)


> The soil of deep practice requires the fertilizer of deep self-acceptance and self-compassion. For this reason, gentleness is not a luxury, but a critical requirement for coming to our senses. (Location 1913)
