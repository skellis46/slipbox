# Emma Warren - Dance your Way Home

_previous note:_

> Escapism has always been an adjective used to describe the dance. That's an outsider's view. Solidarity is what it really offers -- Theo Parrish [in @warren-2023-dance p.v]

Original facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/375955904675/posts/overwhelmed-i-wish-i-was-shocked-embarrassed-at-the-lack-of-overt-commentary-fro/10155045234804676/

> Ultimately it begins inside, to the low-frequency quartet of heartbeat, blood flow, digestive rumble and maternal voice. p.15

> Dance is unstoppable expression. Each gesture, flex, slide or shape we make in response to music contains communication and history. We absorb or reject each other's movement in order to signify that we're part of a community or to indicate that we're not. It shapes us, as we make shapes. Movement is bound to music, not separate from it. The Greek root of the word 'music' related to all the arts of the muses, and this included dancing. p.16

> When you're a great street dancer [in] the act of improvising to the music, you're outside of your body and you're inside your body. You're both places simultaneously. -- Tony Basil, in Warren p.18

- Martha Bayless, Folklore and Public Culture (Oregon) wrote a paper on The Fuller Brooch -- "engraving depicts dancing": <https://www.jstor.org/stable/26332316>

> It's a nonsense to talk about whole demographics as if they were one amorphous mass, but allow me a moment to make a very general observation: there's a contingent of people who'd describe themselves as English who are slightly embarrassed by dancing. The Anglo-centric awkwardness I'm talking about expresses itself in a number of ways: the need for drink or drugs as a precursor to movement; or a cloak of 'silliness' that allows for more flexibility. It's cultural.[@warren-2023-dance p.32]

> The community of practitioner-researchers attending the conference were attempting to illuminate the deep past. They have spent years, sometimes decades, trying to catch steps that only existed in the moment. These steps were enacted in bodies that moved according to freedoms and constraints we can only imagine, which perhaps make this archiving task as slippery as attempting to archive one family's laughter. I recognised the generosity: a desperate desire to ensure that precious and hard-won knowledge is passed on, either by writing it down or by demonstrating it so that others can carry the gestural information with them and, in turn, pass it on. p.36
- re "Stepping on" conference in 2019 in Cecil Sharp House, Kennedy Hall 

> I have versions of Englishness that I believe in too, and which are visible on the dancefloor. [...] An England where we recognise the cultural riches that state action diverted to this small collection of islands off the coast of mainland Europe – and one in which we accept what this diversion cost. An England were ordinary dancing is valued, and not just because it indicates an understanding of who we are. p.38

> Traditional dances grow from ordinary steps, the kind people do at home with friends and family. Rules and regulations are imposed on a movement language in order to teach, perform and judge it. At this point, a dance becomes fixed – until the steps are enlivened by new use. Dance is a generous kind of virus that enters our bodies and changes itself as it changes us. Like a virus, it mutates, better to spread. p.39

> I'm purposefully steering away from ideas of dance as ritual, not least because Professor Theresa Buckland pointed out back in 2002 that the idea of dance sharing primitive origins with ritual practices 'emerged quite specifically from traditions of European thought during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries' – particularly what she describes as 'colonialist inequalities' – and that this idea has been 'soundly criticised' by anthropologists of dance and human movement. p.40

> Prominent, powerful people in the UK are disproportionately white and male, often coming from backgrounds that encompass the holy trinity of home ownership, historic land possession and expensive private education. p.43

> [Professor Maxine Leeds Craig] describes the way that a disturbing idea of 'natural awkwardness' emerged, and goes on to nail a powerful thought: 'White middle-class men are rarely reduced to their bodies and the price many of them pay for that privilege is dancefloor awkwardness.' I wonder if certain men and women in Britain, especially those who come from a demographic which once controlled many millions of bodies across the world, absorbed the idea that moving freely presents a risk to status and social standing. Stature through this lens sounds a lot like 'statue'. pp-44-45. 

> Something in the boundary between actor and person fell apart as I watched that scene [in _The Best Man_]. The actors are smiling because they're dancing, no longer the 'uptight college friend' or 'long-suffering girlfriend' or 'womaniser who finds the errors of his ways through prayer'. They're people engaged in the joyful feeling of moving together and seeing their neighbour add a little flourish or a gesture-as-joke. p.50

> Dance is an absorbent medium, shifting and expanding in response to what's in the cultural ether, whether that's Flann O'Brien's cheap dance or a diasporic céilí. Migration is movement in the most literal sense. p.70

> Music is vibrational instruction, and the information contained in a bassline – 'Move! Pause!' – became unavoidable under these circumstances. I felt this in environments that were built, decades later, on reggae's sound-system foundations, like mid-1990s jungle or drum 'n' bass nights, or in the dubstep dances of the mid-2000s. It's impossible not to move, and to feel, when the music is powered in this way. p.88

> [William H. McNeill in _Keeping Together in Time: Dance and Drill in Human History_] believed that moving to music created human-sized communities and, must later, sustained them once settlements developed into cities and – as cities do – began attracting individuals and families from diverse locations. 
> Dancing, perhaps, is the mother of the most basic human invention: humanity. p.112

> Youth clubs suffered the erasure that often happens to culture made by and for people who are young, are of Global Majority ethnicity, are queer or poor or otherwise marginalised. Our society fetishises youth, but we don't appear to like young people very much, and we don't seem very interested in respecting or appreciating these grass-roots conservatoires – or even seeing them. p.117

> It's worth pausing here, briefly, just to remind ourselves again of the fundamental role of the dancer in music culture. To give just one example, consider the way hip hop developed in the late seventies after Jamaican-born DJ Kool Here noticed that dancers responded particularly well to the instrumental sections of old soul records. The idea of mixing between two tracks on two turntables occurred in order to extend the break and to give the dancers more of what they were requesting with their feet and outstretched arms. p.125

> All DJs know that the crowd sometimes likes to move to a familiar tune, like the way a wedding DJ will drop an intergenerational banger – Sweet Female Attitude's 'Flowers' or 'The Twist' by Chubby Checker – and that this can unleash a certain kind of happiness that comes from recognition and moving to music that contains layers of lived experience. p.131

> I have a fragment of a memory from my own school discos: of dancing on the margins, by the canteen shutters, where I might have done some high kicks. A boy – let's call him Gerard – who was tall, and who later got suspended for setting the soles of his shoes on fire, pointed and laughed at me. I stopping doing high kicks, immediately and for ever. Dancing can release and repair, but it can also contain a person within the invisible walls of shame. I was ashamed at having danced wrong, for having confused my love of gymnastics with how to behave at a school disco. It's a reminder that almost anyone can be shamed into stillness and that a snide comment can put someone off for life. p.138

> Dance as part of the curriculum has been in significant decline in UK schools since 2010, according to One Dance UK. The act of moving to music releases endorphins into the bloodstream, which can be useful for children and young adults experiencing worries or challenges. It also improves thinking skills and creative problem-solving, which should be of interest to those who plan the education of our young. A few wonderful schools have embedded dance into the curriculum. I'd say it should be prioritised everywhere else, too. p.145d

about Johnno Burgess:

> 'By the time I did get up, I wouldn't leave the dancefloor, to the point where everyone (p.150) else was bored and wanted to go home and I was still dancing on my own. It's that connection – "Oh my god, all the music I love, I can move around to it!" Something dawned on me, and after that you couldn't stop me.' We have to find our dancing feet somewhere, and it's easier to find them away from the mocking gaze of peers who are acutely attuned to any external manifestation of internal weakness. pp.1149-150

> Youth-oriented dancefloors offered the opportunity to learn that the music sounds better when it's danced to, and when it's communal. Listening is active, and there are elements of music that you can access only by moving to it. Moving together creates connection with the people around you. For better or worse, many people of my generation had the opportunity to learn this together, in schools, in high-street nightclubs and in holiday-camps. p.150

About Anna Duberg's work (in Sweden):

> The research didn't just sit on a library shelf. It became Dans för Hälsa (Dance for Health), which now takes place in 150 cities across Sweden and which has expanded into Hungary and Finland. Her classes fostered a non-judgemental atmosphere and what she calls 'supportive togetherness', something I recognise from the acid-house dancefloors I attended as a teenage girl, carrying my own troubles. She also experienced the benefits of dance for young women, finding that is provided 'integrity', in the sense of stability. 'Dance made it easier for me to know who I was,' she said. 'And to find a value in who I was. It became like a wall, in a positive way. I know I have value because I have found it in my body.' p.165

On Mark Moore taking Philip Glass to an acid-house club:

> 'I arranged to take Philip,' he confirmed, 'so he could experience the music in a suitable environment. We warned Philip that we were going to be taking ecstasy, and I must say we weren't quite sure how we was going to react. "The thing about young people," he said wisely, "is that you think you're the only people who have taken drugs." In the club he didn't dance but listened intently to the music, nodding his head gently in time to the beats. After a while he looked up at me with a big smile and said, "I get it. And I also get why you think my music is connected to your music." ...' p.168

> There is also a story about drugs. Some might say that the popularity of dancing to house music in the late eighties was entirely to do with illegal drugs, predominantly ecstasy. Those people have clearly never experienced what happens to your body when you've been moving together in time with other people for hours and hours. The way your body overtakes your brain; when the music talks directly to your chest. p.173

Regarding the moral panic re acid house:

> I remember reading a report in which a policeman was asked for his perspective on having witnessed thousands of young people racing all night to amplified electronic music. His answer focused on the movement: that the youth were not even dancing with each other any more, they were dancing alone, atomised. He expressed shock at this, but we weren't separate and everyone was included, even those without a partner to dance with. We were together, like tiny dancing dots that – zoomed out – revealed a much bigger picture. p.175

> Professor Theresa Buckland, at the University of Roehampton, described dancing done for pleasure rather than performance, aka social dance, as 'the Cindarella' of academic dance studies. Her phrase suggests to me that everyday dancers and ordinary dancefloors are beautiful and yet have been sidelined, made invisible. p.191

> Culture mattes when everything else falls away. You can't eat culture and it doesn't pay the rent, but it does provide pride and history, which are useful starting points for recovery. p.192

> I am set firmly against anything which veers into 'it was better in the olden days' territory and, generally, I'm with Gil Scott-Heron, who enunciated the 'no' at the start of 'nostalgia'. I believe in the archive as encouragement and permission, but I don't believe in parading generational gains in front of those who lack the physical space we had. However, we're all allowed to break our own rules every now and again, and this is one area where it's probably not possible to avoid it. Clubs in the olden days were properly loud, with speakers either purpose-built in the style of New York's finest underground clubs or borrowed from reggae sound systems. This meant feeling the music as much as hearing it, with all the benefits that sound brings to the body (less so the ears). p.195

> Our bodies are more than just a carriage. We can't separate ourselves from them, like I attempted to do. The idea of a mind-body split is weird, when you think about it. Where is your mind, if not in your body? People talk about mindfulness, but I want an embodied life, in which the self sits in the soft inside of an elbow or in our muscles, not just in our brains. We can access the brain through the body, and our bodies contain ideas and experience. It's not all about the mind, wherever that is. I didn't know this when I was young, but I do now. p.214


Gerald:
> 'I think people need to be educated more about dance and movement and its relationship to music,' he adds. 'I can feel that it's going to be something that people want more of. There's the enjoyment of nodding your head, but you can get past that stage. It's just shyness, really.' p.226

> [Brian Belle-Fortune] quotes MC Det, who differentiated for a multicultural dancefloor with the words, '_If you can't dance, just nod your head._' Dancing was for everybody, or if you separate out the word, for every body. p.235

Talking about young men on drum 'n' bass floors:
> They were taking part in the dance -- even if they did so by standing at the back, puffa jacket on whatever the temperature, nodding their heads and occasionally raising a hand up towards the ceiling. That is dancing, of a very minimal, stoned and masculine kind -- but it's still dancing. Relinquishing control isn't easy, although the payoff, as all everyday dancers know, is communion -- and I'm not talking about the wafter the priest dispensed at 9.15 a.m. Mass. p.237

> East Baltimore poet Kondwani Fidel expressed these realities in the documentary _Dark City Beneath the Beat_, when he said, 'Our dance steps are just our tears in portable form.' It was music producer Rod Lee, though, who provided the ultimate summation of the city's relationship to movement in his sparse yet weighty 2006 track, which appeared on _The Wire's_ soundtrack. It's called 'Dance My Pain Away'. p.251

> The truth is that the street isn't an extension of the dancefloor, it's the other way round. The dancefloor is an extension of the street corner, of the marketplace, of the crossroads. It's all of those communal places, condensed and amplified. p.252

> The loss of dance spots, whether they're formal or informal, makes me think of environmentalist Rob Nixon's phrase 'slow violence', and it seems that this wrecking ball doesn't just stop at the dancehall doorway. It affects all kinds of dancefloors, including shopping centres. pp.252-253.

> 'There are so many ways I started to find [out] who I was thorugh dance,' [Shan Wallace] continues. 'I didn't even think about any of that shit before you asked, but it's the real truth. I spent so much time dancing, being shy about dancing, finding myself through dance ... I think people don't value it. Body movement and dance is survival.' p.254

Archie Burnett talking about lofting (emerged from the Loft in NY in 1970 in David Mancuso's home):
> 'Because wherever you came from you were influenced by everybody else.' The end result was a room in which people moved together. 'Similar to contemporary dance, smoothly done, where you'd use bits and pieces of authentic or acrobatic moves, mixed with intertwining bodies.' Ballerinas adapted their conservatoire-honed techniques to dance music, he says, alongside local kids, whose hard-rock, proto-hip-hop styles would be softened by the open-minded environment and the ban on cameras. pp.256-257

> Where, though, do you go for some musical healing when you've grown out of the dancefloors around you? Some people give up; others find a place where they're welcomed regardless of age. Bob Hill went for the latter. He's in his mid-fifties and is part of a cultural family that met at jazz-funk rollerdiscos and on soul-weekender dancefloors. His dance instruction goes back further, of course -- he remembers his mum stopping him at a family house party and telling him to dance to the bassline, not the drums. Now he's a regular at Patrick Forge and Gilles Peterson's reprises Dingwalls sessions in London where there's a shared understanding of spatial awareness and dancefloor etiquette. 'It's like when you watch starlings or a school of fish,' he says. 'We're all together, but we don't interfere with each other. We move as one.' pp.259-260

> There were hardly any phones on the dancefloor (in this period just before ubiquitous camera phones), and photography was not welcome unless you were Georgina Cook, who went on to publish _Drumz of the South: The Dubstep Years, 2004-2007._ p.292 
(also mentions photographer Dave Swindells photographing acid-house dancers at Heaven)

> Actor and choreographer Adesola Osakalumi was talking about New York house clubs during choreographer Camille Brown's 'Social Dance for Social Change' lecture series when he said, 'The circle is a communal showcase, a stage,' but his words rang true in this Chicago room, too. 'It's a testing ground: iron sharpens iron,' he continued. 'It encourages you to go and do the work. It's to sharpen you up.' p.334

Professional dancer Amarnah Osajivbe-Amuludun at Steam Down:
> She's well placed to articulate the experience of moving to music with other people. 'It's a space for me to experience my body with others,' she tells me, 'and to connect to something that's more than just form and shape, which is what I normally think of when I'm performing as a professional dance.' Communal dancing spaces off her the opportunity to 'drop down out of my brain, into my heart, into my stomach. To let the vibrations affect me and let me affect the vibrations.' p.341

> You might think it's not that deep, it's just dancing. You can think what you like, but I believe that moving to music is an effective way to see ourselves and each other, and to resynchronise and rebuild, regardless of what has been demolished -- hopes and dreams, an economy, the future. To dance you must let go of self-consciousness, embarrassment, pride and prejudice, and embrace what you actually have. The more we improvise movement, together, the better chance we have of thickening our relationships, building the necessary connections we need for a future that looks increasingly low-resource and local. Motion is tidal, flowing around obstacles like water round wood, wearing them down with repetition. It reshapes the environment and it reshapes us. We're all dancers, I think, regardless of where we come from or where we're going. We're dancers because we're human, and we're more human -- or perhaps more humane -- if we dance together, especially when we make it up on the spot. p.346
