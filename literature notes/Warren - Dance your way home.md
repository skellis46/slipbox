# Emma Warren - Dance your Way Home

_previous note:_

> Escapism has always been an adjective used to describe the dance. That's an outsider's view. Solidarity is what it really offers -- Theo Parrish [in @warren-2023-dance p.v]

Original facebook post: https://www.facebook.com/375955904675/posts/overwhelmed-i-wish-i-was-shocked-embarrassed-at-the-lack-of-overt-commentary-fro/10155045234804676/

> Ultimately it begins inside, to the low-frequency quartet of heartbeat, blood flow, digestive rumble and maternal voice. p.15

> Dance is unstoppable expression. Each gesture, flex, slide or shape we make in response to music contains communication and history. We absorb or reject each other's movement in order to signify that we're part of a community or to indicate that we're not. It shapes us, as we make shapes. Movement is bound to music, not separate from it. The Greek root of the word 'music' related to all the arts of the muses, and this included dancing. p.16

> When you're a great street dancer [in] the act of improvising to the music, you're outside of your body and you're inside your body. You're both places simultaneously. -- Tony Basil, in Warren p.18

- Martha Bayless, Folklore and Public Culture (Oregon) wrote a paper on The Fuller Brooch -- "engraving depicts dancing": <https://www.jstor.org/stable/26332316>

> It's a nonsense to talk about whole demographics as if they were one amorphous mass, but allow me a moment to make a very general observation: there's a contingent of people who'd describe themselves as English who are slightly embarrassed by dancing. The Anglo-centric awkwardness I'm talking about expresses itself in a number of ways: the need for drink or drugs as a precursor to movement; or a cloak of 'silliness' that allows for more flexibility. It's cultural.[@warren-2023-dance p.32]

> The community of practitioner-researchers attending the conference were attempting to illuminate the deep past. They have spent years, sometimes decades, trying to catch steps that only existed in the moment. These steps were enacted in bodies that moved according to freedoms and constraints we can only imagine, which perhaps make this archiving task as slippery as attempting to archive one family's laughter. I recognised the generosity: a desperate desire to ensure that precious and hard-won knowledge is passed on, either by writing it down or by demonstrating it so that others can carry the gestural information with them and, in turn, pass it on. p.36

> I have versions of Englishness that I believe in too, and which are visible on the dancefloor. [...] An England where we recognise the cultural riches that state action diverted to this small collection of islands off the coast of mainland Europe – and one in which we accept what this diversion cost. An England were ordinary dancing is valued, and not just because it indicates an understanding of who we are. p.38

> Traditional dances grow from ordinary steps, the kind people do at home with friends and family. Rules and regulations are imposed on a movement language in order to teach, perform and judge it. At this point, a dance becomes fixed – until the steps are enlivened by new use. Dance is a generous kind of virus that enters our bodies and changes itself as it changes us. Like a virus, it mutates, better to spread. p.39

> I'm purposefully steering away from ideas of dance as ritual, not least because Professor Theresa Buckland pointed out back in 2002 that the idea of dance sharing primitive origins with ritual practices 'emerged quite specifically from traditions of European thought during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries' – particularly what she describes as 'colonialist inequalities' – and that this idea has been 'soundly criticised' by anthropologists of dance and human movement. p.40

> Prominent, powerful people in the UK are disproportionately white and male, often coming from backgrounds that encompass the holy trinity of home ownership, historic land possession and expensive private education. p.43

> [Professor Maxine Leeds Craig] describes the way that a disturbing idea of 'natural awkwardness' emerged, and goes on to nail a powerful thought: 'White middle-class men are rarely reduced to their bodies and the price many of them pay for that privilege is dancefloor awkwardness.' I wonder if certain men and women in Britain, especially those who come from a demographic which once controlled many millions of bodies across the world, absorbed the idea that moving freely presents a risk to status and social standing. Stature through this lens sounds a lot like 'statue'. pp-44-45. 

> Something in the boundary between actor and person fell apart as I watched that scene [in _The Best Man_]. The actors are smiling because they're dancing, no longer the 'uptight college friend' or 'long-suffering girlfriend' or 'womaniser who finds the errors of his ways through prayer'. They're people engaged in the joyful feeling of moving together and seeing their neighbour add a little flourish or a gesture-as-joke. p.50

> Dance is an absorbent medium, shifting and expanding in response to what's in the cultural ether, whether that's Flann O'Brien's cheap dance or a diasporic céilí. Migration is movement in the most literal sense. p.70

> Music is vibrational instruction, and the information contained in a bassline – 'Move! Pause!' – became unavoidable under these circumstances. I felt this in environments that were built, decades later, on reggae's sound-system foundations, like mid-1990s jungle or drum 'n' bass nights, or in the dubstep dances of the mid-2000s. It's impossible not to move, and to feel, when the music is powered in this way. p.88

> [William H. McNeill in _Keeping Together in Time: Dance and Drill in Human History_] believed that moving to music created human-sized communities and, must later, sustained them once settlements developed into cities and – as cities do – began attracting individuals and families from diverse locations. 
> Dancing, perhaps, is the mother of the most basic human invention: humanity. p.112

> Youth clubs suffered the erasure that often happens to culture made by and for people who are young, are of Global Majority ethnicity, are queer or poor or otherwise marginalised. Our society fetishises youth, but we don't appear to like young people very much, and we don't seem very interested in respecting or appreciating these grass-roots conservatoires – or even seeing them. p.117

> It's worth pausing here, briefly, just to remind ourselves again of the fundamental role of the dancer in music culture. To give just one example, consider the way hip hop developed in the late seventies after Jamaican-born DJ Kool Here noticed that dancers responded particularly well to the instrumental sections of old soul records. The idea of mixing between two tracks on two turntables occurred in order to extend the break and to give the dancers more of what they were requesting with their feet and outstretched arms. p.125

> All DJs know that the crowd sometimes likes to move to a familiar tune, like the way a wedding DJ will drop an intergenerational banger – Sweet Female Attitude's 'Flowers' or 'The Twist' by Chubby Checker – and that this can unleash a certain kind of happiness that comes from recognition and moving to music that contains layers of lived experience. p.131

> I have a fragment of a memory from my own school discos: of dancing on the margins, by the canteen shutters, where I might have done some high kicks. A boy – let's call him Gerard – who was tall, and who later got suspended for setting the soles of his shoes on fire, pointed and laughed at me. I stopping doing high kicks, immediately and for ever. Dancing can release and repair, but it can also contain a person within the invisible walls of shame. I was ashamed at having danced wrong, for having confused my love of gymnastics with how to behave at a school disco. It's a reminder that almost anyone can be shamed into stillness and that a snide comment can put someone off for life. p.138
