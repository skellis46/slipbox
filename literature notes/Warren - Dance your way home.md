# Emma Warren - Dance your Way Home

_previous note:_

> Escapism has always been an adjective used to describe the dance. That's an outsider's view. Solidarity is what it really offers -- Theo Parrish [in @warren-2023-dance p.v]

> Ultimately it begins inside, to the low-frequency quartet of heartbeat, blood flow, digestive rumble and maternal voice. p.15

> Dance is unstoppable expression. Each gesture, flex, slide or shape we make in response to music contains communication and history. We absorb or reject each other's movement in order to signify that we're part of a community or to indicate that we're not. It shapes us, as we make shapes. Movement is bound to music, not separate from it. The Greek root of the word 'music' related to all the arts of the muses, and this included dancing. p.16

> When you're a great street dancer [in] the act of improvising to the music, you're outside of your body and you're inside your body. You're both places simultaneously. -- Tony Basil, in Warren p.18
