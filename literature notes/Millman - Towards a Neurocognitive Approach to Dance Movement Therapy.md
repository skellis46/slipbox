# Millman - Towards a Neurocognitive Approach to Dance Movement Therapy for Mental Health: A Systematic Review

_previous note:_ [[]]


> Existing clinical research does not control well for unspecific effects of exercise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6x6hbvf3zdvzzgm8gaspwx4))


> Dance movement therapy (DMT) has been defined by the American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) as ‘the psychotherapeutic use of movement to promote emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual, for the purpose of improving health and well-being’ ("What is dance/movement therapy?," [2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0118)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6x6kb1srfdyx5n57q5yzdnw))


> Cruz ([2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0020)) argues that action, observation and sensations of one's own body are at the centre of education and clinical practice of DMT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6x6kfx13hmaq8q1wfdf2xre))


> (2) *increasing awareness of the body*: becoming more aware of micromovements that occur in regular tasks, working with the idea that sensations in the body may be the initial form of our emotions; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xe1dj1417ecaqw3bet1aa5))


+++++ 
- Note: This is a type of DMT


> Another technique often used within DMT is *Authentic Movement* (Whitehouse, [1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0119)), involving one individual as a ‘mover’ and another as an external ‘witness’, with the hypothesized mode of action being the release of unconscious feelings by the mover and becoming a witness of oneself. It is claimed that this can be achieved through attention to sensations, images and emotions, and then giving these a new form through movement, as well as through the development of a relationship between the mover and the witness. The witness encourages this inner listening and becoming of one's own witness under the assumption that ‘after being seen by another, one begins to see oneself’ (Musicant, [1994](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0082), p. 97). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xe3fzwp3n08nq8cdbmqznk))


> Dance uniquely combines social, cognitive and fitness components. As such, it is a potentially valuable intervention to prevent or treat physical and cognitive decline (Verghese et al., [2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0113)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xe709b4537v9k8wpzserpr))


> there remain many open questions regarding DMT. Importantly, the concepts and mechanisms by which DMT works often remain underspecified. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xeb58fk2ypb790dczw9pn7))


> A broad literature search was undertaken, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA Group, [2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0081)), examining research on group DMT or BPT in clinical mental health populations within the last 15 years. Searches were conducted using pre-decided search terms using PubMed, Science Direct, World of Science and Clinicaltrials.gov published between 2004 and August 2019. Search term combinations were as follows: (‘dance movement therapy’ OR ‘body psychotherapy’) AND (‘clinical trial’ OR ‘mental health’ OR ‘RCT’ OR ‘psychiatric’) AND/OR (‘depression’ OR ‘dissociation’ OR ‘depersonalization’ OR ‘schizophrenia’ OR ‘autism’ OR ‘trauma’ OR ‘eating disorder’ OR ‘OCD’ OR ‘anxiety’). After the removal of duplicates (2,437), paper titles and abstracts were screened by the first author (LSMM). Full text of the remaining papers was then reviewed to determine eligibility by LSMM. A flow diagram of the study screening process is presented in Figure [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-fig-0001).

+++++ 
- Note: highlighted this because of how clear it is describing what a systematic review is.


> Given the heterogeneity of included studies with regard to clinical conditions, age, outcome measures and interventions, a meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate. Instead, a narrative synthesis was conducted to describe, evaluate and summarize the findings and outcomes of the included studies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xekpveet1f8bpj4tjy2e23))


+++++ 
- Note: Highlighted this as thought it was clear rationale for a 'narrative synthesis'.


> Outcome measures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xet7wvvq0d5qa9g1qeazer))


+++++ 
- Note: the list of outcome measures is mind-boggling.


> BSE = Body Self-Efficacy Scale (Fuchs & Koch, [2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0033)); ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xey9gg0zgw7qe21gskmtkj))


> Cumulatively, these findings suggest that both DMT and BPT can have a positive impact on mental health, particularly in mood disorders. An outstanding issue is whether such results would be observed with other forms of exercise and to what extent the findings may depend on the client's previous dance experience. Surprisingly, potential benefits on bodily awareness (i.e., in somatoform disorder and imitation synchronization [ASD]) have only recently come into focus, despite being central to the conceptualization of DMT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xggg8nzndq5x1a45dr6emf))


> Expanding upon the need for more reliable and valid outcomes, the inclusion of physiological and/or more objective measures along with subjective self-report measures is crucial. To identify the psychological and brain mechanisms that may mediate DMT, it seems important to include behavioural, physiological and neural measures of embodiment and nonverbal communication. With the exception of the Jeong et al. ([2005](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0054)) study, which measured plasma serotonin and dopamine and the Koehne et al. ([2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0070)) study, which measured automatic imitation, interpersonal synchronization and an assessment of spontaneous interaction in movement, no other research explored in this review in the area of clinical mental health disorders (versus well-being in individuals with Parkinson's or dementia, e.g., Abraham et al., [2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0001); Ho et al., [2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0050)) involved any psychophysiological or neural measure. There is a need for more rigorous experimental methods including mixed-methods quantitative and objective physiological and neurophysiological data collection in combination with subjective self-reports. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xgqn2e4qt4ej4hb373cgjs))


> The current scope of research raises many outstanding questions regarding DMT. Importantly, the concepts and mechanisms by which DMT works remain rather opaque. For example, what are the specific mechanisms involved in expressing emotions through bodily movements, and how does this work to ameliorate particular symptoms? This is where cognitive neuroscience can help both in terms of clarifying the mechanisms of how DMT works (i.e., by enhancing bodily or interoceptive awareness) as well as what dysfunctional cognitive mechanisms are being addressed through DMT (i.e., mood in affective disorders and dissociation in depersonalization–derealization disorder [DDD]). An important step forward in relation to this would be examining embodiment/disembodiment from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xgr0zn55rsb7ch67w4z0md))


> Although these studies offer some positive outcomes and support for the use of DMT as a treatment tool, it is unclear *how* DMT achieves these results. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xgv55jdtdw51r1q9nsqg50))


> Goldman and de Vignemont ([2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0036), p. 154) have explored ideas of embodied social cognition and define embodiment as the ‘mental representations in bodily formats that have an important role in cognition’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xh3rzk0tgf576sjt9386s9))


> Proprioception, or an awareness of one's positioning of their body in space (Sherrington, [1907](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0103)), has also been shown to be modulated by dance expertise (Jola, Davis, & Haggard, [2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0055)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xhcxgh5pm48wtk7yp2tw36))


> An increased awareness of the body can also be seen in dancer's interoceptive accuracy (Christensen, Gaigg, & Calvo-Merino, [2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0015)). Interoceptive accuracy, or objective performance on tasks measuring bodily awareness/changes (Garfinkel, Seth, Barrett, Suzuki, & Critchley, [2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0035)), positively correlates with a range of traits including emotional sensitivity and empathy (Dunn et al., [2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0026); Fukushima, Terasawa, & Umeda, [2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0034); Herbert, Pollatos, Flor, Enck, & Schandry, [2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0047) in Christensen et al., [2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0015)). Interoceptive accuracy was compared between professional ballet dancers and a matched control group of nondancers using a heartbeat detection task, with results suggesting that dancers have superior interoceptive accuracy. Further, years of dance experience also covaried with interoceptive accuracy such that more senior dancers displayed the highest scores overall, followed by junior dancers and then controls. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6xhdxq65h70t4xz0004e105))


> Dance experience or expertise seems to modulate a range of cognitive-perceptual functions, and dancers can be considered to be experts in embodied cognition (Warburton et al., [2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0115)). Though DMT interventions are unlikely to generate expertise levels comparable with professional dancers, much research has shown that dance training changes behaviour and brain function within weeks and sometimes even days of practice (Cross, Kraemer, Hamilton, Kelley, & Grafton, [2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0019); Kirsch & Cross, [2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0063)). It is possible, then, that some of the benefits of DMT are mediated by the mechanisms described above and enhance bodily awareness. Continued research into and an understanding of embodiment in relation to dance and movement as well as how impaired or deficient embodiment can be targeted in disorders where this is a feature is important to future DMT research and treatment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zqnvfaej2bbxrjxjp3f2a5))


> Interoception refers to a sense of awareness of one's own body and its internal states (Tsakiris & De Preester, [2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0111)) yet surprisingly is not typically referenced in the context of DMT. This body-to-brain axis of signals originating from the internal body and visceral organs ties in heavily with ideas of and approaches to embodiment (Hindi, [2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0049)). There is mounting evidence for the role of heart-focused interoception in decision making, emotional experience and clinical disorders (Schulz, [2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0100)), and there is a consistent thread through neuroimaging research examining interoception and corresponding brain regions.

> Based on its positioning, the insula is able to process both top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors in relation to each other, comparing the two ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zrdergb1mtnwfe5pvsjs7e))


> Further, and one particular example, research by Sierra and David ([2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0104)), Stein and Simeon ([2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0109)), Seth ([2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0101)), and Medford ([2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0079)) has consistently found evidence for a crucial prefrontal–limbic interaction in DDD, a condition including feelings of unreality and disturbances to one's sense of self (Hunter, Salkovskis, & David, [2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0052)). In this case, hyperactivity of the prefrontal cortex is paired with suppression of the limbic structures, including the anterior insula, which is associated with decreased awareness of the internal signals of the body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zrhnt51c19k5qay5eg4kma))


> Herbert and Pollatos ([2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0046)) propose interoception as the fundamental feature of human embodiment and suggest that interoceptive states are building blocks that contribute to this fundament of the ‘self,’ where the self is grounded in the body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zrhxjfrwnsrsx1p4tyn8fb))


> central to the experience of emotion and affective states is, first, an internal awareness of the state of the body (Damasio & Carvalho, [2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0021)). Damasio and Carvalho ([2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpp.2490#cpp2490-bib-0021)) suggest that changes to the body will result in both automatic physiological responses and feelings, also described as ‘mental experiences of body states’ (p. 143). Any deviations from homeostasis are detected by the interoceptive system within the body, with descriptions of feelings then being in reference to one's internal state.
