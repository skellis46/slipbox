# Ginsburg - Body Image, Movement and Consciousness – Examples from a Somatic Practice in the Feldenkrais Method

_previous note:_ [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]

- uses Feldenkrais ATM as a way to understand embodied awareness and consciousness.
- author gives examples from his practice -- classic examples of healing and change 

> On the other hand I can develop my awareness in such a way that my experience of my acting is rich with knowing my self-orientation, my relation to space and gravity, my sense of timing, and I will stand elegantly and efficiently using a minimum of muscular effort. [@ginsburg-1999-body p.80]

- this quote useful for [[embodied intelligence project]] as a position or stance (self-orientation etc), but what is afforded by this framing or position?

> It is odd that we have made the activity of sentience into a noun. We say consciousness and not consciousing, implying that consciousness is a thing. Yet for other related activities we say we are sleeping or that we are dreaming. [@ginsburg-1999-body p.79]

> I am gradually making an inventory of some of the mundane activities of consciousing and deliberately leaving out such issues as symbolic thinking, subjective qualia, etc., that take attention away from the biological roots of what we put under the heading of consciousness. [@ginsburg-1999-body p.80]

> We do not usually study ourselves with this attention to what we experience. Nor do we consider the degree to which our activity results from the integration of so many different levels. On the contrary we tend to study the visual system as an isolated entity, or the behaviour of a subject in responding to a target stimulus. We do so because our analytical cognitive abilities are easy to use. We have organized cognitive systems available which, through complex organized entities such as language, symbolic pictorial representations, mathematics, we can [p.81] represent ideas as images, sentences, or mathematical equations. Such complex organizations make simplicity possible. [@ginsburg-1999-body pp.80-81]

> My professional experience is in the area of movement learning in relation to developing awareness using The Feldenkrais Method.[@ginsburg-1999-body p.81]

> What I propose is that the phenomenology of the Feldenkrais Method allows one to connect changes in the domain of inner experience with changes in the organization of outer behaviour. It thus provides a way to observe the correlations between the domain of phenomenology and the domain of external observation. [@ginsburg-1999-body p.81]

> All of those mentioned developed practices of embodied awareness. Such practices show a correlation between a phenomenology of awareness and the refining and reorganization of human skills and capabilities. [@ginsburg-1999-body p.81]

> For Sacks the experience had an aspect of revelation as he realized the profound connection between his self image and his functioning, a phenomenological connection completely ignored in his medical training.

> It is not just a question of sensation. Remember, he never lost touch sensation.

> The phenomenology of the body-image is a profound subject. Here the body- image is linked completely to the return of organized functioning.

> although we do not control the learning process directly, the activities of consciousing are essential to this level of learning in which perceptions and actions are interlinked and constructed.

> Consciousness can be eradicated in abstract thought, not in the lived world.

> Reductionism, one can conclude, is neither a pragmatic, nor effective approach to working with people at this level, nor to understanding the integrative aspects of the nervous system.

> We cannot have a separate understanding of the brain or consciousness without understanding experiencing, without accounting for the details of the phenomenology of lived experience.
