# Ginsburg - Body Image, Movement and Consciousness

_previous note:_ [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]

- see also automated highlights in Readwise
- uses Feldenkrais ATM as a way to understand embodied awareness and consciousness.
- author gives examples from his practice -- classic examples of healing and change 

> On the other hand I can develop my awareness in such a way that my experience of my acting is rich with knowing my self-orientation, my relation to space and gravity, my sense of timing, and I will stand elegantly and efficiently using a minimum of muscular effort. [@ginsburg-1999-body p.80]

- this quote useful for [[embodied intelligence project]] as a position or stance (self-orientation etc), but what is afforded by this framing or position?
