# Brincker - The Aesthetic Stance – On the Conditions and Consequences of Becoming a Beholder

_previous note:_


> artworks that claim to be something affords their beholder to appraise that exact claim" [@brincker-2015-aesthetic p.135]

Talking about Hollywood films versus art movies (or "unedited clips of natural scenes"):

> a recent study showed that typical Hollywood movies determines both gaze and broader brain response to a much larger degree than for example art movies or unedited clips of natural scenes.34 Hence, the systematically different affordances of the movie styles yielded rather different patterns of neurological response - and presumably experiences. Strong visual attractors seem to micro-manage brain involvement whereas more open aesthetic affordances offers room for personal involvement. Such empirical findings might in- form "high-art/entertainment" discussions and possible responsibilities of funding and promoting junk-imagery in public spaces.

The 34 reference is above (re Hollywood films): Hasson, U., Landesman, O., Knappmeyer, B., Vallines, I., Rubin, N., & Heeger, D. J. (2008). Neurocinematics: The neuroscience of film. Projections, 2(1), 1-26.

- the model on p.127 (by Leder) is pretty amazing. Here it is:
