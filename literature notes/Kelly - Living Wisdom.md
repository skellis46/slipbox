# Excellent Advice for Living Wisdom I Wish Id Known Earlier by Kevin Kelly

Learn how to learn 
from those you disagree with 
or even offend you. See if you can find 
the truth in what they believe.


While listening to someone you love 
keep asking them 
“Is there more?” 
until there is no more.


When you forgive others 
they may not notice 
but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something 
we do for others; 
it is a gift to ourselves.

**Note:** Midlifing


You don’t have to attend 
every argument you are invited to.


You can’t reason 
someone out of a notion 
that they didn’t reason themselves into.


Movement plus variety equals health.


A great way to understand yourself 
is to seriously reflect on everything 
you find irritating in others.


Whenever you have a choice between 
being right or being kind 
be kind. No exceptions. Don’t confuse kindness with weakness.


If you are the smartest person 
in the room, you are in the wrong room. Hang out with, and learn from 
people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people 
who will disagree with you.


Trust me: There is no “them.”


Expand your mind 
by thinking with your feet on a walk 
or with your hand in a notebook. Think outside your brain.


Shorten your to-do list 
by asking yourself 
“What is the worst that will happen 
if this does not get done?” Eliminate all but the disasters.


Separate the processes of creating 
from improving. You can’t write and edit 
or sculpt and polish 
or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be 
unleashed from judgment.


Keep showing up. 99% of success is just showing up. In fact, most success is just persistence.


Forgiveness is accepting 
the apology you will never get.


Be prepared: When you have 90% of a large project completed 
finishing the final details 
will take another 90%. Houses and films are famous 
for having two 90%s.


When crises strike 
don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.


It is not a compliment 
if it comes with a request.


Art is in 
what you leave out.


Rule of 7 in research: You can find out anything 
if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know 
ask them who you should ask next 
and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the seventh source 
you’ll almost always get your answer.


Experience is overrated. Most 
breakthrough accomplishments were done by 
people doing them for the first time. Therefore when hiring 
hire for aptitude and attitude 
and then train for skills.


Following your bliss 
is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know 
what you are passionate about. A better path for most youth is 
“master something.” Through mastery of one thing 
you’ll command a viewpoint 
to steadily find where your bliss is.


You are never too young 
to wonder 
“Why am I still doing this?” You need to have 
an excellent answer.


The main thing 
is to keep the main thing 
the main thing.


Outlaw the word “you” during domestic arguments.


Don’t let someone else’s urgency 
become your emergency. In fact, don’t be governed 
by the urgent of any sort. Focus on the important. The urgent is a tyrant. The important should be your king. Down with the tyranny of the urgent!


Don’t reserve you kindest praise 
for a person until their eulogy. Tell them while they are alive 
when it makes a difference to them 
Write it in a letter they can keep.


Superheroes and saints 
never make art. Only imperfect beings can make art 
because art begins in what is broken.


In 100 years 
a lot of what we take to be true now 
will be proved to be wrong, maybe even 
embarrassingly wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is 
“What might I be wrong about?” This is the only worry worth having.


Learn how to tie a bowline knot. Practice in the dark. With one hand. For the rest of your life you’ll use this knot 
more times than you would ever believe.


The greatest rewards 
come from working on something that 
nobody has words for. If you possibly can 
work where there are no names 
for what you do.


In all things—except love— start with the exit strategy. Prepare for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into 
than out of.


A multitude of bad ideas 
is necessary for one good idea.


Your best response to an insult is 
“You’re probably right.” Often they are.


If you can avoid seeking the approval of others 
your power is limitless.


Calm is contagious. Be calm to help others.


When someone tells you something is 
wrong, they’re usually right. When they tell you how to fix it 
they’re usually wrong.


You are only as young 
as the last time you changed your mind.


If you can’t tell what you desperately need 
it’s probably sleep.


Ignore what others may be thinking of you 
because they aren’t thinking of you.


Don’t worry how or where you begin. As long as you keep moving, your 
success will arrive far from where you start.


You’ll learn a lot more 
if you ask people 
“how are you sleeping?” instead of “how are you doing?”


Generally, say less than necessary.


The work on any worthy project is 
endless, infinite. You cannot limit the work 
so you must limit your hours. Your time, not the work 
is the only thing you can manage.


You can reduce the annoyance 
of someone’s stupid belief 
by increasing your understanding 
of why they believe it.


If your goal does not have a schedule, 
it is a dream.


Every person you meet 
knows an amazing lot about something 
you know virtually nothing about. It won’t be obvious 
and your job is to discover what it is.


Don’t ever work for someone 
you don’t want to become.


Figure out what time of day you are most 
productive and protect that time period.


If winning 
becomes too important in a game 
change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.


Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.


Whenever there is an argument between 
two sides 
find the third side.


The best work ethic 
requires a good rest ethic.


Spend as much time crafting the subject 
line of an email as the message itself 
because the subject line is often 
the only thing people read.


When you’re checking references for a job 
applicant, their employer may be prohibited 
from saying anything negative 
so leave or send a message that says 
“Get back to me if you highly recommend 
this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply, take that as a negative.


Don’t wait for the storm to pass; 
dance in the rain.


Make stuff that is good for people to have.


If you’re doing something 
that you are hiding from others 
it’s probably not good for you.


You can be whatever you want to be 
so be the person who ends meetings early.


A wise man said: Before you speak, let 
your words pass through three gates. At the first gate, ask yourself, “Is it true?” At the second gate ask, “Is it necessary?” At the third gate ask, “Is it kind?”


The only productive way to answer 
“What should I do now?” is to first tackle the question of 
“Who should I become?”


What you actually pay for something 
can be twice the listed price 
because the energy, time, and money needed 
to set it up, learn, maintain, repair it 
and then dispose of it when done 
all have their own cost. Not all prices appear on labels.


Art is whatever you can get away with.


When you are stuck 
explain your problem to others. Often simply laying out a problem 
will present a solution. Make “explaining the problem” part of your troubleshooting process.


Don’t compare your inside 
to someone else’s outside.


Don’t bother fighting the old 
just build the new.


When someone tells you 
about the peak year of human history 
the period of time when things were good 
before things went downhill 
it will always be the year 
when they were 10 years old— which is the peak of any human’s existence. Factor that into what they say.

If you repeated what you did today 
365 more times 
will you be where you want to be next year?


If your opinions on one subject 
can be predicted 
from your opinions on another 
you may be in the grip of an ideology. When you truly think for yourself 
your conclusions will not be predictable.


The stronger your beliefs, the stronger your reasons 
to question them regularly. Don’t simply believe everything 
you think you believe.


If you loan someone $20 
and you never see them again 
because they are avoiding paying you back 
that makes it worth $20.

The trick to making wise decisions 
is to evaluate your choices as if 
you were looking back 25 years from today. What would your future self think?


The real test of your character 
is not how you deal with adversity— although that will teach you much. The real test is how you deal with power. The only cure for power is humility 
and the admission that 
your power comes from luck. The small person believes they are superior; 
the superior person knows they are lucky.


Your golden ticket 
is being able to see things 
from other people’s point of view. This shift enables heartfelt empathy. It also allows you to persuade others 
and it is the key to great design. Mastering the view through the eyes of others 
will unlock so many doors.


If you think that something 
“goes without saying,” it is usually best for everyone 
if you just go ahead and say it.


Try hard 
to solicit constructive criticism early. You want to hear what’s not working 
as soon as possible. When it is finished 
you can’t improve it.


The best way to advise young people 
is to find out what they really want to do 
and then advise them to do it.


There is no perfection, only progress. Done is much better than perfect.


You choose to be lucky by believing that 
any setbacks are just temporary.


It is not hard to identify a thief: It is the one who believes 
that everybody steals.


As long as an idea stays in your head 
it is perfect. But perfect things are never real. Immediately put an idea down into words 
or in a sketch, or as a cardboard prototype. Now your idea is much closer to reality 
because it is imperfect.


First, always ask for what you want. Works in relationships, business, life.


Curiosity is fatal to certainty. The more curious you are 
the less certain you’ll be.


The purpose of listening 
is not to reply, 
but to hear what is not being said.


The greatest killer of happiness 
is comparison. If you must compare, 
compare yourself to you yesterday.


Being curious 
about another person’s view is the most 
powerful way to change their view.


If you want to go fast, go alone; 
if you want to go further, go together.


To write about something hard to explain 
write a detailed letter to a friend about why it is so 
hard to explain, and 
then remove the initial “Dear Friend” part 
and you’ll have a great first draft.


Embrace pronoia 
which is the opposite of paranoia. Choose to believe that 
the entire universe is conspiring 
behind your back 
to make you a success.


When you are stuck, make a long list of 
everything that cannot possibly work. On that list will be a seed that 
leads to a solution that will work.


See that old person taking forever in line? That is the future you. Have patience.


Your goal is to be able to say 
on the day before you die 
that you have fully become yourself.
