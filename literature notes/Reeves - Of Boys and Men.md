# Of Boys and Men Why the Modern Male Is Struggling, Why It Matters, and What to Do About It by Richard V. Reeves

We can hold two thoughts in our head at once. We can be passionate about women’s rights and compassionate toward vulnerable boys and men.


In part 4, I describe our political stalemate, showing how instead of rising to this challenge, politicians are making matters worse. The progressive Left dismisses legitimate concerns about boys and men and pathologizes masculinity (chapter 8). The populist Right weaponizes male dislocation and offers false promises (chapter 9).


“A man would never get the notion,” wrote Simone de Beauvoir, “of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male.”14 But that was in 1949. Now the peculiar situation of the human male requires urgent attention. We must help men adapt to the dramatic changes of recent decades without asking them to stop being men. We need a prosocial masculinity for a postfeminist world.15 And we need it soon.

Factfulness: Ten Reasons We’re Wrong about the World—and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling,


In Factfulness, he describes various biases, including the “straight line instinct,” an assumption that a historical trend line will continue unaltered into the future; the “negativity instinct,” which is a tendency to think things are likely getting worse; and the “gap instinct,” which is a “basic urge to divide things into two distinct groups, with nothing but an empty gap in between.”25 As Rosling puts it, “We love to dichotomize.”


“The family may be a myth,” writes Dench, “but it is a myth that works to make many men tolerably useful.”


The success of the women’s movement has not caused the precariousness of male social identity, but it has exposed it.


Men who are not providers, or at least do not see themselves as such, work less.


Someone with multiple sources of meaning and identity would be seen by a psychologist as having high “self-complexity.”


Right now, men have a narrower range of sources of meaning and identity, which makes them particularly vulnerable if any one of the sources is damaged. Men seem to take a bigger dent in their happiness, for example, if they lose their job.44 As well as being good for children, a stronger role for fathers would provide many men with a powerful extra source of meaning and purpose in their lives.


one striking study showed that a Black man without a criminal record is less likely to be hired than a similarly qualified white man with a criminal record. This is why reforms to “Ban the Box” (i.e., remove the requirement to declare a criminal record when applying for a job) do not seem to improve the chances of Black men being hired.41


“Policy-making is not a zero-sum game in which you have to choose between caring about female disadvantage or the socio-economic gap or male underachievement,” write Nick Hillman and Nicholas Robinson. “All three matter.”


Men are also much more likely to commit suicide than women. This is a worldwide, long-standing pattern. But the gender gap is widest in more advanced economies, where men are about three times more likely than women to take their own life.13 Suicide is now the biggest killer of British men under the age of 45.14 In the U.S., suicide rates have risen fastest among middle-aged men, but there has also been a big increase in recent decades among adolescent and younger men, as figure 5-1 shows. Suicide rates for women have increased too, from a much lower starting point, but remain well below those for men.15


In a study of suicides, Australian researcher Fiona Shand and her colleagues looked at the words or phrases that men who have attempted suicide most often used to describe themselves.17 At the top of the list were useless and worthless. The true cause of the male malaise, I believe, is not lack of labor force participation but cultural redundancy.


There is something of a paradox here. The women who have achieved the greatest degree of economic independence, with high levels of education and earning potential, are the ones who are now most likely to get married and stay married. I don’t think Gloria Steinem or anyone else thought that this was how things would unfold. Even she eventually got married, at the age of 66, explaining, “We are at an age when marriage can be chosen and not expected.”34


Life is very different for men with waning wages and truncated job prospects. Equality is easier for the affluent.


“A model of stable masculinity,” writes David Morgan, “would include a relatively high degree of congruence between public discourses about masculinity and the public and private practices of masculinity. For individual men, there would be a sense of ontological security.”39 This is not a great slogan. “What do we want? ontological security! When do we want it? Now!” But this is in fact exactly what many men are seeking; a more solid social anchor, more certainty about how to be in the world.


A 2021 report from the Survey Center on American Life identified a male “friendship recession,” with 15% of men saying they have no close friends, up from 3% in 1990.43 Unsurprisingly, these are also the men who are most likely to report feeling lonely.


I once heard a stand-up comedian in New York open his routine by describing himself as a “stay-at-home son,” and then riffing off that theme. Like most jokes, it was funny because it had the sharp edge of truth. Many of these men are the inhabitants of the place sociologist Michael Kimmel labels “guyland.”46 The failure to launch is not just a trope. It’s a fact. A tragicomic sketch from Saturday Night Live aired in November 2021, showing women taking their male partners to a “man park” in order to socialize with other men. “Which one’s yours?” asks one woman of another.


Men on their own tend to be men alone. “A guy needs somebody—to be near him,” says Crooks in John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men. “A guy goes nuts if he ain’t got nobody. . . . I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets sick.”50


“The longer the hikikomori remain apart from society, the more aware they become of their social failure,” says Maika Elan, who photographed many of them for a National Geographic story. “They lose whatever self-esteem and confidence they had, and the prospect of leaving home becomes ever more terrifying. Locking themselves in their room makes them feel ‘safe.’”53


Looked at from every angle, then, the pattern is clear. Economic and social disadvantage hurts boys more than girls. This is an extremely important fact, and one that has yet to receive nearly enough attention. The problems of men are not only fueling social and economic inequality but also being caused by it.


But where there is a difference by gender, it is almost always in favor of girls and women. The only real exception to this rule is vocationally oriented programs or institutions, which do seem to benefit men more than women, which is one reason why we need more of them.


First, while certain traits are more associated with one sex than the other, the distributions overlap, especially among adults. After using MRI scans to examine sex differences in a sample of over 5,000 people in the UK—the largest study of its kind to date—psychologist Stuart Ritchie and his coauthors conclude that “for every brain measure that showed even large sex differences, there was always overlap between males and females: even in the case of the large difference in total brain volume there was 48.1% sample overlap.”3 In other words, the differences are dimorphic—different but overlapping—rather than binary.


Most studies find the biggest differences are at the tails of these distributions, rather than for the majority of people. A large majority of the most aggressive people are male, but the differences in aggressiveness in the general population are much smaller.


Fifth, average differences between groups should not influence how we view individuals. That is what most people call stereotyping and economists call statistical discrimination. even if, on average, women are wired to be a little more nurturing (which they are), it does not mean that my son cannot be an excellent, caring, and empathetic teacher of young children (which he is).


It is important, then, to keep the role of biology in perspective, and to be careful to avoid potential misuse. There is always a danger of succumbing to the “naturalistic fallacy,” presuming that everything that is natural must necessarily be good. But nor is it helpful to deny or dismiss the reality of natural sex differences. “I want [my daughters and son] to understand that there are differences between the sexes that are not shaped by culture but are more fundamental, rooted in evolution and biology,” writes the anthropologist Melvin Konner, in Women After All. “I don’t want any of the four of them—or my hundreds of students a year, or any young people, or anyone at all—to live with the great disadvantage of missing that fact.”6


One result of the testosterone bath of male brains is a greater tendency toward physical aggression, not just in humans but in almost all primates and mammals. Human males are more physically aggressive in all cultures at all ages.12 Boys are five times more likely than girls to be frequently aggressive by the age of seventeen—seventeen months, that is.


Worldwide, men commit over 95% of homicides and the overwhelming majority of violent acts of other kinds, including sexual assault.15 But the relationship between testosterone, masculinity, and aggression is complex. For one thing, it looks as if testosterone does not directly trigger aggression but amplifies it.16 How far this amplification takes place depends a lot on the circumstances.


As Carole Hooven shows in her book Testosterone: The Story of the Hormone That Dominates and Divides Us, the innate tendency toward aggression in boys and men is real but not necessarily expressed. We are not slaves to our cells.


These sex differences are not the result of some cosmic accident. Humans are, as Desmond Morris put it, “risen apes, not fallen angels.”18 The traits that get passed on are the ones that have been reproductively effective. That is what sexual selection is all about. The optimal reproductive strategies have been different for men and for women, with long-run consequences for our psychology. Men, for example, have a greater appetite for risk. This is not a social construct. It can be identified in every known society throughout history,


men are much less likely than women to reproduce at all. In fact, we have twice as many female ancestors as male ones.21 This can take a minute to get your head around. After all, genetically speaking, everyone must have a mother and a father. But of course one man can father many children with many women, while others father none at all. This is exactly what has happened historically. Genghis Khan, a direct ancestor of 1 in 200 people today, is perhaps the most famous example.


Psychologist Roy Baumeister makes the point more bluntly: “To maximize reproduction, a culture needs all the wombs it can get, but a few penises can do the job. There is usually a penile surplus.”23


This is where risk comes in. Men who are in danger of becoming evolutionary duds will be willing to take serious risks in order to gain access to a mate, perhaps by committing a crime to get more resources, or fighting in a potentially lucrative war. even a 50/50 chance of success looks pretty good to a man who is otherwise unlikely to have any children at all. As a result, Henrich writes, “Men’s psychology shifts in ways that spark fiercer male–male competition.”


As Margaret Mead wrote, “It is essential that the tasks of the future should be so organized that as dying for one’s country becomes unfeasible, taking risks for that which is loved may still be possible.”


As Billy Crystal’s character says in the movie City Slickers, “Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place.”


Again, there is a good evolutionary reason for this difference. With a much higher chance of failing to father any children, men have had to be ready to take almost any opportunity for procreation. “Physically, men in their prime are hardwired to be in a state of near-perpetual readiness to couple with any female in their environment who is likely to be able to conceive and bear children,” writes Marianne Legato, director of the Foundation for Gender-Specific Medicine.30 That is why Legato and others see erectile health as a proxy for overall health in men.


More money flows through the sex trade than drugs and guns combined, according to a study of eight cities by the Urban Institute.34 The reality of the male sex drive means, whether we like it or not, that sex workers will always be with us.


The title of a comprehensive review undertaken for the UK’s office of the Children’s Commissioner summarized the situation well: “Basically . . . porn is everywhere.”37 Some women watch porn too of course, but much less than men.38


Again, it hardly needs adding that, for good or ill, culture hugely influences the expression of the driven sexuality of men. one of the most important things young men learn from their surrounding culture is how to express their sexual desire in an appropriate way. But greater male lust is a fact of life.


I hope to have convinced you now that while sex differences in biology are not determinative of behavior, they do matter, and that little good will come from denying it.


We are, as Roy Baumeister argues in The Cultural Animal, evolved for culture. “Human beings are shaped—first by their genes and then by their social environment,” he writes, “to live in culture.”54


There has been a strong movement to get more girls and women into STEM careers, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It has been pretty successful too; women now account for 27% of workers in these occupations, a big jump from the 8% share in 1970, though still of course a long way from parity.56 But should we expect to get to 50/50 gender parity in all these jobs? Probably not. On average, remember, men are more attracted to things, women to people.57 Even under conditions of perfect gender equality, more men than women will likely choose these career paths. Not because of sexism or socialization but because of real differences in preferences.


Armin Falk and Johannes Hermle studied sex differences in certain preferences, such as a willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust, across a range of countries. Sex differences were largest in richer and more gender-equal countries, with each having an independent effect. They conclude that “a more egalitarian distribution of material and social resources enables women and men to independently express gender-specific preferences.”59


But I think the Atlantic writer Olga Khazan gets it right: “The upshot of this research is neither especially feminist nor especially sad. It’s not that gender equality discourages girls from pursuing science. It’s that it allows them not to if they’re not interested.”61


Two points bear repeating here. First, average differences between groups should never influence the treatment of individuals. Even if somewhat fewer women than men are interested in a job in engineering, this is no justification for discrimination against any particular woman. Second, the distributions of these attributes still substantially overlap. In one major study of sex differences on the people-versus-things dimension, for example, almost half (47%) of the male and female distributions overlapped with the other.62


boys and men is intrinsically bad. Indiscriminately slapping the label of “toxic masculinity” onto this kind of behavior is a mistake. Rather than drawing boys into a dialogue about what lessons can be learned, it is much more likely to send them to the online manosphere where they will be reassured that they did nothing wrong, and that liberals are out to get them. Adolescent girls are after all capable of similar kinds of bullying and disrespect, often toward other girls, but it is not instantly cast as “toxic femininity.” This


This incident at our high school highlights the first of four major failings of the political Left on issues related to boys and men, which is a tendency to pathologize naturally occurring aspects of masculine identity, usually under the banner of toxic masculinity. The second progressive flaw is individualism; male problems are seen as the result of individual failings of one kind or another, rather than of structural challenges. Third is an unwillingness to acknowledge any biological basis for sex differences. Fourth is a fixed conviction that gender inequality can only run one way, that is, to the disadvantage of women.


Lacking any coherent or consistent definition, the phrase now refers to any male behavior that the user disapproves of, from the tragic to the trivial. It has been blamed, among other things, for mass shootings,10 gang violence,11 rape,12 online trolling,13 climate change,14 the financial crisis,15 Brexit,16 the election of Donald Trump,17 and an unwillingness to wear a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic.18 Lumping together terrorists and delinquents, it ultimately poisons the very idea of masculinity itself.


Interviewing dozens of adolescent boys and young men for her book Boys and Sex, Peggy orenstein always asked them what they liked about being a boy. She says most drew a blank. “That’s interesting,” one college sophomore told her. “I never really thought about that. You hear a lot more about what is wrong with guys.”19


“The toxic masculinity . . . framing alienates the majority of nonviolent, non-extreme men,” argues the feminist writer Helen Lewis, “and does little to address the grievances, or counteract the methods, that lure susceptible individuals toward the far right.”


“There’s a contradiction in a discourse that on the one hand claims that male privilege, entitlement and the patriarchy are the most powerful forces of oppression humanity has ever created,” writes the Guardian commentator Luke Turner, “and on the other would (understandably) like men to process this quickly, and without fuss.”


Men do not have a higher sex drive just because society valorizes male sexuality, even if it does. They have more testosterone. Likewise aggression. Remember, boys under the age of 2 are five times more likely to be aggressive than girls.39 This is surely not because 1-year-olds have picked up gender cues from around them.


Every 2 years, the World economic Forum (WEF) produces its Global Gender Gap Report. It is the most influential international study of progress toward gender equality, but like the White House strategy, it is distorted by asymmetric thinking. To compile the report, a gender equality score is calculated for each nation, between 0 (complete inequality) and 1 (complete equality).


As WEF’s number-crunchers explain, “The index assigns the same score to a country that has reached parity between women and men and one where women have surpassed men.” Across the fourteen measures, U.S. women are now doing as well or better than men on six.


But this is not just found in the U.S. It is an international phenomenon. Across the world, men have been more likely than women to support right-wing or protest parties.


In the U.S., a third of men of all political persuasions believe that they are discriminated against, and among Republicans, the number is rising.20 This is false. While the problems of boys and men are real, they are the result of structural changes in the economy and broader culture, and the failings of our education system, rather than of any deliberate discrimination. But on the political Right as on the Left, attitudes on gender issues float free of the facts.


Disenchanted men, following the Pied Piper of the internet search algorithm, can be led deeper and deeper into what has been labeled the “manosphere,” a world of pickup artists, incels, and even some male separatists—MGTOWs (Men Going Their Own Way). This is where men who have taken the red pill go to commiserate, organize, and generally hate on feminists. The term red pill, adopted from The Matrix, refers to a choice to see the world as it really is.


By contrast, MGTOWs don’t want to pick up women or harass them online. They want to get away from them altogether. One of the big fears stoked in this community is of a false rape accusation; better to stay away. There is a helpful hierarchy of MGTOWs, eerily similar to the levels you might find in a computer game. Once a man has taken the red pill and chosen the MGTOW route, the steps are to reject long-term relationships (level 1); disavow any sexual relationship or “go monk” (level 2); disconnect from the economy, making only enough to support themselves (level 3); and finally, completely disengage from society, or “go ghost” (level 4). Many young men dip their toes into some of these waters at some point.


Gilder saw the fragility of the male role. “Unlike a woman, a man has no civilized role or agenda inscribed in his body,” he wrote. “The man’s role in the family is thus reversible; the woman’s is unimpeachable and continues even if the man departs. . . . A man without a woman has a deep inner sense of dispensability.”39 Writing along similar lines, Geoff Dench identified the “fundamental weakness of feminist analysis” as a failure “to see that men may need the status of the main provider role to give them a sufficient reason to become fully involved, and stay involved, in the longer-term draggy business of family life.”40


The conservative claim is that feminism has upended the natural order of things, and we are all—but men, especially—paying the price. The restoration of traditional families and roles is the answer. This analysis is wrong. Feminism has upended patriarchy, a specific social order that had the fatal flaw of being grossly unequal. The resulting disruption is real and must be taken seriously. Men do need help. But we can help men without hindering women or trying to turn back the clock. Fatherhood in particular can be reinvented for a more egalitarian world.


Rather than helping boys and men in the difficult task of adapting to the new world of equality, conservatives encourage them to resist women’s progress. Resistance may feel good, at least for a while, better perhaps than the demanding task of adaptation. But it is also futile and pointless.


As Daniel Schwammenthal, director of the American Jewish Committee’s Transatlantic Institute, says, “The iron rule of politics is that if there are real problems in society and responsible parties don’t deal with them, the irresponsible parties will jump on them.”


“True equality between groups that are different in any way can be attained only by providing for the differences.” That’s Margaret Mead again, in 1974.1 Mead’s idea of true equality might now be labeled equity. When there are differences in starting conditions, treating people the same (i.e., equally) is not the same as treating them equitably.


As Gloria Steinem said in 1995, “The way we get divided into our false notions of masculine and feminine is what we see as children.”30


It ought to be a source of national shame that only 3% of pre-K and kindergarten teachers are men.41 There are now twice as many women flying U.S. military planes as there are men teaching kindergarten (as a share of the professions).


The singular focus on the traditional college route sends a strong signal that some skills are more valuable than others, specifically the ones that make you “college ready.” There is a lot I could say here about the classism and the “cult of smart” that underpins a lot of thinking and policy in this area.51 But one upshot has been a persistent undervaluing of vocational learning. This has been harmful in general, but especially for boys and men. on average, male students seem to do better with a more “hands on” and practical approach to learning and so benefit most from a more vocational approach.


The broader goal here is more of what philosopher Joseph Fishkin calls “opportunity pluralism.”55 Rather than a single narrow path in what he calls a “unitary opportunity structure,” there should be many different routes to success.


Community colleges also offer vocational courses leading to higher employment and earnings, especially those in health, business, and STEM. These colleges are also the most common postsecondary destination for young adults in the U.S. (By comparison, an associate’s degree in a liberal arts subject is not a great investment, in terms of labor market outcomes.)68


The new middle class jobs are in fields that are often labeled “pink collar” because they are overwhelmingly occupied by women.


In particular, the share of men in HEAL occupations—health, education, administration, and literacy—remains stubbornly low. “Women are always saying, ‘We can do anything that men can do,’” observed Gloria Steinem. “But men are not saying, ‘We can do anything that women can do.’”2 More men can certainly do HEAL jobs. And given the trends in the labor market, they must.


Florence Nightingale set the tone right from the beginning, when she effectively founded modern nursing in the nineteenth century, opposing men in the profession on the grounds that with their “hard and horny hands” they were not suited to “touch, bathe and dress wounded limbs, however gentle their hearts may be.”55


One study finds that adolescents close to their nonresident fathers do better than those with resident fathers with whom they are not close, as measured by higher self-esteem, delinquency rates, and mental health.25 There is no residency requirement for good fatherhood. The relationship is what matters.


But I now believe that if we are serious about expanding the role of fathers, equal leave is essential. The signal policymakers need to send is that paternal care matters as much as maternal care. Anything short of full equality blunts that message. I also believe that until and unless fathers begin to take more time out of the labor market, progress on closing the gender pay gap will be achingly slow.37


Doing more for boys and men does not require an abandonment of the ideal of gender equality. In fact, it is a natural extension of it. The problem with feminism, as a liberation movement, is not that it has “gone too far.” It is that it has not gone far enough. Women’s lives have been recast. Men’s lives have not. We need, as I said in the introduction, a positive vision of masculinity for a postfeminist world.
