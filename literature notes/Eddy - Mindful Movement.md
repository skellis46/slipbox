# Eddy - Mindful Movement
_previous note:_ [[soma is embodiment of a process]]

Eddy lists four theses in this book (which is really an edited collection):

1. Somatic awareness strengthens all movement practices and reduces injuries
2. Somatically informed mindfulness "underlies self-empowerment and critical thinking"[@eddy-2017-mindful p.5]
3. Engaging in somatic movement is "useful" in activism (p.5)
4. Mindfulness involving somatic awareness increases _connectedness_ ... "within a person, between people, and with the mysterious or unknown, and does so through neurological pathways often related to aesthetics."[@eddy-2017-mindful p.5]
