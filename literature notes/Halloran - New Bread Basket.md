# The New Bread Basket How the New Crop of Grain Growers, Plant Breeders, Millers, Maltsters, Bakers, Brewers, and Local Food... by Amy Halloran

Ghosts of wheat sit between these forgotten millstones and the bags of flour on a supermarket shelf. If we could see all these ghosts, understand the steps that led farming, milling, and baking out of sight and out of mind, would we be as dubious of wheat and gluten today?

Break down my pancake, or a loaf of bread from Wide Awake Bakery, and you’ll see the human glue that binds together farmers, millers, and bakers.


The sourdough starter that builds bread was under construction, too, sitting in a ceramic pot at the bakery. In other words, the toast I ate on an October morning was planted in September the year before.


The baker, the ingredients, and the fermentation process are in conversation. The baker has to be alert to where the dialogue, or dough, is going. And local flour requires a little more listening. Extra listening is essential when processes scale back from an industrial to a human level.


The farmer first has an exchange with the land, and then talks to the miller about what has grown. The miller in turn talks to the baker before the baker begins to chat with the dough.


Don Lewis was proving that local flour did work, and others were ready to get behind the idea of change. Dan Leader from Bread Alone had helped introduce European hearth-style baking to America. Matt Funicello from Rock Hill Bakehouse had used New York State flours in the early days of Champlain Valley Milling in the 1980s, and was eager to use them again.


Wheat grows in forty of the fifty states. More land in the world is planted to wheat than any other crop. On average, 20 percent of the world’s calories come from wheat; in some places wheat and bread account for a much greater portion of people’s diets. This was certainly the case in the past.


Brian Baker, an agricultural economist, continued the program and the thread of debunking idolized grains. His topic was dehulling, the removal of hulls from grain kernels. Spelt, emmer, and einkorn all require dehulling before we can eat them. The Romans, Brian said, gave up on ancient grains because of the extra work involved.


Wheat. Grain kernels that fall free from their hulls when harvested and threshed. A genetic triploid with three sets of chromosomes.


“Einkorn has gluten, emmer has gluten, and modern wheat has gluten,” Lisa said. But only common wheat, the one that is thousands of years old, not sixty, has the right ratio of high-molecular-weight glutenin, which is the biggest factor in making bread dough rise.


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is another umbrella-like title for a broad array of symptoms, some of which overlap with the symptoms of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. A staggering 14 percent of Americans have IBS.


The presence of vital wheat gluten in common foods is another concern. In the 1940s, this by-product surfaced as people were trying to isolate starch from grain. Inadvertently, the cheapest protein, cheaper than soy, cheaper than whey, was invented. The food industry has gobbled up this ingredient because it lends so much to processed foods, from protein and a pleasant mouthfeel to the more abstract quality of meatiness, something that makes products very satisfying to the tongue.


As our relationships with plants become few and far between, our misunderstandings about them increase. We want to impale gluten, the magical elastic substance that allowed us to invent bread. Bread allowed us to push our energies beyond a constant search for food, and into building civilization. In a functional sense, gluten holds bread together. In a metaphoric sense, gluten holds us together, inviting us to a series of rituals that still resonate, even as we’ve grown removed from their practice.


Yes, diagnoses of celiac disease are on the rise, and yes, people are finding relief from a range of symptoms by avoiding gluten. But I don’t think that turning our backs on a foundational crop, or putting ancient grains on a pedestal, are good long-term solutions.

Now the tasks of the milling equipment set the tone. This is a place to make flour. I wasn’t as giddy as I was that first time, but fresh flour is still novel enough to make people squeal, like the miller, Michael Scholz.


Michael showed the sifter, a box of blond wood that matched the mill. He told us how sifted flours are numbered for the percentage of the whole grain remaining after some bran is removed. Maine Grains makes flours that are whole wheat, and 86 percent and 75 percent extractions.


A key mentor in the project was Jim Amaral, baker and founder of Borealis Breads. He worked in the bake trials and helped farmers understand wheat from a baker’s perspective. He had pioneered access to local grains in the 1990s; his yen for local flour helped start Aurora Mills and Farm, a whole-grain mill in Aroostook County.


The pamphlet, published sometime between 1889 and 1909, was an ad for a new style and brand of flour, Pillsbury’s Best. I love how the writing and recipes address an audience that knows flour: PILLSBURY’S BEST BREAD To one quart of milk or water add one cake of compressed yeast; add flour to the thickness of batter, and let it rise over night; then add enough flour to knead softly twenty minutes, or until it will not cling to the board, as it requires more kneading than winter wheat flour; let it rise in the pan, then make it into small loaves, and let it rise again. Bake in a moderate oven, and do not let it stand in oven after the bread is done.


However, the most important part of a bakery’s readiness to use local flour is the baker’s own attitude or commitment.


Some bakers are more open than others to the differences that local flour presents. Peter Endriss is very ready to meet a flour at the bowl. I met his bread six months before I met him, at a tasting of regional flours. His rye, dark and dense, sweet and sour, sat in my brain like a gargoyle perched on a building. I made a note of his name, and followed his progress from selling at farmers markets in New York City to opening a restaurant, Runner & Stone, in Brooklyn. The bakery is a star part of the operation.


“I think the pre-fermentation of whole-grain flours is key to taming them,” he said. “Throwing a fistful of whole wheat flour into the dough is like throwing in a bunch of razors. If you pre-ferment, it just kind of softens everything rather than interrupts it.”


He wasn’t interested in running a retail bakery in New York; these operations generally rely on hefty wholesale accounts as well, to balance the budget. The profit margins on a retail bakery are too thin to stand alone. Pairing with a restaurant and bar means the bread doesn’t need to support as much overhead as it would in other sales venues.


All bakeries use recipes (formulas) and weigh ingredients. Smaller ones can be flexible to the whims of a living process, and accommodate variations in dough, whether caused by humidity, measuring differences, or inconsistencies in flour.


He noted that the higher hydrations possible with this kind of flour are an economic advantage. That hydration would prevent the bread from achieving a lot of volume, however. “I think that maybe people need to adjust their expectations of what bread should be,” he suggested. “Maybe bread shouldn’t always be super puffy, or have shapes that make the most beautiful supermarket sandwich.”


artisan have gotten so large that their processing is mechanized, which makes these types of doughs impossible to achieve. In this sense, size limits skills. Reskilling the workforce and training people for baking as a career, Peter said, is something that belongs in the conversation about changing flours.


Customers see that the bread doesn’t look like the bread from a week ago, so they get an understanding.


“The other thing I want to say is price. I don’t think we should negotiate with the farmers. I think it’s really, really important that we negotiate with the customers. That is our role, to say this is what it costs,” Trine said. Lots of people applauded.


Most eaters won’t notice the link between field and loaf—not now. But maybe in a decade, the public consciousness will have shifted and more people will be thinking backward, from baguette to bowl to mill, all the way back to the seeds.


Michael bought a combine on Craigslist, a little tow-behind All-Crop, the classic harvester coveted by people who are not going to grow many grains.


To Michael, the orchestration of flour, water, salt, and wild yeasts parallels the practice of making art. Both start with a vision and use materials to get to an end that is shared with an audience. Whether people are viewing art or eating bread, artists and bakers are connecting them to manifestations of ideas and labor. The materials act as a translator between people and things.


The pair made their first shared investment, a small Clipper air-screen cleaner, and again had Farmer Ground Flour mill some of the harvest.


Michael has a 20-inch Meadows mill, but has been too busy to set it up. The two want to mill at the farm or nearby.


The Michael O’Malley Mobile Oven, or MOMO, for short, is the nickname of the oven he built. He creates events that are part art installation and part social experiment—opportunities for people to walk that tightrope between nature and culture, art and life, and participate in something that has a lineage and heritage but feels brand new.


“In a highly mediated and controlled world, people are looking to exercise their agency in small ways. So having a garden, baking bread, making your own cheese, whatever it is, gives you this agency and sense of determination of who you are.”


Maybe thirty years from now, we will see small mills everywhere. Sounds optimistic and absurd, but I want flour to fit back inside our lives. That’s why I’m crazy about Grist & Toll.


In an episode of Adventures with Ruth, food writer and personality Ruth Reichl visits baker Richard Bertinet in Bath, England, and together they visit the miller who grinds the flour. The baker says what he’d like to make and the miller says what he’s milling, and the decision of what to bake is based on their exchange, which includes a discussion of the climate that day, and the kind of growing season the grain had.


While negotiating for a space, Nan taught herself to mill. She bought a set of 12-inch stones cut by Roger and Larry Jansen in Chico, California, and put it in her garage. Milling days, she worked in the driveway, experimenting with grains and grinding styles. Since she couldn’t use all she milled, and wanted more feedback than she could get in her own kitchen, she gave flour away to home bakers.


San Francisco’s bread all-star Josey Baker came to the mill with his new bread book. Jonathan Bethony from The Bread Lab at Washington State University brought his snappy, thoughtful take on sourdough. Don Guerra from Barrio Breads in Arizona left a buzz, too.


The glamour of heritage grains and the presumed badness of modern wheats is an even larger problem. This creates a dichotomy and hierarchy that makes the revolution she envisions impossible. A middle ground is necessary for all strata of consumers to have, as she described in a blog post, “superior flour, responsibly grown and milled locally, and have access to it more than once a week or once a month.”


“If you really want to build soil and put carbon back into the earth, you need to have your land in forages two to three years of the total six to seven in a rotation. Things have to go back to sod to heal,” he said. “Most of us have limited acreage to work with, and the temptation is to plow it up and plant it again next year.”


baker Jeffrey Hamelman. He runs the bakery at King Arthur Flour’s headquarters in Norwich, Vermont, and has written Bread: A Baker’s Book of Techniques and Recipes, a book so thorough that some say it is the only one a baker needs.

Behind him on a chalkboard someone had written a list of flavor notes: nuttiness, bran, bitter, sweet, fresh-bright, spice, grassy, hay, sour, straw.


Jonathan Bethony wears a beard and glasses, and has the sparky kind of mind that is great for chasing mysteries. He baked his way into this job, working in bakeries and training at the San Francisco Baking Institute. He won his spot at The Bread Lab over numerous bakers who vied for it. He is very well versed in the science of bread, and explains flour and sourdough with botanical and chemical detail, and beautiful metaphors.


“Sourdough is flour, water, and air. One gram of flour has 13,000 yeast cells,” he said. Yeasts feed on the starches in flour, forming sourdough cultures. Whole-grain flours have more minerals and more microbiological activity because of the yeasts that hang around the bran. Rye has more activity than wheat.


“Sourdough cultures have two major components, wild yeast and bacteria, or lactobacilli. Yeasts tend to colonize first,” he said. These competing forces create lactic and acetic acids. Certain sourdough flavors come from lactic acid and warm temperatures; colder temperatures favor acetic flavors and acidity. The microbiological population shifts over time from yeasts to bacteria, making a more sour starter.


“The enzymes unlock the food supply, which would normally be utilized by the plant as it grows. Those enzymes survive the milling process and enable similar processes to happen in baking,” he said.


“As bakers, it’s no longer enough to just think about a loaf,” he said. Bakers are expanding their thoughts and work, connecting with farmers and millers. “We’re each holding our place in the traditions. When we eat bread we absorb the labor of so many people.”


As long as cheap conventional commodities and less expensive organic staples exist, most of us don’t want to pay the true cost of food. We’ve grown used to food that doesn’t reflect the costs of production, some of which are hidden behind subsidies and futures trading.


The reception of regional grains is further narrowed by a battle between organic and local. In some cases, shoppers value regional farming over organic labels. For the mainstream consumer with a preference, organic trumps local, simply because it is more available and often cheaper.


The work and impact of the mill are not limited to Oregon. Camas mills teff for the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora in the Northwest, and fields requests for teff from around the country. Camas also mills barley flour, which is paired with teff in the making of injera, the flat bread served with traditional Ethiopian dishes. These buyers have an interest in chickpeas, too, which pleases Tom because it makes a good market for necessary crop rotations.


One farmer grows chickpeas while another is growing black beans and another is growing wheat. This is a complex and uncommon thing to engineer, but Hummingbird is used to working outside the bounds of tradition.


Tissa found Alan Scott, the oven builder whose designs launched microbakeries across America, when she was living in Petaluma, California, and on the lookout for good food. Once a week, she drove to get four loaves of his Desem, bread that was of such a different category, her kids called it by the baker’s name.


Alan Scott had a strong concept of what it meant to be a village baker. He insisted on fresh-milled flour, and direct-fired ovens of a certain size; limiting the size of the oven and fire would limit the amount of bread produced. Once a community needed more bread than the baker could manage, a new bakery should arise.


Tissa chose an Osttiroler mill, which was Alan’s recommendation, and picked out the type of mixer he liked, too. For the oven, she chose a next-generation model designed by bakers who had bumped into the ergonomic and economic constraints of the original Alan Scott design. In practice, village bakers have found they needed to make more bread.


The bakery doesn’t make a million kinds of bread, just a handful of standards and a daily special.


The other breads are platforms for the spelt, rye, Red Fife, and other grains to announce themselves.


Annie fit perfectly, because the team was forming around an idea, not around careers in food. Tissa, at sixty-four, was building the bakery with Corey Mast, who at twenty was already a solid baker. Their goal was to make a spot where the traditions of fresh milling, wood-fired baking, long fermentations, and wild yeast could coexist.


The Fife Boule speaks of other practical, radical thoughts, like Alan Scott’s ideal of the village baker. The taste is haunting and solid, and chases me like a ghost and a friend.


(A grain’s falling number measures how much germination has occurred in the field.)


Craft brewers restored the idea of individuals toiling to make beer by hand, yet they were forced to use the same ingredients as industry giants.


Commodity malt can sell for as little as thirty cents a pound. For a number of reasons, custom regional malts cost more. Small malthouses are aiming for unique products, and buying from farmers whose expenses are not insulated by commodity markets and subsidies. Lacking efficiencies of scale, craft malts can cost a dollar or two a pound.


One of the reasons so many growers stick with standard options and sell to commodity markets is because they exist, and have existed. Commodity markets might not pay much, but they will be there every year, ready to buy what farmers grow.


Blair Marvin and Andrew Heyn bake sourdough bread in a wood-fired brick oven, which is standard operating procedure for artisan bread.


Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, Elmore Mountain Bread is attached to Blair and Andrew’s house.


Alan Scott designed these ovens to fit the concept of a village bakery. The hearths could bake about 250 loaves, a manageable day’s work for a single baker. Once a community needed more bread, another baker and another oven would surface. However, making the figures work for this type of oven is tough, and bakers often move on to ovens with more efficiency and a larger capacity.


The style is an affordable alternative to Llopis ovens, a model many American bakeries import from Spain.


The overarching concept is to help farms meet a triple bottom line of social, economic, and environmental viability.


Unless I can summon a grains-obsessed billionaire to bankroll fleets of combines and rows of grain bins, and install mills on farms and in cities, change will come as it already has come—not wholesale, but in pieces.

HARD WHEATS: These are generally used for bread, because of their higher protein levels. The hardness refers to the quality of the endosperm.
