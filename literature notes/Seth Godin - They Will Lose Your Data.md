## Highlights

> The rules are pretty consistent:
>  • The easier it is to create and save a video or other file, the more likely it is to be lost or corrupted
>  • The more important the data is, the more likely it is you’ll notice when it gets lost
>  • The harder it is to replace, the more frustrating it will be
>  We’re all creators now. Podcasting, videoing, photographing, spreadsheeting… and we’re building a foundation of valuable data as we go. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw72yw5tz8rcq6hd796fv9wf))


> Forewarned should be sufficient. Assume that the software company doesn’t care nearly as much about your work, your memories or your reputation as you do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw72yqnv4c8rq2ma4b39mgja))
