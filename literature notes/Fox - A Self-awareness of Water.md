# Tim Fox - A Self-awareness of Water

_previous note:_ [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]

- quoting Jonathan Rose re ecological self:

> The root cause of the ecological issues we face arises from our definition of self. The ecological self is the ecology of the Earth. The perceptual boundary between us and the larger ecology is a mental construct. We need to transform this mental construct and function from the view of the whole, rather than the parts.

-- Joanthan F. P. Rose ('A Transformational Ecology' in _Moral Ground_), [in @fox-2022-selfawareness p.200]

- for above see [[a border is not a boundary]]
- holons from _The Practice of the Wild_ (Snyder), see also <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_%28philosophy%29>
- story as holonic emergent: "We humans, as an organism can only understand our place within the Holarchy (or anywhere) through [the story's] lens." (p.203) "Story itself is thus another definitive aspect of our identities." (p.203)
- flight as drawn-out and controlled fall (p.203)
- active engagement of healthy and happy memories of wild places become meaningful aspects of our identities. "... the more the land you live in lives in you, the more you are the land." [[du Cann - My body, the ancestor]]; [[compost for the future]]; [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]
- "What makes the continuum of bodies identifiable as a single organism is the consistency of the memories that pass through all the iterations." (p.205) (more on memory here)
- stories must be given into care of our "other selves" - the next generation (p.205)
