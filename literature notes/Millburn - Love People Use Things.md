# Millburn - Love People Use Things

> On a long enough timeline, everything becomes obsolete. A hundred years from now the world will be filled with new humans, and they will have long abandoned their USB cables, iPhones, and flat-screen televisions, letting go of the past to make room for the future. This means we must be careful with the new material possessions we bring into our lives today. And we must be equally careful when those things become obsolete, because a willingness to let go is one of life’s most mature virtues.[@millburn-2021-love n.pag.] ^315a65

> “The prime directive of the mind is to deceive itself,” claims the analytic philosopher Bernardo Kastrup, author of More Than Allegory. “Our reality is created by an extraordinarily subtle process of self-deception.”[@millburn-2021-love n.pag.]

- contrast this with [[the really real]], an unmediated encounter.

> You might refer to subjective truths—such as religion or food preferences—as beliefs or personal truths (as in the overused phrase “You have to live your truth!”). It’s impossible for these types of truths to be “false” because of their perspectival nature. After all, you wouldn’t tell someone their preference for vanilla ice cream was false.[@millburn-2021-love n.pag.]
