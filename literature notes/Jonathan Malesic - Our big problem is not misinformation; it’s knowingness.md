## Highlights

> **For the better part of a decade, scholars and writers** across the globe have lamented the growing prevalence of misinformation, [conspiracism](https://aeon.co/essays/the-intellectual-character-of-conspiracy-theorists), ideology, mistrust of experts, epistemic bubbles and [echo chambers](https://aeon.co/essays/why-its-as-hard-to-escape-an-echo-chamber-as-it-is-to-flee-a-cult). These scourges make it much harder to solve any problem of politics, climate, culture or public health, because they frustrate the search for a widely recognised truth. We know there is something wrong with the way we know. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd000vf77mbq81bjmxcz7k))


> Accounts of this crisis of knowledge, however, overlook how its differing elements arise from a common source. Our problem concerns not just the way we generate knowledge but our attitude toward knowledge, how we present ourselves to each other as knowers. Beneath the epistemological crisis is a deeper psychological one: the problem of knowingness. Knowingness, as the philosopher and psychoanalyst Jonathan Lear [defines](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674455344) it in *Open Minded* (1998), is a posture of always ‘already knowing’, of purporting to know the answers even before the question arises. When new facts come to light, the knowing person is unperturbed. You may be shocked, but they knew all along. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd00r2h2q1vbzbkcvj0w2e))


> In 21st-century culture, knowingness is rampant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd0zrtfvdz1981a7302p2q))


> Knowingness is a particular danger for people whose job is to inform us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd1je120hqejxx86e4vd9a))

> Oedipus’ fatal flaw is that he refuses to accept new information, because he always assumes he already knows what he needs to know ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd2cc4mjwj9r7s0htjbppa))


> In every case, as Lear puts it, ‘the stance of “already knowing” functions as a defence: if you already know, you do not need to find out.’ Knowingness, then, is a false claim to knowledge that makes it impossible to learn anything new. Knowingness is why present-day culture wars are so boring. No one is trying to find out anything. There is no common agreement about the facts, and yet everyone acts as if all matters of fact are already settled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd2v6dnfnf933nx3swhztf))


> Lear calls Oedipus ‘the first ersatz-philosopher’, like a fast-talking YouTuber who seems to have all the answers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd5ftsnmvah904yr81xc79))


> But, in fact, the information age reveals how *little* we each already know. Knowingness, then, might be a way to manage the flood of information. There is so much we *might* know, that we perhaps *ought* to know, that it’s often easiest just to act as if we do. And if everyone else is acting, too, then we’re never caught in our ignorance. Of course, then, we’re stuck living with these falsehoods and their consequences – from plague to political upheaval, the very matter of tragedy.

> Knowingness may be so tempting because it does serve a social function. The classicist Simon Goldhill [calls](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/508088) knowingness ‘the glue of social discourse’. Think of our common words of sympathy: ‘I know, I know what you mean.’ Claiming to already know someone’s pain is an attempt to make them feel more understood and, thus, less alone.

> **To overcome knowingness, we need a humbler and** more curious stance toward knowledge. This does not mean we should pretend to ignorance. And we don’t have to suspend all our knowledge when making a judgment about a new situation. It isn’t knowingness when a physician tells a patient that, no, in fact, herbal treatments will not cure their cancer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd96g447x5frcxhemwqypz))


> To combat knowingness, then, we should not discard either our well-established empirical knowledge or the theoretical orientations that help us make sense of new information. We should rather recognise the limits of what we know and be curious about what we don’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqd9kwpf0sjyxg6ckyybq23))


> Lear himself does not seem to have come to the culture with a diagnosis of knowingness already in mind. He listened to the cultural symptoms and made a proposal: here is what I think is going on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyqdadqaztkpj0vendsbra67))
