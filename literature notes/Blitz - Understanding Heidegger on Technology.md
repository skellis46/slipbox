# Blitz - Understanding Heidegger on Technology

> In his later writings on technology, which mainly concern us in this essay, Heidegger draws attention to technology's place in bringing about our decline by constricting our experience of things as they are. He argues that we now view nature, and increasingly human beings too, only technologically - that is, we see nature and people only as raw material for technical operations. Heidegger seeks to illuminate this phenomenon and to find a way of thinking by which we might be saved from its controlling power, to which, he believes, modern civilization both in the communist East and the democratic West has been shackled. We might escape this bondage, Heidegger argues, not by rejecting technology, but by perceiving its danger.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.63]

> The study of Heidegger is both dangerous and difficult—the way he is taught today threatens to obscure his thought's connection to his politics while at the same time transforming his work into fodder for the aimless curiosity of the academic industry. Heidegger would not be surprised to discover that he is now part of the problem that he meant to address. Bu if, as Heidegger hoped, his works are to help us understand the challenge technology presents, we must study him both carefully and cautiously—carefully, to appreciate the depth and complexity of his thought, an cautiously, in light of his association with the Nazis.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.67]

> Heidegger applies this understanding of experience in later writings that are focused explicitly on technology, where he goes beyond the traditional view of technology as machines and technical procedures. He instead tries to think through the essence of technology as a way in which we encounter entities generally, including nature, ourselves, and, indeed, everything. Heidegger's most influential work on technology is the lecture "The Question Concerning Technology," published in 1954, which was a revised version of part two of a four-part lecture series he delivered in Bremen in 1949 (his first public speaking appearance since the end of the war). These Bremen lectures have recently been translated into English, for the first time, by Andrew J. Mitchell. [@blitz-2014-understanding p.68]

## nearness, standing reserve and the technological

> Introducing the Bremen lectures, Heidegger observes that because of technology, "all distances in time and space are shrinking" and "yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance." The lectures set out to examine what this nearness is that remains absent and is "even warded off by the restless removal of distances." As we shall see, we have become almost incapable of experiencing this nearness, let alone understanding it, because all things increasingly present themselves to us as technological: we see them and treat them as what Heidegger calls a "standing reserve," supplies in a storeroom, as it were, pieces of inventory to be ordered and conscripted, assembled and disassembled, set up and set aside. Everything approaches us merely as a source of energy or as something we must organize. We treat even human capabilities as though they were only means for technological procedures, as when a worker becomes nothing but an instrument for production. Leaders and planners, along with the rest of us, are mere human resources to be arranged, rearranged, and disposed of. Each and every thing that presents itself technologically thereby loses its distinctive independence and form. We push aside, obscure, or simply cannot see, other possibilities.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.68]

> Of course, were there no way out of technological thinking, Heidegger's own standpoint, however sophisticated, would also be trapped within it. He attempts to show a way out - a way to think about technology that is not itself beholden to technology.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.69]

- this is really what I'm doing in #two_women_dancing -- I'm tripping into a way to think about technology that is beholden to it. Right? 

> The basic phenomenon that belongs together with being is truth, or "revealing," which is the phenomenon Heidegger brings forward in his discussion in "The Question Concerning Technology." Things can show or reveal themselves to us in different ways, and it is attention to this that will help us recognize that technology is itself one of these ways, but only one. Other kinds of revealing, and attention to the realm of truth and being as such, will allow us to "experience the technological within its own bounds."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.69]

> Heidegger claims that what is "horrifying" is not any of technology's particular harmful effects but "what transposes... all that is out of its previous essence" - that is to say, what is dangerous is that technology displaces beings from what they originally were, hindering our ability to experience them truly.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.70]

Blitz describes four points of Heidegger's critique:

> First, the essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. This means that technological things have their own novel kind of presence, endurance, and connections among parts and wholes. They have their own way of presenting themselves and the world in which they operate. The essence of technology is, for Heidegger, the best or most characteristic instance of technology, nor is it a nebulous generality, a form or idea. Rather, to consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and "requisitioning" of everything around us, and of ourselves.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

This idea of an event to which we belong is pretty powerful.

 

> The second point is that technology even holds sway over beings that we do not normally think of as technological, such as gods and history.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71] 

> Third, the essence of technology as Heidegger discusses it is primarily a matter of modern industrial technology. He is less concerned with the ancient and old tools and techniques that antedate modernity; the essence of technology is revealed in factories and industrial processes, not in hammers and plows.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71] 

>  And fourth, for Heidegger, technology is not simply the practical application of natural science. Instead, modern natural science can understand nature in the characteristically scientific manner only because nature has already, in advance, come to light as a set of calculable, orderable forces – that is to say, technologically.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

This last idea is very powerful. It seems to suggest the technological forces determine how it is that other things are seen (including things that we describe technologically). It's a loop. Recursion. Note also here in [[Turkle - The Empathy Diaries#^063b3f]], and that their dancing in that park with that phone is a form of recursion. We can only understand this event in this way because it has "come to light" technologically.  ^fa8c4f

> When Heidegger says that technology reveals things to us as "standing reserve," he means that everything is imposed upon or challenged" to be an orderly resource for technical application, which in we take as a resource for further use, and so on interminably.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71] [[Heidegger's standing reserve]]

> For example, we challenge land to yield coal, treating the land as nothing but a reserve. The coal is then stored, "on call, ready to deliver the sun's warmth that is stored in it," which is then "challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running." The factories are themselves challenged to produce tools "through which once again machines are set to work and maintained."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

> ... these acts [above re standing reserve] occur primarily by our own doing; we belong to the activity. Technological conscriptions of things occur in a sense prior to our actual technical use of [p.72] them, because things must be (and be seen as) already available resources in order for them to be used in this fashion. ... But these technical ends are never ends in themselves: "A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences." This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but instead, "only enters into its circuit," and is "regulating and securing" natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.[@blitz-2014-understanding pp.71-72]


> The isolated pieces, moreover, are uniform and exchangeable. We can replace one piece of standing reserve with another. By contrast, "My hand ... is not a piece of me. I myself am entirely in each gesture of the hand, every single time.[@blitz-2014-understanding p.72]

- these two women are instruments of technology, standing reserve. But they are also not exchangeable. Jacobs basically says this in [[Heidegger's standing reserve#^763ca9]] -- as

> Even the radio listener whom we are nowadays accustomed to thinking of as a free consumer of mass media—after all, he "is entirely free to turn the device on an off"—is actually still confined in the technological system of producing public opinion. "Indeed, he is only free in the sense that each time he must free himself from the coercive insistence of the public sphere that nevertheless ineluctably persists."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.72]

what is this technological system I am describing in this article of two women dancing? Not producing public opinion. More like the production of selves. The production of versions of selves. The production of the hope for virality. This is clasping at straws though. I don't know this. But it does raise the question of the extent to which we can ever know why or how it is that we make things. This is Heidegger's "revealing." ^05e7db

> But the essence of technology does not just affect things and people. It "attacks everything that is: Nature and history, humans, and divinities." When theologians on occasion cite the beauty of atomic physics or the subtleties of quantum mechanics as evidence for the existence of God, they have, Heidegger says, placed God "into the realm of the realm of the orderable."[p.72] God becomes technologized.[@blitz-2014-understanding pp.72-73]

This is the Gestell, or enframing (what translator of Bremen lectures called _positionality_!) I am in a mess here really. I am in a trap of Heidegger's making. See [[two women dancing#^29940f]]
