## Highlights

> The cerebral cortex appears to be divided into two corresponding systems: an “extrinsic” system composed of brain areas that respond more to external stimuli and tasks and an “intrinsic” system composed of brain areas that respond less to external stimuli and tasks. These two broad brain systems seem to compete with each other, such that their activity levels over time is usually anti-correlated, even when subjects are “at rest” and not performing any task.

> Anti-correlation between extrinsic vs. intrinsic systems was stronger during FA meditation and weaker during NDA meditation in comparison to ﬁxation (without mediation). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv2x17msjpqz3vj28t26qyv6)) [@josipovic-2012-influence p.1]


> These results suggest that the anti-correlation found between extrinsic and intrinsic systems is not an immutable property of brain organization and that practicing different forms of meditation can modulate this gross functional organization in profoundly different ways.

> An intriguing finding is that spontaneous activity over time in these broad systems tends to be anti-correlated even during rest and sleep, when no stimulus is being presented and no task is being performed (Fox et al., 2005; Fukunaga et al., 2006). The functional significance of this anti-correlation is not understood, but has been interpreted as evidence for an antagonistic or competitive relationship between these two cortical systems (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Fox et al., 2005; Raichle and Snyder, 2007).

> The specificity of these results strongly supports the conclusion that inter-area correlations between the intrinsic and extrinsic systems can be controlled voluntarily. The results add to the growing body of scientific evidence that mental states induced by different meditation practices correspond to measurably different states of brain activity.

> A highly speculative but intriguing idea is that the broad segregation of the cortex into extrinsic and intrinsic systems might somehow reﬂect the segregation of human awareness/consciousness into extrinsic and intrinsic experiences (Golland et al., 2008; Soddu et al., 2009). Asian contemplative philosophies, going back to at least fourth century CE (Conze, 1993), and perhaps much earlier (Radhakrishnan, 1995), have described the structuring of human experience along the subject-object dichotomy, accompanied by a competition between internally and externally related mental processes. We can all intuitively relate to the feeling of being lost in internal thoughts, when we become less aware of external stimuli. Alternatively, we have all experienced being entirely immersed/engaged in an external task (e.g., watching a movie, writing a paper) during which we completely forget about everything else.

> Furthermore, the results support the intuitive, but speculative, idea that the typical anti-correlation between the extrinsic and intrinsic systems might reflect the duality of extrinsic and intrinsic experiences, and that NDA meditation enables an atypical state of mind in which extrinsic and intrinsic experiences are increasingly synergistic rather than competing.

> For the purpose of cognitive neuroscience research, different meditation techniques have been classiﬁed into three broad categories: focused attention (FA), mindfulness or open monitoring (OM), and non-dual awareness (NDA) (Jha et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2007, 2008; Austin, 2009; Josipovic, 2010; Travis and Shear, 2010).

> Our results lend further evidence to the claims that NDA meditations are different from both FA and OM meditations. While FA and OM meditations are traditionally regarded as “constructed” states created through deployment of specific attentional strategies, NDA meditations are thought not to involve intentional effort, but to be based on identifying a reflexive awareness that is regarded as “unconstructed” (Mipam and Hopkins, 2006). Additionally, both FA and OM meditations are content-oriented, concerned with the specifics of experience, while NDA meditations could be seen as primarily context-oriented, concerned with the context of experience.

> The specificity of our results for the type of meditation strongly supports the conclusion that the anti-correlation between the activity of the extrinsic and intrinsic systems can be modulated in either direction through the choice of a cognitive strategy.

> It is tempting to speculate that practicing a meditation that either focuses on, or monitors, external or internal experience (FA and OM), actively increases the competition between extrinsic and intrinsic systems, while practicing a meditation that cultivates awareness in which external and internal experience is integrated (NDA) decreases this competition.

> Perhaps the biggest challenge in studying the effects of meditation on cortical function is that it is very difficult to objectively determine how and to what extent each participant is meditating (Varela, 1996; Lutz and Thompson, 2003).
