# Postman - Technopoly

_previous note:_ [[Postman's technopoly]]
 
> First, technology is a friend. It makes life easier, cleaner, and longer. Can anyone ask more of a friend? Second, because of its lengthy, intimate, and inevitable relationship with culture, technology does not invite a close examination of its own consequences. It is the kind of friend that asks for trust and obedience, which most people are inclined to give because its gifts are truly bountiful. But, of course, there is a dark side to this friend. Its gifts are not without a heavy cost. Stated in the most dramatic terms, the accusation can be made that the uncontrolled growth of technology de- stroys the vital sources of our humanity. It creates a culture without a moral foundation. It undermines certain mental pro- cesses and social relations that make human life worth living. Technology, in sum, is both friend and enemy.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.vii]

> Every technology is both a burden and a blessing; not either-or, but this-and- that.[@postman-1993-technopoly pp.4-5]

> once a technology is admitted, it plays out its hand; it does what it is designed to do. Our task is to understand what that design isâ€”that is to say, when we admit a new technology to the culture, we must do so with our eyes wide open.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.7] 

> New things require new words. But new things also modify old words, words that have deep-rooted meanings.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.8]  ... 

>Such changes occur quickly, surely, and, in a sense, silently.[p.8]

- in a sense what we understand screendance to be (already in such a state of flux) is now different. It's not a deep-rooted word, but it is changed by this new word TikTok, smartphone, social media, etc. 

> For example, to whom will the technology give greater power and freedom? And whose power and freedom will be reduced by it? [p.11]

> embedded in every tool is an ideological bias, a predisposition to construct the world as one thing rather than another, to value one thing over another, to amplify one sense or skill or attitude more loudly than another.[p.13]

This is what is going on in two women dancing for sure. 

>"The mechanical clock," as Lewis Mumford wrote, "made possible the idea of regular production, regular working hours and a standardized product." In short, without the clock, capitalism would have been quite impossible.4 The paradox, the surprise, and the wonder are that the clock was invented by men who wanted to devote themselves more rigorously to God; it ended as the technology of greatest use to men who wished to devote themselves to the accumulation of money. In the eternal struggle between God and Mammon, the clock quite unpredictably favored the latter.[p.15]



> Something else reached a mass audience as well: political and religious freedom. It would be an inadmissible simplification to claim that the Age of Enlightenment originated solely because of the emerging importance of technology in the eighteenth century, but it is quite clear that the great stress placed on [p.45] individuality in the economic sphere had an irresistible resonance in the political sphere.[@postman-1993-technopoly pp.44-45]

> With the rise of Technopoly, one of those thought-worlds disappears. Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World. It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. And it does so by redefining what we mean by religion, by art, by family, by politics, by history, by truth, by privacy, by intelligence, so that our definitions fit its new requirements. Technopoly, in other words, is totalitarian technocracy.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.48]

> That is crucial, because it led to the idea that technique of any kind can do our thinking for us, which is among the basic principles of Technopoly.[@postman-1993-technopoly p.52]

> Technopoly is a state of culture. It is also a state of mind. It consists in the deification of technology, which means that the culture seeks its authorization in technology, finds its satisfactions in technology, and takes its orders from technology[@postman-1993-technopoly p.71]
