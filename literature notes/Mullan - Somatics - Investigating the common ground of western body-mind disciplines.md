#  Mullan - Somatics: Investigating the common ground of western body-mind disciplines

_previous note:_ [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

This is a review article that summarises somatic theory including principles of somatic work (rather than differentiating different somatic systems and practices), its relationship to body psychotherapy and dance, historical roots of mind-body methods.

Mullan covers a lot of ground and the article is potentially a useful index or way-in to understanding the principles and history of somatic practices.
