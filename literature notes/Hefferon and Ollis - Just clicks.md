# Hefferon and Ollis - ‘Just clicks’: an interpretive phenomenological analysis of professional dancers’ experience of flow

_previous note:_ [[flow]]

_summary from chatGPT: _

> The article investigates the psychological state of flow in professional dancers using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). It involved nine professional dancers from various forms, identifying three main themes aligned with Csikszentmihalyi’s model of flow: the autotelic experience, challenge vs. skill balance, and absorption in the task. Dancers described flow as moments where everything "just clicks," characterized by enjoyment, intrinsic motivation, and complete absorption in dance, leading to loss of self-consciousness and time distortion. The research offers insights for choreographers, directors, and dancers to enhance flow experiences and suggests implications for dance education and performance enhancement.
