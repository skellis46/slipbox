_previous note:_ [[this body]]

- [[fear of being alone]]
- [[technological forces and recursion]]

> We are forever elsewhere. At class or at church or business meetings, we pay attention to what interests us and then when it doesn’t, we look to our devices to find something that does. ([Location 53](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=53))

> Without conversation, studies show that we are less empathic, less connected, less creative and fulfilled. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=204))

> To have both at the same time, they observe what some call the “rule of three”: When you are with a group at dinner you have to check that at least three people have their heads up from their phones before you give yourself permission to look down at your phone. So conversation proceeds—but with different people having their “heads up” at different times. ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=289))

> I call it the Goldilocks effect: We can’t get enough of each other if we can have each other at a digital distance—not too close, not too far, just right. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=319))

> When I ask, “What’s wrong with conversation?” answers are forthcoming. A young man in his senior year of high school makes things clear: “What’s wrong with conversation? I’ll tell you what’s wrong with conversation! It takes place in real time and you can’t control what you’re going to say.” ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=332))

> We slip into thinking that always being connected is going to make us less lonely. But we are at risk because it is actually the reverse: If we are unable to be alone, we will be more lonely. And if we don’t teach our children to be alone, they will only know how to be lonely. ([Location 350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=350))

> But it is often when we hesitate, or stutter, or fall silent, that we reveal ourselves most to each other. And to ourselves. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=354))

> Research tells us that being comfortable with our vulnerabilities is central to our happiness, our creativity, and even our productivity. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=368))

> Torn between our desire to express an authentic self and the pressure to show our best selves online, it is not surprising that frequent use of social media leads to feelings of depression and social anxiety. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=371))


> Our mobile devices seem to grant three wishes, as though gifts from a benevolent genie: first, that we will always be heard; second, that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; and third, that we will never have to be alone. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=396))


> And the granting of these three wishes implies another reward: that we will never have to be bored. But in creative conversations, in conversations in which people get to really know each other, you usually have to tolerate a bit of boredom. People often struggle and stumble when they grapple with something new. Conversations of discovery tend to have long silences. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=398))


> What people say to each other when they are together is shaped by what their phones have taught them, and indeed by the simple fact that they have their phones with them. The presence of always-on and always-on-you technology—the brute fact of gadgets in the palm or on the table—changes the conversations we have when we talk in person.
