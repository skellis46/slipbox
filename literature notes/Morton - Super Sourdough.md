# James Morton - Super Sourdough: the Foolproof Guide to Making World-Class Bread at Home

_previous note:_ [[Vanessa Kimbell - Kimbell-2018-Sourdough]]

> As a general rule, if the weight of fat is less than 5% of the weight of flour, it can be added safely at the beginning. If it’s above this, it’s best to leave it until the end.

> I’ve recently switched to a scaled-down commercial mixer called Teddy, which deserves a mention. It’s made by a Danish company called Varimixer. The difference compared to other mixers is night and day, and it has converted me (on a day-to-day level) back to electric mixers after years of avoiding them.

> The key to excellent sourdough making is to balance this protein degradation with its concurrent formation during the dough’s fermentation.

> Rheology is the study of dough’s strength, or lack of it. I’ve touched on the key terms briefly before, but I’ve found a few home guides that delve deeply enough into this to practically show you how to manipulate dough for optimum results.

> You should check out the work of the charismatic John Letts, who has achieved amazing results by blending hundreds of varieties of ancient wheat and planting them together. The flour he makes, sold under the brand Lammas Fayre, is exceptional. There are plenty of his inspiring interviews online.

> Competition is important. Bugs work together to optimise their growth, and as they grow they use up the energy in the flour, and this leaves less of it for other bugs. Furthermore, they produce chemicals that are either directly toxic to competing bugs or send signals slowing their growth. This results in the phenomenon of competitive inhibition, which will lead to certain bugs (and usually it’s the same ones again and again) dominating nearly every single time.

> Bright pink, orange or reddish moulds tend to be the nastier ones, and might not be moulds at all, but rather bacteria. Pink examples are T. thermophilus (a cool, heat-tolerant organism), E. coli (some strains harmful, some not) and certain Lactobacillus strains. Starters are melting pots of interesting bugs, and you don’t know what’s going to happen when your fermentation settles down.
