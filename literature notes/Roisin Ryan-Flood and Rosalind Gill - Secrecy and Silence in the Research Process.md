> We used what I thought of as a critical vocabulary in writing a document: we took care not to produce a ‘happy diversity’ document in which diversity is imagined as what brings the organisation together through the proximity of bodies of different colours. We took care to describe whiteness as institutional; to reflect on inequalities and to give an account of racism as an ongoing set of practices that benefits some and harms others. I am undone. The Equality Challenge Unit that monitored the process for Higher Education ranks the document as ‘excellent’: the Vice-Chancellor interprets this ranking as a sign of being good at race equality; ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CX03SI6&location=358))

> Time and time I was told about the problem of diversity pride: and how racism becomes treated as something that bruises the ego of organisations. ([Location 373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00CX03SI6&location=373))
