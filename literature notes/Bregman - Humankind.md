# Bregman - Humankind: A Hopeful History

_previous note:_ [[words, promises and time]]

## PROLOGUE

## 1 A New Realism

> Something similar happens when we look one another in the eye, because humans have another weird feature: we have whites in our eyes. This unique trait lets us follow the direction of other people’s gazes. Every other primate, more than two hundred species in all, produces melanin that tints their eyes. Like poker players wearing shades, this obscures the direction of their gaze.
> But not humans. We’re open books; the object of our attention plain for all to see. Imagine how different human friendships and romance would be if we couldn’t look each other in the eye. How would we feel able to trust one another? Brian Hare suspects our unusual eyes are another product of human domestication. As we evolved to become more social, we also began revealing more about our inner thoughts and emotions.31

> This is a truth as old as the hills. Our distant ancestors knew the importance of the collective and rarely idolised individuals. Hunter-gatherers the world over, from the coldest tundras to the hottest deserts, believed that everything is connected. They saw themselves as a part of something much bigger, linked to all other animals, plants and Mother Earth. Perhaps they understood the human condition better than we do today.38

## 5.1

To understand that last point, you need to know something about prehistoric politics. Basically, our ancestors were allergic to inequality. Decisions were group affairs requiring long deliberation in which everybody got to have their say. ‘Nomadic foragers,’ established one American anthropologist on the basis of a formidable 339 fieldwork studies, ‘are universally – and all but obsessively – concerned with being free from the authority of others.’3


Power distinctions between people were – if nomads tolerated them at all – temporary and served a purpose. Leaders were more knowledgeable, or skilled, or charismatic. That is, they had the ability to get a given job done. Scientists refer to this as achievement-based inequality.

Göbekli Tepe (translated as ‘Potbelly Hill’) turns out to be the oldest temple in the world and an example of what scholars call a collective work event. Thousands of people contributed, and pilgrims came from far and wide to lend a hand. Upon its completion, there was a big celebration with a feast of roast gazelle (archaeologists found thousands of gazelle bones). Monuments like this one were not built to stroke some chieftain’s ego. Their purpose was to bring people together.18

## 8.4

In point of fact, Hannah Arendt was one of those rare philosophers who believe that most people, deep down, are decent.37 She argued that our need for love and friendship is more human than any inclination towards hate and violence. And when we do choose the path of evil, we feel compelled to hide behind lies and clichés that give us a semblance of virtue.
Eichmann was a prime example. He’d convinced himself he’d done a great deed, something historic for which he’d be admired by future generations. That didn’t make him a monster or a robot. It made him a joiner. Many years later, psychologists would reach the same conclusion about Milgram’s research: the shock experiments were not about obedience. They were about conformity.
It’s astonishing how far ahead of her time Hannah Arendt was when she made precisely the same observation.


Belief in humankind’s sinful nature also provides a tidy explanation for the existence of evil. When confronted with hatred or selfishness, you can tell yourself, ‘Oh, well, that’s just human nature.’ But if you believe that people are essentially good, you have to question why evil exists at all. It implies that engagement and resistance are worthwhile, and it imposes an obligation to act.

## 10.3

The thing is, human nature has another dimension. A few years after this first experiment, Hamlin and her team came up with a variation.21 This time, they offered infants a choice between Graham Crackers and green beans to establish which they preferred. Then they presented them with two puppets: one that liked the crackers, the other the beans. Once again, they observed which puppet the babies favoured.
Not surprisingly, the overwhelming majority gravitated towards the puppet that shared their own taste. More surprising was that this preference persisted even after the like-minded puppet was revealed to be mean-spirited and the other puppet nice. ‘What we find over and over again,’ said one of Hamlin’s colleagues, ‘is that babies will choose the individual who is actually mean [but similar to them] to the [nice] one who had the different opinion to themselves.’22

How depressing can you get?
Even before we learn to speak, we seem to have an aversion to the unfamiliar. Researchers at the Baby Lab have done dozens of experiments which furthermore show that babies don’t like unfamiliar faces, unknown smells, foreign languages, or strange accents. It’s as though we’re all born xenophobes.23

## 10.4

One thing is certain: a better world doesn’t start with more empathy. If anything, empathy makes us less forgiving, because the more we identify with victims, the more we generalise about our enemies.37 The bright spotlight we shine on our chosen few makes us blind to the perspective of our adversaries, because everybody else falls outside our view.38

This is the mechanism that puppy expert Brian Hare talked about – the mechanism that makes us both the friendliest and the cruellest species on the planet. The sad truth is that empathy and xenophobia go hand in hand. They’re two sides of the same coin.

## 10.5

Most of the time, wartime killing is something you do from far away. You could even describe the whole evolution of military technology as a process in which enemy lines have grown farther apart. From clubs and daggers to bows and arrows, and from muskets and cannon to bombs and grenades. Over the course of history, weaponry has got ever better at overcoming the central problem of all warfare: our fundamental aversion to violence. It’s practically impossible for us to kill someone while looking them in the eyes. Just as most of us would instantly go vegetarian if forced to butcher a cow, most soldiers become conscientious objectors when the enemy gets too close.

## 11.2

inequality aversion

In an analysis of forty-eight studies on hunter-gatherer societies, an American anthropologist determined that Machiavellianism has almost always been a recipe for disaster. To illustrate this, here are some traits that, according to this scientist, were needed to get you elected leader in prehistory. You had to be:
Generous
Brave
Wise
Charismatic
Fair
Impartial
Reliable
Tactful
Strong
Humble 21

## 12.2

Historians point out that if the Enlightenment gave us equality, it also invented racism. Eighteenth-century philosophers were the first to classify humans into disparate ‘races’. David Hume, for instance, wrote that he was ‘apt to suspect the negroes […] to be naturally inferior to the whites’. In France, Voltaire agreed: ‘If their understanding is not of a different nature from ours, it is at least greatly inferior.’ Such racist ideas became encoded in legislation and norms of conduct. Thomas Jefferson, who penned the immortal words ‘all men are created equal’ in the American Declaration of Independence, was a slave owner. He also said ‘Never yet could I find that a black had uttered a thought above the level of plain narration.’

# Part 4.1

In 1959, the BBC asked Russell what advice he would give future generations. He answered:
When you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only and solely at what are the facts.

But then, to quote Russell himself, ‘None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error.’ So if we aim to get as close as possible to the truth, we have to eschew certainty and question ourselves every step of the way. ‘The Will to Doubt’, Russell called this approach.

I went back to have a look at the interviews Jos de Blok has given. They soon had me grinning:
Interviewer: Is there anything you do to motivate yourself? Steve Jobs reportedly asked himself in the mirror each morning: What would I do if this were my last day?
Jos: I read his book too, and I don’t believe a word of it.1
Interviewer: Do you ever attend networking sessions?
Jos: At most of those things, nothing happens aside from everybody reaffirming everybody else’s opinions. That’s not for me.2
Interviewer: How do you motivate your employees?
Jos: I don’t. Seems patronizing.3
Interviewer: What’s your speck on the horizon, Jos – that distant goal that inspires you and your team?
Jos: I don’t have distant goals. Not all that inspired by specks.4

## 13.3

A British study recently found that a vast majority of the population (74 per cent) identify more closely with values such as helpfulness, honesty and justice than with wealth, status and power. But just about as large a share (78 per cent) think others are more self-interested than they really are.14

## 13.4

De Blok has a very different take on things. He sees his employees as intrinsically motivated professionals and experts on how their jobs ought to be done. ‘In my experience, managers tend to have very few ideas. They get their jobs because they fit into a system, because they follow orders. Not because they’re big visionaries. They take some “high-performance leadership” courses and suddenly think they’re a game changer, an innovator.’

De Blok sums up his philosophy like this: ‘It’s easy to make things hard, but hard to make them easy.’ The record clearly shows that managers prefer the complicated. ‘Because that makes your job more interesting,’ de Blok explains. ‘That lets you say: See, you need me to master that complexity.’
Could it be that’s also driving a big part of our so-called ‘knowledge economy’? That pedigree managers and consultants make simple things as complicated as possible so we will need them to steer us through all the complexity? Sometimes I secretly think this is the revenue model of not only Wall Street bankers but also postmodern philosophers peddling incomprehensible jargon. Both make simple things impossibly complex.
Jos de Blok does the opposite: he opts for simplicity.

All that time, Zobrist’s philosophy was dead simple. If you treat employees as if they are responsible and reliable, they will be. He even wrote a book about it, subtitled: L’entreprise qui croit que l’homme est bon. Translation: ‘The company that believes people are good.’

What’s more, no other species enjoys a childhood as long as Homo puppy. Play gives meaning to life, wrote the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga back in 1938. He christened us Homo ludens – ‘playing man’. Everything we call ‘culture’, said Huizinga, originates in play.14
Anthropologists suspect that for most of human history children were permitted to play as much as they pleased. Considerable though the differences between individual hunter-gatherer cultures may be, the culture of play looks very similar across the board.15 Most significant of all, say researchers, is the immense freedom afforded to youngsters. Since nomads rarely feel they can dictate child development, kids are allowed to play all day long, from early in the morning until late into the night.

## 14.4

Bullying is often regarded as a quirk of our nature; something that’s part and parcel of being a kid. Not so, say sociologists, who over the years have compiled extensive research on the places where bullying is endemic. They call these total institutions.31 Sociologist Erving Goffman, writing some fifty years ago, described them as follows:
• Everybody lives in the same place and is subject to a single authority.
• All activities are carried out together and everybody does the same tasks.
• Activities are rigidly scheduled, often from one hour to the next.
• There is a system of explicit, formal rules imposed by an authority.
Of course, the ultimate example is a prison, where bullying runs rampant. But total institutions show up in other places, too, such as nursing homes. The elderly, when penned together, can develop caste systems in which the biggest bullies claim the best seats and tables at Bingo time.32 One American expert on bullying even calls Bingo ‘the devil’s game’.33
And then there are schools. Bullying is by far the most pervasive at typical British boarding schools (the kind that inspired William Golding’s Lord of the Flies).34 And little wonder: these schools resemble nothing so much as prisons. You can’t leave, you have to earn a place in a rigid hierarchy, and there’s a strict division between pupils and staff. These competitive institutions are part and parcel of Britain’s upper-class establishment – many London politicians went to boarding school – but according to education scientists, they thwart our playful nature.35

# Part 5

non-complementary behaviour. Most of the time, as I mentioned earlier, we humans mirror each other. Someone gives you a compliment, you’re quick to return the favour. Somebody says something unpleasant, and you feel the urge to make a snide comeback. In earlier chapters we saw how powerful these positive and negative feedback loops can become in schools and companies and democracies.
