## Highlights

> In fact, the institutions of industrial society do just the opposite. As the power of machines increases, the role of persons more and more decreases to that of mere consumers. 
>  Individuals need tools to move and to dwell. They need remedies for their diseases and means to communicate with one another. People cannot make all these things for themselves. They depend on being supplied with objects and services which vary from culture to culture. Some people depend on the supply of food and others on the supply of ball bearings.

> I choose the term “conviviality” to designate the opposite of industrial productivity. I intend it to mean autonomous and creative intercourse among persons, and the intercourse of persons with their environment; and this in contrast with the conditioned response of persons to the demands made upon them by others, and by a man-made environment. I consider conviviality to be individual freedom realized in personal interdependence and, as such, an intrinsic ethical value. I believe that, in any society, as conviviality is reduced below a certain level, no amount of industrial productivity can effectively satisfy the needs it creates among society’s members.

> Present institutional purposes, which hallow industrial productivity at the expense of convivial effectiveness, are a major factor in the amorphousness and meaninglessness that plague contemporary society. The increasing demand for products has come to define society’s process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsjzah07a5e2fz9hpt1pc6h7))

> The individual’s autonomy is intolerably reduced by a society that defines the maximum satisfaction of the maximum number as the largest consumption of industrial goods. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsjzct82h5re1qmqt4ewgkbe))


> New politics would aim principally to exclude the design of artifacts and rules that are obstacles to the exercise of this personal freedom. Such politics would limit the scope of tools as demanded by the protection of three values: survival, justice, and self-defined work. I take these values to be fundamental to any convivial society, however different one such society might be from another in practice, institutions, or rationale.

> A postindustrial society must and can be so constructed that no one person’s ability to express him or herself in work will require as a condition the enforced labour or the enforced learning or the enforced consumption of another.

> In an age of scientific technology, the convivial structure of tools is a necessity for survival in full justice which is both distributive and participatory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsjzgvbvt9f3y8t47ar5p17b))
