# The Bread Builders Hearth Loaves and Masonry Ovens by Alan Scott

> There is such a growing need to encourage the family and community baker/ nurturer, that rather than delay the process any further with lectures on whole grain to unwilling ears (good advice thrust down unwilling throats), I have endorsed the course that this book has taken, including some concessions toward commercial flours.

> Each time I open the oven door and I see and smell the loaves, my heart jumps and swells a little.

> And taste? This supermarket bread taste is vapid, neutral. There is not really a taste of wheat, and only a little of caramel (unless caramel was added to the dough, as in commercial “wheat” bread). No taste of acid— mostly the taste is of sugar, and of yeast: it would be nearly the same if a paste of flour and water had just been boiled.

> If I have any doubt about whether the loaves are fully baked (because they baked too quickly, or too slowly, or didn’t brown well, or they sound a little dull when tapped on the base), I check the internal temperature of a few loaves with an instant-read electronic thermometer with a stainless steel stem. Loaves have to be at least 195 degrees Fahrenheit, all the way through (and should be less than 205 degrees).

> Alan could have given up the baking a long time ago, and focused on his oven-building business. He hasn’t, because baking and delivering bread gives him something his other business doesn’t always provide—continuity and a sense of role and place. Actually, that kind of connection is one great reason for anyone to start a baking business with a wood-burning oven.

> Woodcutting is simplified, as they realized long ago that the cheapest and easiest source is sawmill slabs. These are an inexpensive, convenient, and ecologically appropriate waste product of local industry.

> Baking fermented grain, though, making bread: this is the way to make grain palatable and nutritionally available. We have been doing it for thousands of years with a variety of grains, ferments, and baking techniques across cultures, continents, and centuries.

> According to Christian Petersen, an English bakery of the middle of the last century used about two hundred and eighty pounds of flour a day to make three hundred and fifty pounds of bread. This served a community of four to six hundred people; village bakeries throughout Europe were the same size, and interestingly, that is the same amount of bread Jules and his wife Helen make today.

> The first and greatest determinant of the nature of flour is the nature of the grain it is milled from. When the stalks reach the right moisture content they are cut and the seed kernels are beaten off the stalk, or threshed. Threshing also knocks off the seed husk (which is then called chaff) in most strains of wheat. Modern cutting and threshing are a combined operation and the machine that does it is called a combine. Standing wheat is mowed down and a stream of grain free of chaff pours out.


> This process creates whole wheat flour, which can then be bolted (sifted) to become stone-ground white flour: the finer the sieve, the whiter the product. The wheat germ, the oily part of the seed that would have become the growing plant, is pulverized in stone milling. Even if it is later separated out by sifting, enough will remain to leave little golden spots of germ in the white flour that results. Thus stone-ground white flour is more perishable than the more common rollermilled white flour, because oxidizing germ oil becomes rancid and bitter.


> Millers and bakers have long known that fresh flour is harder to work than aged flour. Fresh flour tends to make a dough that is “bucky”—too springy and elastic to knead and shape, and reluctant to rise.


> Oxidation reduces the number of thiol groups on flour proteins, very sticky areas that would otherwise interact adversely with the gluten-forming proteins, leading to bucky dough. These chemical groups can short-circuit the process that causes gluten to pull back into shape when it has been stretched. An excess of thiols can decrease wheat dough’s great advantage over other kinds of dough— elasticity with extensibility — though the importance of this decrease is much less pronounced when dough is hand kneaded and slowly fermented.


> Flour proteins oxidize passively as flour is stored, which is how unbleached flour gets oxidized enough to be “good” for baking lofty loaves of bread. Commercially milled unbleached flour is therefore usually stored for three to eight weeks before it is used. This storage process is called sweating.


> For aged whole wheat flour there is a delicate balance between (favorable) oxidation of the gluten and excess (unfavorable) oxidation of wheat germ oils, or rancidity.


> The structure of a cooled loaf of baked bread comes from its gelatinized starch, whether the bread is made from wheat, from rye, or from a mixture of the two. This gel forms when starch is heated to a critical temperature in the presence of water: at the gelatinization point the starch uncoils from its crystal structure, breaks out of its granule, and traps water in its “arms.”

> It is interesting that some of Europe’s best bakers put a small percentage of rye flour in their sourdough country-style wheat breads. Although this is usually done for flavor, it is possible that the amylase in rye flour provides something of a fermentation boost to the wheat dough (by liberating more sugar), as long as the pH does not drop too low. This increases not only fermentation, but also crust browning if there is some increase in the sugar content of the dough as it is baked. European tests indicate that bread with a little rye in it has more volume and keeps better than a similar 100 percent wheat bread. This is in part because small amounts of added pentosans increase the effective strength of wheat flour, and may interfere with the process by which bread becomes stale.

> The chief nutritional benefits of whole grains are their fiber content (three times greater than white flour), mineral content, and oil content (including antioxidants).

> A mix of naturally fermented bread and other grain foods, beans, fruit, and vegetables will guarantee a full spectrum of amino acids in the diet, even without protein from animal sources. Fermented foods are an important source of vitamin B12 and biotin in a vegetarian diet.

> The easiest way to compare flours is to test their water absorptions by adding measured amounts of water to a known amount of flour until thorough mixing produces a firm and sticky ball. It will take less of a highprotein flour to make a ball, and more of a low-protein flour.

> The basic metabolism in yeast cells is useful to bakers: these cells convert carbohydrates into equal amounts of carbon dioxide and alcohol, making other organic molecules as byproducts. This conversion of carbohydrates is called fermentation. Yeasts are self-replicating and prolific. Given the right conditions and enough time the cells will double in number and keep on doubling until their waste products (alcohol and acids, predominantly) begin to poison them, or they run out of food. Bakers manipulate dough in order to encourage this fecundity.

> The higher acid content and more complete fermentation of naturally raised bread bestows other benefits, beyond flavor. The most important of these are the nutritional advantages that fermenting yields in whole grain breads, better resistance to mold or bacterial spoilage without additives, stronger crust and crumb structure (crumb is the cellular inner part of the bread), and rich crust color.

> Atavism is “the reappearance of a characteristic in an organism after several generations of absence . . .” (American Heritage Dictionary ),

> It is interesting that in many German and Russian bakeries, up to 30 percent of the flour used in pre-fermentation is added in the form of ground up stale bread. Aside from the potential for recycling a waste product, this makes it possible to intensify dough acidity as needed.

> Those with a technical bent should also read the conversation with Michael Gänzle in the “Baker’s Resource” in the back of the book.

> The key general principle is the same for both yeast and bacteria: the development of a ripe leaven is dependent much more on time and temperature than on the size of the inoculation.

> If the size of the inoculation is decreased by one half (say, from 40 percent of the final weight to 20 percent), the time from inoculation to full populations of bacterial and yeast cells (the static phase) is increased by one generation time. For sourdough bacteria under optimal conditions, this is a delay of about one hour, as the generation time of these bacteria is about one hour. For sourdough yeasts, the delay caused by halving the inoculation is about two hours—two hours is a typical generation time for yeasts under bakery conditions with temperatures in the mid-70s Fahrenheit.

> Bakers are interested in the acids produced by leaven microbes because much of the distinctive flavor of naturally fermented bread comes in the form of organic acids that are products of fermentation. Yeast and bacteria ferment because they need energy to grow and divide. Yeast fermentation may be aerobic, producing CO2, water, and a lot of energy, or anaerobic (as is typical in dough since the oxygen is used up quickly), producing CO2, ethanol, and less energy. Bacterial fermentation produces energy and organic acids (lactic, acetic, proprionic, and others), CO2, and ethanol. The spectrum of products depends on the organism and the environment. The proportion of lactic acid produced (relative to acetic acid) is increased in more liquid sponges, starters, and doughs, compared to stiffer ones.

> The sour taste of especially sour naturally leavened bread comes more from the total amount of acid in the bread than from the pH of the bread. Flours with a high ash (mineral) content tend to buffer the acid produced, while the mineral content also encourages vigorous bacterial growth. Thus, increasing the ash content of the flour is one way to increase the sourness of bread—the acid content gives the sour flavor at the same acidity level. One way to increase ash content is to add some rye flour or whole wheat flour, if you have been working with a white flour dough previously.

> The most common problems are death of a leaven, change in the apparent character of a leaven, or unreliability in the rising power of a leaven which works well sometimes but not all the time. It is my belief that these problems are usually caused by storing a leaven that is too ripe, by failing to adequately refresh a leaven that has been stored, by using a leaven that is not yet ripe enough to start a dough, by using a leaven that is too ripe to start a dough, or by failure to propagate the leaven in an appropriate temperature range.

> Allow your leaven refreshments to ferment at 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 24 degrees Celsius) so that neither yeasts nor bacteria are favored.

**Note:** This section on leaven care is fantastic.

> It is my belief that amateur bakers spend too much time talking about starting a natural leaven and too little time taking care of the ones they have.

> Still, there may be someone out there who does need to start a leaven because of some terrible misfortune—recently cast away on an island in the Caspian Sea, maybe, with fields of ripe wild wheat and no leaven.

> Here are six principles: First, the organisms you want are not likely to come out of the air. The yeast you want may come from grain or fruit, but the bacteria are more likely to come from you. Experiments that have attempted to culture L. Sanfranciscensis from the air (or from grain) have been uniformly unsuccessful. In academic microbiology circles there is a rumor that the only place (aside from leaven cultures) that L. Sanfranciscensis has been found is in dental plaque! So it is more likely that the bacteria in your sourdough will come from you than from the air. The yeast you want may be on ogranic grain, though.

> Third, I recommend you use a mixture of wheat and rye flour for your initial sponge. Wheat because that is what most bread is made of, and rye because it has a greater mineral content, which favors microbial growth. Using just rye flour or just wheat flour will work, though.

> More CO2 will develop as the loaf re-proofs, and the slight stiffness that cooler temperature brings to the dough seems to potentiate oven spring—you can get well-shaped loaves of bread from a slightly more hydrated dough. If you like the flavor better, it is probably due to more complete fermentation than you could usually use without making the dough too weak for easy handling. There will be one difference in the appearance of the loaves—small crust blisters caused by gas that escaped from the crust while it was in the refrigerator.

> If you and your leaven get out of synchronization because you haven’t used it in a while, the universal treatment is to throw out all but about 20 percent of it (to remove its acid load), then replenish it to its original volume and wait until it is full of bubbles again. Then refresh it by tripling it each time it gets really bubbly or triples in volume. When the culture can again get to this point in six to eight hours at a temperature of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius), it has recovered completely from storage and is ready to be used in a dough. Acidity and cell counts will have come into line and your fermentation results will again be predictable.

> Using a very active starter will mean that you use only 20 percent (summer) to 40 percent (winter) leaven sponge in your dough, and this will prevent excessive flattening of your loaves in proof (from slack gluten, due to excess acid).

> There is a fairly high proportion of dead cells in a package of yeast—fewer in instant yeast—and even more cells will die as the yeast is rehydrated. The proportion of dying cells is lowered if the water in which the yeast is reconstituted is at ideal temperature (105 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, 41 to 46 degrees Celsius).5 Dead yeast cells release glutathione and proteases—chemicals that can interfere with the linking of gluten and thus with the quality of the bread.

> lowered if the water in which the

> Research in the U.S. and France suggests that small quantities of commercial yeast (up to 0.2 percent of the weight of the flour used, or about one-seventh the usual amount used for yeasted bread) will increase the rate of rising with relatively little effect on other qualities. The pH of the resulting bread is about 4.6. The commercial yeast will live long enough to boost gas production before it is out-competed by more acetic acid–tolerant yeasts.

> Two doughs may have the same pH without having the same amount of acid if the flour/water proportions of the doughs are different, or if one dough has a markedly different ash content. The intensity of sour flavor in sourdough bread is more dependent on acid content than on pH. Using a higher-ash flour and allowing a longer fermentation to the same pH is one way to make very sour bread.

> Rye bakers need a lot of acid to inhibit the rye flour amylase, which would break down the starch that rye dough needs for its structure.

> Rye bakers are not worried about pH-related inhibition of the yeast portion of the sourdough culture. Rye doughs never have the gas-trapping capacity of wheat doughs, so lower gas production is not much of a liability.

> Start the dough process seventy-two hours before mixing the final dough,

**Note:** Try this?

> From the stiff, slow starter you will bring a big load of acid. From the fresher, thinner starter you will bring a big load of highly active yeast cells. The final bread will be both light and acid. If it isn’t acid enough, you can increase the amount of the seventy-two-hour sponge in the bread. If it isn’t light enough, increase the fresher sponge.

> Bread consists of approximately one part water and three parts flour, by volume—a handy ratio to remember. Very fresh flour (such as home-milled whole wheat flour) will take a little more water than this.

> What is not commonly known is that salt has effects on dough chemistry, not just taste. Salt helps baking dough take on a golden color and helps create an open crumb texture. Too much salt makes the crumb texture tight and prevents full proofing and springing of the loaf.

> Salt has an unusual effect on the mechanical properties of gluten and dough. Salt makes properly conditioned gluten tighter and at the same time able to endure more stretch without injury. The gluten essentially becomes stronger. R.C. Hoseney sums up current thinking on the nature of salt’s effect on gluten by explaining that some of the atoms in gluten are positively charged, and the positive charges repulse one another. When salt is added, chlorine ions from the salt bond with the gluten, cancelling the effect of the positive charges and allowing it to compact, tighten, and stiffen—the cohesive gluten becomes stronger.

> There are two reasons the leaven is added late: one is that it is already well hydrated and essentially digested by its long fermentation; the other is that one of the reasons for the autolyse is to allow the flour proteins and damaged starch plenty of time to completely hydrate before they are exposed to the acid of the leaven, or to salt.

> The goal of kneading is to obtain a dough that is both elastic and extensible, that resists stretching but stretches without tearing.

> Hoseney has shown that the stability of dough (its resistance to overmixing) is significantly lower at a low dough pH—such as that in naturally leavened bread. That is one reason that artisan bakers have to be careful when selecting mixers and setting mixing times.

> In the two countries thought by many to have the worst commercial bread in the world, England and Australia, the process of mechanical mixing is extended to an art form.

> The Magic Mill mixer, made by Electrolux in Sweden,

> This is called molding or shaping, and a variety of techniques are used to avoid trapping excess air in the dough, which would create a big bubble in the loaf. Shaping must stretch the gluten net of the dough in all directions, as it will be stretched by its growing gas cells. Seams on the dough roll must be sealed to prevent unrolling as the bread proofs and bakes, but the dough must be handled gently—a difficult balance to achieve.

> Most masonry oven bakers load two or four loaves at a time onto a large peel, to keep their ovens open a shorter time.

> One benefit of Alan’s high temperature proof is that he achieves it by heating water (in electric skillets) at the base of his proofing cabinet—this gives him a little less than 100 percent humidity at 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The skin of his dough remains fully hydrated when it goes into the masonry oven. Such loaves may not need slashing, except for decoration.

> There are charts on Doug’s wall for “Products and Price Levels” (details the volume price break points and price for all products) and for “Production Limits” (how much of each product the facility can turn out in a day—

> Drying is part of baking, but a smaller part than you might expect. In fact, dough only loses 12 percent of its weight as it is baked.

> What turns dough into bread is an amazing chain of physical events and chemical transformations, most of which involve shifts in water within the dough.

> Gas cell expansion at a time when the dough is still very soft produces the oven spring that is essential to the pleasing appearance of a loaf of bread.*

> If an oven is too cool the gas won’t boil out of the dough fast enough, water won’t boil and turn to steam fast enough, and the pressure rise in the dough won’t rise high enough to overcome the tendency for the loaf to sag and spread as it heats and thus gets softer.

> If an oven is never hot enough to dry and bake the crust sufficiently, bread will cook through without forming attractive crust color or flavor. Bread cooked experimentally in a microwave never undergoes these reactions and is devoid of bread flavor: it’s cooked paste.

> Bread cooked experimentally in a microwave

> It is the push of the relatively liquid crumb, as it is heated, that thrusts apart the slash in the crust, forming the shred of the loaf and completing oven spring.

> Most ovens are hard-pressed to maintain their maximum cooking effect in the face of a quantity of cool, moist dough, both because of the thermal load of the cool dough and because of the continuing requirement for heat as water and volatile compounds are boiled out of the dough.

> Moisture and heat are two of the secrets to chewy and colorful crust—the kind of crust that is hard to produce in a metal kitchen oven. The degree to which starch in the dough will gelatinize depends on the presence of adequate available moisture and the maintenance of temperature within a specific range. Because bread crust dries out in the later stages of baking, its temperature will far exceed the boiling point of water, while the crumb will not. This high temperature sets (dehydrates) the starch gel, but excessive drying will crack it and burn it.

> The degree to which starch in the dough will gelatinize depends on the presence of adequate available moisture and the maintenance of temperature within a specific range.

> At least enough moisture must be present to allow gelatinization before the crust begins to dry out. The crust really gets cooked twice: once wet and once dry. Moisture keeps the developing crust flexible and plastic in the early stages of baking so it can accommodate the oven spring of the dough without ripping excessively or constricting the loaf. Moisture is necessary for the action of the enzymes that release sugar in baking, after the yeast is killed. This sugar is necessary to the Maillard reactions, and the Maillard reactions themselves require the presence of water.

> An oven which is moist and hot at first, and dry and slightly cooler later, will produce a moderately thick, slightly chewy, and moderately crisp crust with full flavor: hearth bread.

> Humidified air has a higher heat content, and will start the baking process that much faster, driving heat into the interior of the loaf. In contrast, a crust which is sprayed directly with cold water will be cooled, delaying gelatinization.

> Although brick-oven bakers have historically tried to pre-saturate oven air as they swab ashes off the oven floor, most or all of that moisture is immediately lost out the mouth of the oven. Instead, it is probably better to spray into the oven with a three-head fogging nozzle on a garden hose wand (the nozzles are usually used in greenhouses and nurseries) just as the oven is closed. (Pump-up garden sprayers also work, but use one that has never held chemicals.)

> If more moisture is desired, a wet towel can be draped over the inside of the oven door before it is closed. This should be removed in ten or fifteen minutes, to allow the bread to dry and the crust to set. Don’t leave the oven door off for a long time in the early part of baking, as the dough at that time is quite delicate, with softened protein and little ge-latinization. A fully loaded and tightly sealed oven shouldn’t need supplementary steam after the first few minutes.

> If you are sure you are fermenting adequately, your dough is not too stiff, and your loaves are rising well, but your crumb seems tight, try adding a little lower-protein flour to your dough. This can be especially useful in pizza dough, to make it crisp but not too tough.

> So-called lean-dough formulas (with no added fat or with fat less than 3 percent) will usually make a more open crumb than richer dough, and acid doughs will tend to give a more open crumb, too.

> A wetter, more extensible dough will also produce a more open crumb than a stiff dough.

> Research has shown that an air temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit at a humidity level of 85 percent is best to prevent excessive cracking and shrinking of typical commercial pan bread.

> The dry, highly gelatinized starch in the crust is water-loving, and attracts moisture from the crumb and the atmosphere.

> Breads made from refined flours (without bran) dry out rapidly in comparison to whole grain breads, in part because some of the non-starch polysaccharides in bran hold on to water better than starch does. The presence of these bran polysaccharides is one reason whole grain breads take longer to “set” after baking.

> The following techniques will help you avoid stale bread without using additives:

> • Use natural leavens, as the persistent swelling of gluten at low pH will deprive starch of some of its potential water, and thereby prevent it from retrograding so quickly. • Don’t over-ferment, as this contributes off-flavors that may predominate as the bread stales. Also, over-fermented bread has poor volume, which accelerates the retrogradation process. • Eat fresh bread. If the rest of the bread is to be eaten that day or the next, leave it out—turned up on its cut surface—or put it in a paper bag to allow it to breathe, while the crust stays dry. • Bread that won’t be eaten within thirty-six hours should be cooled to 90 degrees Fahrenheit or below, then frozen in a sealed plastic bag at 0 degrees Fahrenheit or below. When you take it out of the freezer, leave it in the plastic bag while it thaws until visible signs of water on the outside and the inside of the bag have disappeared. Then take it out of the bag. Bread that is thawed at room temperature will be palatable, but can be made nearly as good as fresh bread if it is thoroughly reheated and allowed partially to cool before serving. • Don’t store bread in the refrigerator (Ever! Because it goes stale quickly!) unless you are going to use it for croutons!

> Michel says you need two thousand square feet to make twelve hundred to fifteen hundred loaves of good bread per day, including a retail store, and you need a realistic budget.

> Maybe the first step is just to buy a better mixer, making sure to get equipment that won’t be obsolete with the next step. Plan for the long term.

> Michel, like Alan Scott, feels that the first steps of breadmaking are the most critical: ingredients, ferment, mixing/kneading—problems that develop here cannot be corrected later.

> Michel feels starter leavens should be made from organic flour, either whole wheat or at least a high ash, high extraction type, or with added rye.

> In any fermentation, the less you handle the dough, the better structure you will have. Every time you cut a piece of dough, you are cutting the structure, and you have to handle it just right to repair the structure. Even then, there will be a scar. Tearing the dough is even worse, and at any stage of the process, you want to work with the biggest piece you can. That’s one reason for tilting devices to unload the mixer.

> To get a nice lift and curl on the slash, let the surface of the bread dry out a little before it is slashed, to make the skin a little stronger. Allowing some skin to form on the bottom of a loaf as it is proofing in a retarder or in open air may improve the appearance of the bread—a better bottom crust and a better curl to the slash.

> the presence of sharp bran particles prevents very high loaves by penetrating the larger gas cells and deflating them as the bread rises.

> The oven face was stone, and the floor of the foyer was either rammed earth or paved with small stones.

> There was typically a wooden plaque on the outside face of the oven building on which tags were hung to indicate the order in which village families were to bake their bread.

> The leaven was carefully kept from baking day to baking day, in a stone jar in a cool spot. In the winter the leaven was revitalized by putting it in a warm bed.

> Alan Scott built the oven, George Gonzales cut and laid volcanic stone from the Sierras, then a landscaper rolled in some boulders. This oven is the American equivalent of the great stone ovens of Europe.

> One of Iott’s informants told her, “It isn’t tradition that assures the survival of our bread; it is the bread that assures the survival of our traditions.”

> Some Mediterranean flatbreads (such as pizza) are baked in horizontal ovens on the Roman plan, but with the fire maintained in one side or at the back of the oven chamber, not raked out. These ovens bake by a combination of retained heat and continuous heat, but they are somewhat more efficient than the tandoor for baking large quantities of bread, if well designed so an excessive draft is avoided. They do not require the same mass of masonry (the walls can be thinner) as retained-heat ovens.

> second type is typified by the gueulard oven, a hybrid in which a firebox below the front third of the oven is vented into the oven itself through a removable cast iron elbow, the gueulard. The floor of the oven is inclined a few degrees, making the oven easier to load and unload with a peel, increasing the draft during firing, and effectively holding in steam during baking. The oven is exhausted through a rear flue which can be shut with a damper. The oven door is metal, and is counter-balanced so it may be easily opened and held out of the way, or closed.

> Most European hybrid commercial ovens had a hearth about ten feet long and eight feet wide.

> Several weeks after my visit I got a copy of the Mission Statement of American Flatbread: 1. To produce good, flavorful, nutritious food. Food that gives us joy and health; 2. To create pleasant and fulfilling work for those of us who bake Flatbread; 3. To produce, package, and distribute our product in as environmentally conscientious a way as our resources and imagination allow us. To be proactive in this: to discover new ways of doing these things better; 4. To support with our voices and buying power: local, regional, and sustainable agriculture; the forces of peace and understanding; the cultural, economic, and environmental needs of native peoples worldwide; the ecological needs of the wild fauna and flora; 5.

> Individual-sized pizzas are made (mild sauce and cheese) to appeal to the tastes of hospitalized children who have lost their appetite for institutional food. These pizzas are delivered to pediatric units at the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington, to the Yale–New Haven Medical Center, and to the Shriners Burn Institute in Boston. • The “seconds” from the regular pizza production are frozen and delivered to residents of the Mad River Valley who are ill or injured and unable to cook for themselves or their family members. • Lastly, all the leftover dough from the restaurant operation is brushed with garlic-infused olive oil and baked as “garlic bread” for delivery to the Vermont Food Bank.

> The Cheese Board vision is to make good tasting, attractive, hand-formed bread that people want to eat, and to provide an honest living and enjoyable workplace for the members of the collective.

> The leavens are kept in five-gallon buckets on a low stainless steel counter/sink. That way they are easy to lift by the handle, and if one becomes too active and bubbles over, the mess is easy to clean.

> called internal combustion, retained-heat ovens (or direct-fired) because wood is burned, the ashes are removed, and the bread is put into the fire chamber to bake.

> Ovens with accessory flues and no way to recycle the heat carried out in the exhaust are usually less fuel efficient than ovens that vent out the door.

> By direct heat I mean that a fire continues to burn in the oven chamber while the bread is baked, as in the Indian tandoor or in Italian roasting and pizza ovens. Retained heat means that the fire is removed before the food is cooked. This is the way loaves of bread are baked.

> Even more important is the operation or management of the oven (chapter 10), because firing a cold oven to baking heat requires heat that will never be recovered by baking bread. (This has been referred to as the preheat by oven-efficiency researchers.)

> An efficient directly-fired oven will have a door that is about 63 percent the height of the inside of its dome.

> A retained-heat oven designed for daily use may therefore be especially massive, so the heat storage is great and the oven temperature is stable. For intermittent use, overall efficiency will be higher in lighter ovens because the oven must be preheated each time it is used; the preheat cost is less for a less massive oven. The drawback of a light oven is that the oven temperature will be less stable if it is used in a retained-heat mode—it will cool off more quickly as it is used.

> If an ash-drop slot is provided, it should be outside the door as well.

> Ovens that are deeper (longer) than they are wide tend to draw well and are probably more efficient than round or square ovens, although careful construction of the area just inside the door of a round oven can offset this problem somewhat.

> Boily and Blanchette determined by direct measurements that there is a critical best ratio between the height of an oven door and the height of the oven dome. That ratio is 63: 100, or 63 percent. (Folk tradition sometimes holds 4:7 to be the ratio, which is 57 percent—quite close!) This represents the average ratio for Quebec ovens that do not have supplemental air vents, which was one of the ways that Boily and Blanchette were able to determine which Quebec designs worked best.

> Practical experience has shown that a ceiling height of fifteen to eighteen inches is optimal for baking loaf breads, because a lower ceiling will necessitate an impractically low door, and a higher one will reduce the moisture content around the loaves and reduce crust formation. (This rule does not have to be followed so exactly for an oven built primarily for pizza or for mixed baking and roasting. The door and dome may be somewhat higher, but still at the 63 percent ratio.)

> A masonry thickness of eight inches in the hearth and about seven inches in the dome works well for an oven that is used intermittently, or is used for both bread and pizza (the fire is pushed to the back of the oven but continues to burn while the pizza bakes). An oven used only for pizza can make do with two and one-half to three inches of masonry in its walls, and five inches in the hearth. (This may not pass the building code in some areas, and may require the use of a much thicker outer oven, or enclosure.) Such a thin oven will be easy to bring to proper heat. An oven used to bake loaf bread on a daily basis should have at least ten and one-half inches of masonry in the dome, and a little more in the hearth.

> Richard Freeman has two brick ovens in one: an inner arch of bricks, a layer of insulation, and an enclosure of bricks.

> The heated mass of the oven should be isolated from the foundation to reduce heat loss and to prevent cracking of the foundation when the oven is heated.

> Modern internal combustion ovens will retain the advantages of their predecessors while avoiding the drawbacks mentioned above by employing these critical features: • one door and no vents; • external chimneys and ash drops; • the 63 percent ratio of door and dome; • baking chamber is deeper than it is wide; • oven mounted on a slab that can expand and contract without cracking the oven foundation; • a smooth neck to permit unhindered air flow and easy ash and bread removal; • well insulated; • mass and wall thickness appropriate to their intended use; • thermocouple (heat sensor) systems to assess firing and baking conditions; • firebrick hearths that transfer heat to the bread at the correct rate when the oven is properly heated.

> bake ten large pizzas or ninety loaves of pan bread at a time, and will always require more wood than a small oven. A more modest oven makes better sense for domestic use, indoors or out.

> Larger family ovens are 36 x 48 inches; interestingly, this is the size of most old farmstead ovens in this country and Europe, where all the bread for a family was baked once a week.

> Commercial ovens for small bakeries are typically 4 x 6 feet up to a practical limit of 6 x 8 feet (larger ovens are possible, but are usually fired with gas, or are either hybrid or white ovens).

> Some restaurant ovens are higher, wider, and shorter than the ones described here; they are designed for roasting as well as for bread and pizzas.

> Uniform Building Code, oven domes may need to be 10 inches thick (including bricks) when lined with red brick, and only 8 inches thick when lined with firebrick.

> It is essential to have a flat surface onto which you can place dough, pans, boards, cornmeal, your fire gloves, and everything else you need. Of course, you need a table, a rack, or baskets for the bread you have baked. For outdoor ovens, it is good to have a covered area in front of the oven, with a counter at hearth height running out from the side of the oven facade.

> Try to keep the oven close to the kitchen door, or if indoors, close to or in the kitchen, and not in the basement.

> there is no hose faucet nearby, mount a fire extinguisher to the oven base somewhere, to back up your bucket of water. Watch the oven during the early part of the burn, when it might throw sparks.

> The oven has since been rebuilt and improved, and they no longer bake (the technical word is “coke”) their firewood in this fashion.

> it is helpful to have a series of them at various levels of the thickness of the masonry. That makes it easy to see when the oven has been heated enough and easy to see when the stored heat in the masonry is too low to continue baking. The main drawback to thermocouples is cost—both the probes and the gauges are expensive.

> The exception to this discussion about removable doors is for small commercial bakeries, where it is more convenient to use counterweighted doors that either fall away in front of the peel or lift up out of the way (into the chimney recess) when activated by the baker.

> I favor a masonry cap (a thin, reinforced slab) that is completely watertight and can be removed if you need to modify your oven in the future.

> What is your comfortable working height? For most people it is a little below elbow level. Remember that this is the height of the finished hearth, not the height of the ash-dump walls or the height of the top of the hearth slab. The traditional height of a European hearth is 90 centimeters—about 35½ inches; however, many bakers like a higher hearth. A lower one will not do, unless children will be actively involved with the oven, as at a school.

> Will you use Portland cement or alumina-based concrete for the hearth slab and cladding of the oven, and how thick will the cladding be? Use alumina and a thicker cladding if you are going to be baking every day, or if you want to bake more than three loads per firing.

> Do you want thermocouples, and how many? I recommend at least one in the wall or dome, and one in the hearth, but having a series of three of them in line somewhere in the dome is even better.

> Will you insulate the bottom of the hearth slab to save heat? This will be worthwhile if you plan to use the oven more than once a week, and it adds little expense or labor.

> As this book is written I know of only one company making modular masonry ovens designed primarily for baking loaf breads—Dietmeyer, Ward, and Stroud of Vashon Island, Washington, makes both retained-heat and white modular ovens in small, household sizes—but beginning in the early 1980s, several companies began to import or manufacture multipurpose ovens designed primarily for baking flatbreads and for roasting, but usable for loaf breads. Some have domes of refractory concrete, some of high-fired refractory clay.

> The masonry of a retained-heat oven should be at least four inches thick to guarantee that enough heat can be stored for two bakes without refiring.

> In the late 1980s, she began to bring in small ceramic ovens handmade in Italy by the Valoriani family,

> Although it is environmentally appropriate and economically sound to use locally available materials and labor when possible (which is certainly possible when ovens are built of native clay, or of bricks made from native clay, or of a refractory mixture of alumina cement and heat-resistant native rock), not every part of the U.S. has good clay, a local brick kiln, or a source of heat-resistant rock. The scratch materials you buy may have been trucked two thousand miles, while a prefabricated European oven will have been shipped to this country by water, a relatively efficient method, and trucked a few hundred miles.

> When the cement is resistant to high temperatures, it is called refractory cement; mixed with an appropriate aggregate, it becomes refractory concrete or mortar.

> Sack mixes are fine for a slab on grade, adequate for the cladding or the hearth slab of a home oven, but are best avoided for cladding or hearth slabs of ovens larger than 32 x 36 inches, or ovens used every day—regardless of size.

> but for oven construction, all calcium aluminate cements should have less than 45 percent alumina, so that they remain resistant to thermal cycling.

> Any castable which is exposed to thermal cycling should have an alumina content of 35 to 45 percent, and a porosity of 20 percent or more, to reduce cracking. Avoid using steel reinforcement in refractories exposed to high heat (oven hearths or inner domes). Put the steel in an outer cladding or slab that has smaller temperature cycles.

> In Finland, France, and other European countries, special materials are maufactured for oven hearths that are even less resistant to heat than standard firebrick, but more resistant to thermal shock.

> Brick is available in a variety of shapes, including a bull-nose brick that makes an attractive lip on the front end of the hearth of a masonry oven. The rounded end is also resistant to chipping.

> You will have to buy plans from Ovencrafters if you want to make a larger or smaller oven. In general, though, the principles of construction remain the same.

> Those who are going to do production baking (usually with a bigger oven) will want a door that will fold down into the oven in front of the peel, or at least a lightweight door that can be flipped back on the outer hearth. These will reduce the amount of time the oven is open, and will serve as a rest for the peel as it is moved in and out of the oven. Hinged, counterweighted doors are available from Ovencrafters.

> The goal of firing the oven is to end up with a clean oven that has a masonry dome temperature about 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) hotter than the walls or the hearth. The temperature of the dome will be about 75 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 38 degrees Celsius) hotter than the air temperature in the oven. The air temperature for most breads will be about 450 degrees Fahrenheit (235 degrees Celsius) and the temperature of the inner surface of the masonry will be 525 degrees Fahrenheit (275 degrees Celsius).

> In general, logs or sticks less than 4 inches in diameter work better than larger logs for heating ovens. Their greater surface area means that more of the wood gets to burn at one time; there is also more surface area for radiation. After the fire is going, longer logs work better than short ones because they carry the fire into the back of the oven without reloading.

> Since the oven takes on heat in part by radiation, a bright fire is better than a smoldering pile of thick logs, and hardwood is only needed when a fire is going to be maintained for some time, as in cooking pizzas.

> The purpose of firing the oven is to heat the masonry mass. An oven that is to be used every day (for one load or many) will work best if it is raised to baking temperature and maintained there, assuming it is well insulated. Once stored, the heat should not be wasted.

> He doesn’t believe in mopping the hearth; he props up the oven door on a brick in front of the oven, then blows residual ash out with a five-horsepower shop vacuum with an extended tube. This clears most of the ash, which vanishes up the chimney. Then he does the same thing with compressed air and cleans the dome with a fog of water from a greenhouse sprayer.

> Taken together, one can state the following: A. The optimum temperature for sourdough lactobacilli is 32–33°C. Above and below that range, for instance at 37°C    and 20°C, the generation time is twice as long. B. At 39°C and 15°C, the generation time is four times as long. C. At 41°C and 4°C, no growth is observed.

> For the yeasts, the figures are as follows: A. 28°C (optimum growth) B. 32°C and 20°C (double generation time) C. 34°C and 14°C (fourfold generation time) D. 35°C and 8°C: no growth.

> the definition of a “three-stage sourdough process” makes no sense—one may think of each of the “sourdough stages” as just a link in an infinite chain of repeated inoculations. But most of us will still continue to use the traditional terms to describe them!

> DW: Many knowledgeable people are surprised when I tell them it is possible to raise dough with bacteria, in the absence of any kind of yeast. MG: We’ve done the experiments, it works quite well without yeast. The volume is somewhat smaller, though. Markus Brandt has estimated the contribution of yeasts and lactobacilli to gas production in a normal sourdough: about 50 percent comes from lactobacilli and yeasts each. The yeasts are fewer in numbers, but larger in size. Lactobacterial fermentation releases plenty of CO2.

> The production of lactic acid in dough is determined mainly by the buffering capacity of the flour, i.e. the ash content. Dough hydration and temperature are much less important, as far as Spicher’s investigations go. I think that the higher lactic acid content he measured in doughs fermented at higher temperature or lower hydration is due mainly to the faster rate of fermentation in these conditions.

> As far as the influence of acetic acid and lactic acid on flavor go: lactic acid has no influence on aroma, only on taste, while acetic acid is an aroma volatile. So, I think it is not so much the ratio of lactic to acetic acid, but more simply the acetic acid content that matters in bread aroma.

> Yeasts in dough don’t have to rely on oxygen for growth: if that were the case, they wouldn’t be there, as oxygen is quickly depleted.

> DW: Many new sourdough bakers in the U.S. are intimidated by recommendations by some authors to work with large volumes when new cultures are propagated. This isn’t sensible, is it? MG: I agree with you: one gram of dough is one billion lactobacilli and ten million yeasts: more than enough to sustain the culture. In the lab, I’m doing most experiments on a 1/10 ml scale. For dough refreshments at home, it does not get much smaller than 10 grams (2 teaspoons): it’s difficult to handle smaller amounts.

> DW: How often must cultures held at room temperature be refreshed to maintain the sourdough flora? MG: The main requirement for sourdoughs containing L. sanfranciscensis is repeated, frequent refreshment (not counting storage in the refrigerator). Peter Stolz said that one refreshment every twenty-four hours will suffice. If intervals are much longer than that (let’s say more than three days), different, more acid-tolerant organisms may evolve (e.g., L. pontis).

> So, formation of aroma precursors during dough fermentation is crucial for the Maillard reaction, leading to some of the distinctive flavor of well-fermented bread.
