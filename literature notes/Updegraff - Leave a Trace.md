# Leave a Trace by Michael Updegraff

URL: <https://dark-mountain.net/leave-a-trace/>

> With clear-cut mountain ranges and untold acres of erosion in the rearview mirror, a large-scale shift in understanding began to take root. Modern people began to think of our relationship to nature as inherently *exploitative*, rather than one of symbiotic stewardship. This ‘humanity-as-pestilence’ philosophy resonated deeply with the public psyche where people were most disconnected from direct involvement in the natural world.

> It’s important to understand, however, that the ‘Leave No Trace’ philosophy became necessary not because of a greater refinement or evolution of human self-awareness but *because of an overall loss of knowledge and sense of place in the natural world.* We restrict our involvement with the forest because we are no longer at home there; we don’t know how to be there, how to take care of it; we are, in fact, *fearful* of anything outside artificial surroundings.

> It is the dissociation of product and process that creates this tension. If we apply the strictures of ‘Leave No Trace’ to woodworking, we encounter an interesting ethical quandary. Like the tenderhearted urbanite who is comfortable only with chicken from the supermarket, skinless, boneless, and wrapped in plastic, woodworkers who know nothing firsthand of the natural world find themselves estranged from their craft’s *material substance*. There are wood consumers who wince to think of actually chopping down a tree for lumber just as there are shoppers who find the idea of personally taking an animal’s life for food unconscionable. This is part and parcel of consumerism: We no longer need to *consider* or *feel* the death of the animal that made that meal or the tree that yielded that wide, clear board. But cookouts and blanket chests don’t come out of nowhere. More often than not, ‘Leave No Trace’ means that we are simply moving the ‘trace’ somewhere else, comfortably out of sight – whether lithium mine, slaughterhouse, or clearcut.

> Economist E.F. Schumacher called such an approach ‘appropriate technology.’ As in, how should we employ our tools and technologies in the most appropriate way, for us, for our children and for our neighbours? It may well be that an axe is a more appropriate tool for you than a tree harvester, the spinning wheel might make more sense than factory automation, or the tuned-up hand plane might just replace your thickness planer. As a personal choice, it means we actually do have the option of pulling a foot out of the web of industrialization and into quieter, more traditional means. As Schumacher wrote, ‘Ever bigger machines, entailing ever bigger concentrations of economic power and exerting ever greater violence against the environment, do not represent progress: they are a denial of wisdom. Wisdom demands a new orientation of science and technology towards the organic, the gentle, the non-violent, the elegant and beautiful.’
