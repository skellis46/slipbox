# Martha Beck - Beyond Anxiety Curiosity, Creativity, and Finding Your Life’s Purpose

_previous note:_

> Each new study I read gave me more hope, especially a study where neurologists peered into the brains of Tibetan monks who had spent years in meditation. These men, it was found, had unusually dense tissue in the brain regions associated with happiness, compassion, and calm.

> To stop doing this, we can shift our neural activity to a different set of brain structures and functions—the ones that generate curiosity, wonder, connection, compassion, and awe. Learning to use our brains in this way relies on science, but as I’ve said, it’s ultimately an art.

> In fact, “commingling with creation” may sound silly or nonsensical to you, especially since words can’t really describe it. The closest I can come here is to tell you that this union with creation is a state of effortless flow in which you completely forget your anxiety—and even the part of yourself that felt anxious.

> Anxiety, on the other hand, is more like being haunted. It pulls our attention inward to worrisome thoughts and fantasies, away from our actual physical situation in the present. Its vague sense of doom presses down on us without suggesting any constructive action. And unlike healthy fear, anxiety never relents. It may not only persist but also increase in situations where we’re completely safe. This constant dread worsens our health, our relationships, our ability to fulfill our hopes and dreams.

> Our brains, unlike those of any other animal, can hold information as a verbal story and elaborate on it with imagination. We like to believe that we are the “rational” species, as coolly logical as Sherlock Holmes. But, in fact, our thoughts and decisions are driven largely by what’s happening at the emotional levels of our brains.

> I’ve seen bosses destroy their companies by controlling every aspect of their employees’ work lives until those employees broke free and ran for the hills.

> (As an unknown author once said, “I am an old man and have known many troubles, but most of them never happened.”)

> For example, a client I’ll call Kayla once walked into a room where her husband was typing on his cell phone. He immediately swiped the screen clear and turned to her with a little too much enthusiasm. “I felt this horrible jolt,” Kayla told me. “I thought, He’s lying. What’s he into? Gambling? Porn? Is he having an affair?” With each thought, the jolt of dread repeated, growing worse as the stories multiplied. “I felt so betrayed I started an argument,” Kayla said. “By the time he admitted he’d been planning my birthday party, I was half-convinced my marriage was over.”

> And we humans have built a macro version of our brains’ anxiety mechanism into the society we’ve created. Modern culture is like a massive anxiety spiral in which countless clever brains busily spin out terrifying stories and control strategies 24/

> This is the self-defeating logic of anxiety; it makes us truly believe that the only way to feel safe is to never feel safe.

> The bad news is that however frightened we become, and however hard we try to control other people and situations, anxiety-based actions tend to breed more anxiety, leading to upward spirals of terror and violence.

> But as Oxford psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says, “It would be just as foolish to believe that therefore there are no important hemisphere differences. There are massively important ones, which lie at the core of what it means to be a human being.”

> With her left hemisphere inactive, Jill experienced herself as a field of energy the size of the entire universe. In this right-hemisphere consciousness there was no time, just an infinite present moment. Jill couldn’t remember the names of common objects, let alone of people, but she was extraordinarily attuned to her fellow humans’ physical and emotional energy. She later wrote that her consciousness felt “like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria.” She was intensely aware, filled with inexpressible compassion and gratitude.

> The happiness of the left hemisphere comes from positive external conditions, while the right hemisphere feels a joy born from within.

> But evolution has given us the opposite tendency—we tend to focus on whatever makes us feel worse, or at least more uneasy. Two of the mechanisms responsible for this are the brain’s “negativity bias” and something I call the “hall of mirrors.” Recognizing and understanding these neurological quirks can help us step away from their influence.

> Our culture is dominated by the verbal, abstract thinking most prominent in the left hemisphere, so your socialization pulls hard toward the assumption that reading about an experience, or thinking about it in words, is the same thing as actually living it. In fact, you’ve been trained to believe that thinking is superior to experiencing.

> Jill told me that she’d structured her whole life to access the best aspects of her entire brain. (She’d just published Whole Brain Living, a wonderful book that I highly recommend.)

> Where the brain’s left-side spiral sparks fear and makes us want to control things, its right-side spiral sparks curiosity and makes us want to create things.

> But because the right hemisphere doesn’t track time, it perceives only what’s there in the moment.

> The upper layers of your right brain, unlike their left-side counterparts, don’t analyze, predict, or worry about control. Instead, they form connections between ideas, actions, and people. Where the left side analyzes (the word analyze means “to cut things apart”), the right side synthesizes, or puts things together.

> The anxiety spiral blocks out information coming from the right hemisphere. By contrast, the creativity spiral welcomes everything we perceive, including data flowing in through the left hemisphere. It can use the left hemisphere’s insights to create items that are useful (like a labor-saving machine), satisfying (like the solution to a mystery), exciting (like meeting a new friend), or expressive (like singing a love song). These experiences often create positive feedback—a sense of fascination and “flow.” We feel heightened curiosity and a desire for more experience, leading to more investigation, which leads to more inventive connection, and so on.

> If your friends think this is weird, know that you are making significant progress.

> We’re living in a culture that’s heavily biased toward a very specific kind of thinking and behaving—the way preferred by the left hemisphere. This bias is so strong that one expert, the psychiatrist and Oxford scholar Iain McGilchrist, says we all act like “people with right hemisphere brain damage.”

> By contrast, Nicky spends her life in environments full of straight lines, rigid angles, and artificial everything, from snack foods to fabrics to light. Our left brains heartily approve of this. As McGilchrist writes, “The left hemisphere likes things that are man-made…because we put them together. They are not, like living things, constantly changing and moving, beyond our grasp.” They’re also easier to handle with the left hemisphere’s preferred tools: force, logic, and control.

> As McGilchrist writes, “The left hemisphere likes things that are man-made…because

> In the year 2000, biological anthropologist Joseph Henrich coined the acronym WEIRD to describe countries that are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. Henrich believes that we citizens of the WEIRD world have dramatically different psyches from our ancestors: more object obsessed, more driven, and—you guessed it—more anxious.

> Don’t forget, the left hemisphere’s hall-of-mirrors effect makes it absolutely certain that its perceptions are fundamentally correct, that no other way of thinking is, by God, right.

> (As Iain McGilchrist says, “Magic is the way that the left hemisphere sees powers over which it has no control.”)

> Are you getting the picture here? Accept whatever you’re feeling, including any part of you that refuses to accept what you’re feeling. Keep this up long enough and you’ll begin to connect with your genuine capacity for acceptance.

> Voss recommends imitating the deep, measured, thoughtful voice Oprah used while questioning her innumerable TV guests. If you haven’t seen her do this, google it. Then spend a few minutes finding your own low, slow voice.

> You may be thinking that whispering to your amygdala sounds like a complicated process. But, actually, because it’s instinctive, amygdala whispering is far more normal than detailing everything that ever went wrong in your childhood or listing all the religious vows you may have taken and then broken. Here’s a summary of the whole process I’ve described above: Notice your anxiety creature. Sigh. Soften your eye focus. Move a little. Accept that you feel the way you feel. Make soothing sounds. Offer yourself kind wishes.

> Notice your anxiety creature. Sigh. Soften your eye focus. Move a little.

> (google “guilty dogs” to see some adorable fawning).

> This combination became problematic when Cassie traveled. She used to call me from various airports after deboarding various airplanes and glumly report, “I did it again.” “It” consisted of Cassie washing down a Xanax with a glass of wine before the plane even took off. Once airborne, Cassie would take one look out the window, then grip the arm of whoever happened to be seated next to her. Eventually, when her anxiety had battled its way past the Xanax, Cassie would rip off her seat belt, stand up in the aisle, and shout, “LAND THIS PLANE NOW! WE ARE ABOUT TO CRASH!”

> Notice that you can feel everything you just wrote down without being destroyed. Just like fight, flight, and fawn reactions, a physical and emotional collapse can be tolerated. It only gets truly unbearable if we fight it.

> (The use of one anxiety to block out another is common,

> Inner peace isn’t passive; it responds to hurt or harm calmly and intelligently. And acts of love are the only way out of the problems anxious humans have created.

> Instead, my therapist would remind me of the eight “Cs” that Schwartz identified as the characteristics of every human Self. These eight words begin with the letter c, because along with acronyms, alliteration is a fabulous tool for making things memorable. You can align with your Self by naming these values, in your mind or out loud. They are: calmness clarity confidence curiosity courage compassion connectedness creativity

> Anxiety spirals pull us away from the world. Creativity spirals pull us into it.

> According to one view of the brain developed by educators, our nervous systems are always asking three questions, in this order: Am I safe? Am I loved? What can I learn?

> Creativity spirals, on the other hand, make us focus on the here and now, where we’re able to evaluate situations and either take useful action or simply feel safe. They also impel us to learn about different perspectives and make us want to express ourselves to others. That’s love in action. Once we feel grounded in safety and connection, the brain automatically asks, What can I learn? This makes us more inventive and intelligent.

> While you’re at it, search for “birds playing” to see crows sledding on their backs down snowy hills or cockatoos making up new dance moves as they rock out to human music. I once thought reptiles, which have much more primitive brains, would know nothing of play or fun. Wrong! Turtles and lizards play, as do crocodiles and alligators, which collect any small, flowerlike pink objects as playthings and have been seen giving otters “boat rides” on their backs. Speaking of flowers, some botanists believe that plants themselves are capable of play. And if you don’t think of fungi as playful, you have never had a shaman-led mushroom journey. Fungi are indeed fun guys.

> When I asked Jill Bolte Taylor whether the right hemisphere can feel anxiety, she said, “No, because anxiety is always about the future. No time, no future, no anxiety.”

> In the case of humans, neoteny means that we never stop looking and acting like very young apes. We have the delicate bone structure, flattish faces, small teeth, and—this is the key point—curious, inquisitive, creative drive toward fun that characterizes baby apes. If we decide to develop this drive, evolution has bestowed on us the inestimably precious gift of an endless mental childhood, with all the fun and wonder that entails.

> And although humans are born with just two fears—loud noises and falling—people deliberately build very loud flying machines, then get in them and soar thousands of feet up for the express purpose of jumping out.

> Dr. Judson Brewer, a Yale-trained psychiatrist who wrote the wonderful bestseller Unwinding Anxiety, uses one simple, vowelless word to do this for some of his patients. Brewer describes running a retreat for an Olympic water polo team. He and his collaborator took the team for a hike in the Colorado mountains. They stopped at a particularly beautiful vista, and then, cued by a prearranged signal, both doctors said in unison, “Hmm!”

> As Brewer reports: When they felt frustrated or stuck…hmm seemed to help them explore what that felt like in their body and mind (instead of trying to fix or change it). When they got caught in a habit loop of worry or self-judgment, hmm could help them shift…and step out of the loop.

> The objective here is not to shame you for feeling bad but to show your nervous system a more balanced, realistic picture of your life. This kind of curious questioning can also move you into gratitude, the emotion that psychologists have found is most closely linked to happiness.

> My clients who play this game often have totally new experiences in dreaded, tediously familiar situations. When Grandma rears up to criticize someone, or Pat throws a bowl of popcorn at the televised football referee, or Alice punches a hole through the drywall, the bingo players no longer wince and clench their teeth. They lean forward, cards at the ready, thinking, Go on! Oh, please go on!

> Because anxiety shuts down all curiosity about other people, it’s also toxic to relationships. It not only makes us judge each other harshly one-on-one but also feeds into sweeping judgments about people or groups of people.

> See No Stranger, lawyer and activist Valarie Kaur writes: In brain-imaging studies, when people are shown a picture of a person of a different race…it is possible for them to dampen their unconscious fear response…. In these studies, it was as simple as wondering what they like to eat for dinner [emphasis added]. Only then does fear dissipate.

> Interest curiosity, the ability to tune into the present moment and see the truth like a Kind Detective, the ability to laugh at frustration or annoyance, the physical sensations that let us feel the difference between an anxious thought and a true one—they all rely on the brain’s right hemisphere.

> When I coached active heroin addicts, they told me they’d found their passion in life, and it was heroin. In fact, many of them said they had no other interests at all. I could tell that they believed this. But this obsession, though similar in some ways to the effects of a creative brain state, wasn’t taking them toward peace, the way a real squirrel interest does. Addicts often told me that when they weren’t high, they suffered from crippling anxiety, which they could only dull with heroin. In the process, they were losing things they valued: relationships, jobs, their own ethics.

> As I’ve coached hundreds of people, I’ve seen that finding our passions starts with a faint sensation of interest, then a slight willingness to investigate what interests us, then more curiosity, which motivates more investigation, which can ultimately grow into a lifetime’s worth of purpose.

> However you can manage it, wandering leads to wondering, and it deserves a place in your schedule. Never think that indulging your inner five-year-old’s love of an aimless romp is a waste of time. In fact, it’s one of the best ways you can go about solving your most urgent problems.

> When we challenge our minds and bodies to go beyond our ability level, the brain begins joining these long nerves, connecting more and more bits of knowledge together in a process called “far transfer.”

> It doesn’t have to be art that awakens your magician, but any art you love offers an ideal place to start building superhighways in your right hemisphere. Will Reimann is a genius at helping people do this, very consciously forcing students into situations where they need the right brain’s far transfers to gain new skills.

> WEIRD culture’s main directive (“You exist to grab stuff!”) motivates through fear and lack while draining us of purpose and joy.

> The philosopher Frederick Buechner defined vocation, or life mission, as “the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet.”

> A heart surgeon once told me, “There’s a moment where the patient’s body begins letting me know what it wants my hands to do. I have no idea how to describe that feeling, but I make damn sure I follow its instructions.”

> At some point, when you’ve gone up, then down, then away, then back into a task, you may forget to control anything at all. You may just slip into trusting the Force. And then, to adaptively paraphrase Eleanor Roosevelt, you will do things you think you cannot do—because you aren’t the one doing them. There will be no difference between you and the rest of creation. You will have come home to your selfless Self.

> As they said in China when I did research there in the 1980s: “Under capitalism, man exploits man, but under communism, it’s the other way around.”

> Weber called this “the iron cage of rationalism” and stated that it would one day suck all humans into itself, crushing their individuality. Then he went to lie down for a few years, crippled by depression, insomnia, and anxiety. In other words, he did an excellent job of foreseeing a future in which almost everyone would end up in a left hemisphere–crafted cage, then got swept up in the emotional problems typical of someone stuck in that very prison.

> Most of those jobs can’t be done while simultaneously taking care of our bodies, one another, or the earth.

> In 2005, Daniel Pink published A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future. The basic idea presented in Pink’s bestseller was that the methodical, analytical aspects of the business world would increasingly be mechanized, and that the most valuable assets in the future would be right-brain-focused qualities like the ability to play, show empathy, create meaning, design things, and tell stories. Pink’s work was criticized for oversimplifying the functions of the brain.

> You’ll be amazed at how much less frightening financial issues feel when your first focus is on living a purposeful life and earning money is subordinate to that.

> All awakened people agree that language can’t fully describe their experience, but their attempts are remarkably consistent, whatever culture they belong to.

> After decades of studying awakening from every angle I can find, I’ve come to suspect that it involves shifting identity out of a heavily left hemisphere–dominated mindset and into a worldview that grounds one’s sense of self (or “no self,” as many awakened people put it) in the right hemisphere’s perceptions.

> I believe that, like Jill, awakened people throughout history have learned to use their whole brains. But once they’ve done so, they identify with nonphysical awareness rather than with their physical bodies. And this view of the world feels much more real and reasonable than their previous way of perceiving it. They feel calm, safe, and loved by the entire universe. Everything simply makes more sense, the way our everyday lives appear after we’ve woken from scary dreams.

> That’s when I noticed that my advisers and doctors seemed to worship analytical intelligence in very much the same way my childhood community worshipped the Book of Mormon. For all their differences, the antiscience religious believers and the antireligious scientific thinkers all shared the same basic credo: “WE KNOW ALL THE THINGS!”

> When we’re fully immersed in left-hemisphere thinking, we absolutely believe whatever story we’re telling. We also want to manipulate other people into believing it with us. Religious or atheist, a mind locked on the idea that WE KNOW ALL THE THINGS is thinking dogmatically.

> Maybe we don’t know all the things.

> What he actually wrote was: “We cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt.” He then concluded: “Dubito, ergo sum, vel, quod idem est, cogito, ergo sum” (I doubt, therefore I am—or, what is the same—I think, therefore I am). It was doubt, not thought, that formed the foundation of Descartes’s reality.

> But these Asian sages used the term “enlightenment” to describe the release of all fixed ideas.

> The road to waking up is paved not with new knowledge but with unknowing—really knowing how deeply we don’t know things, like what reality actually is. We start down this road by accepting not-knowing as a fundamental quality of being human.

> It wasn’t thinking about doubt that helped Newberg begin to wake up; it was becoming the consciousness in which doubt occurs.

> Since then, Dinah has lived according to a phrase she heard in a yoga class: “I exist in continuous creative response to whatever is present.” This is the way of life that arises when we accept that we don’t really know much, and what we do think we know may be false.

> Now, I couldn’t have deliberately forced that blue jay to calm down, any more than I can heal the fears of everyone in this anxious world. What I can do is kindly extricate myself from anxiety, turn to curiosity and connection, and become an intentional, focused point of consciousness in the sea of creation.

> Now: Can I imagine the stillness in which all activity occurs? Repeat.
*> *Note:** 52 bodies. Small dance

> The mind that excludes can’t handle what we actually are. Only the mind that includes can hold the paradoxes of being. When we embrace don’t-know mind, we can find ourselves as drops of consciousness existing beyond space and time, and as small physical creatures who are inching closer to death even as you read this.

> But as I believe we’ve established, anxiety feels like hammered crap. You can use that suffering as motivation to relax, breathe, and ask yourself, Can I imagine the space, silence, and stillness I share with everything? In other words, you can use that suffering to return to peace. To awaken, moment by moment.

> Psychologists Dan Grupe and Jack Nitschke called anxiety “aberrant and excessive anticipatory responding under conditions of threat uncertainty.” In other words, it’s the terror of imaginary monsters in an imaginary future that may never happen.

> Keep up the KIST until you can access Self-energy—enough of it to begin breathing more easily and feeling your muscles loosen a bit. This will put you back in touch with what you innately are: a consciousness that is calm, clear, confident, curious, courageous, compassionate, connected, and creative.

> The moment we begin to observe and wonder about what’s happening to us, we trigger curiosity, which leads to courage and connection. We regain that critical mass of Self. Then we can use our imaginations, not to tell horrifying stories but to transform challenging situations into catalysts for creativity.

> Just as anxiety is the end product of a paranoid imagination, inspiration is the end product of a creative imagination. When we allow ourselves to be inspired, our minds relax out of anxiety, choosing to focus on possibilities that nourish our souls.

> Drop false humility and be inspired by your own capacity to step up and embody your best Self. You are an extraordinarily brave human doing your best to navigate a difficult world. That’s inspiring.

> The only answer I get, tossed out by my right hemisphere (which, you may recall, uses language mainly for jokes, songs, and poetry), comes from T. S. Eliot’s poem “East Coker.” He writes, “I said to my soul, be still,” specifying that his soul must wait without hope, love, faith, or even thinking. “Wait without thought,” Eliot says, “for you are not ready for thought.”

> Feel what’s working in you, through you, for you. This is lila, the play of consciousness as it takes on matter, forms itself into beings, and then leaves them again. It is consciousness playing in the field of matter, dancing with human bodies more beautifully than they know how to dance.
