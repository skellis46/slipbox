# Sacasas - Too Many Words, and Not Enough

_previous note:_ [[Sacasas - The Virtue of Noticing]]

> am reminded of Arendt’s discussion of a [common sense and a common world](https://substack.com/redirect/f4e1d56f-fc65-4f41-8c05-8ea37641a6e6?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) .
>  “Only the experience of sharing a common human world with others who look at it from different perspectives,” Arendt argued, “can enable us to see reality in the round and to develop a shared common sense.”
>  Common sense, in this view, is common because it is the bearing down of my senses and yours upon a shared world that is materially present to us. And this sense we hold in common has important epistemic consequences. “The presence of others who see what we see and hear what we hear,” she believed, “assures us of the reality of the world and ourselves.”
>  Thus, “a noticeable decrease in common sense in any given community and a noticeable increase in superstition and gullibility are therefore almost infallible signs of alienation from the world.”
>  The difference between what Arendt describes and what we experience, however, is that we have not retreated into a private subjective realm. Rather, we have retreated, if that’s the right word, into bespoke, hyper-mediated experiences of reality. And these experiences are constantly shifting and changing. They lack the stability and the materially public quality necessary to ground a common sense and, consequently, a common language.

- very useful for [[research centre for body and presence]] -- that I'm kind of proposing an antidote to this. 

> **6.** In the *Pensées* , Pascal observed that “there are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason.” With regard to language, we might say that there are two analogous extremes: to exclude the possibility that language can adequately express something truthful about the world, to admit only the truths language can convey. I would assent to the claim that there are truths beyond language. There are inexpressible realities and ineffable experiences. But language is itself a miracle and a gift of extraordinary range, power, and beauty. It is one thing to reach the limits of language by testing its resources and searching its depths, and another thing altogether to mistake our own apathy and incuriosity for the inherent limits of speech.

> There is a certain risk worth considering, and that is that words themselves can become veil over the world. Perhaps one way of putting this, if I may improvise a distinction, is to say that words become mere labels. ² Rather than invite the encounter, they halt it. I suppose this is where the idea of attending to the world comes in. The work of attention, as Murdoch, and Simone Weil before her, have argued, must be continuous and ongoing. If we conceive of the relationship between speech and the world as a matter of discrete once-and-done transactions, especially if we do so in a strictly instrumental manner, then speech may very well darken rather than illuminate the world for us. On the other hand, if we inject the concept of attention into the matter ³ , then we will be more likely to keep our words alive and refreshed by the practice of persistently attending to the world in humility, in expectation of the unexpected gift.

> **8.** There is a risk that all of this may come off as elitist or overly academic, but that is not at all how I intend it. I remember an older gentleman for whom I worked when I was a teenager. He had grown up in North Carolina during the Depression—dirt poor, as they say. No one would mistake him for an academic or an elite of any sort. In my adolescence, I was amused by the colorful expressions, vibrant similes, and striking images that colored his speech. It all seemed very quaint and archaic. But now I realize that while his words were not elegant, they were alive. And they were alive because they had been drawn from a proximity to soil and beast that most of us now lack. Neither is this a matter of what one might have once called bookish learning. While writing and print certainly help grow the lexicon extensively, my contention here has been that the most important factor is not formal learning at all, but rather something like a disposition (and the [capability](https://substack.com/redirect/e5d5d2c5-26bd-4797-8483-776e3873414b?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) ) to encounter the world with the full range of our bodily senses. The body is the anchor of language in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz905x0n1k5yns18bf9fdbrc))
