# Foster - Taken by Surprise

_previous note:_

> Within the meager discourses describing the experience of improvisation that
history has left us, the terms mind and body often stand in for the known and
the unknown. We read of improvisation as the process of letting go of the
mind's thinking so that the body can do its moving in its own unpredictable
way. But this description is an obfuscation, as unhelpful as it is inaccurate;
surely, all bodily articulation is mindful. Each body segment's sweep across
space, whether direct or meandering, is thought-filled. Each corporeal modula[p.7]tion in effort thinks; each swelling into tension thinks; each erratic burst or undulation in energy thinks. Each accented phrasing or accelerating torque or momentary stillness is an instance of thought. Conceptualized in this way, bodily action constitutes a genre of discourse. [@foster-2003-taken pp.6-7]

- this writing is a sleight of hand. Why no citations? the switch between mind, mindful and thoughts. Even what the hell she means by 'thinking', and then the switch from thought to discourse. But the main one is from 'mind body' to 'mindful' -- although I get the etymologic weirdness of the word 'mindful', it seems disingenuous to perform this shift because mind and 'mindful' are different in kind in how the words are used in english.

> improvisation pivots both mind and body into a new apprehension of relationalities. [@foster-2003-takena p.7]
