# Heather Houser - Human / Planetary

_previous note:_ [[the present is usually illegible to itself]]

Heather Houser is a Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin. She writes on contemporary culture, the environment and science with a special interest in the ways in which scientific data are presented and represented as art.

_Human / Planetary_ is a book chapter in which Houser writes about climate modelling as an [[inhuman mediation of human and planetary time]].

> Human biological and planetary rhythms partially harmonize around seasonality, but technological interventions—from the factory clock to the electric light bulb—have increasingly moved humanity out of temporal alignment with the nonhuman. And yet human time and “nonhuman” technological time are not tidy synonyms either. Rather, a third term—the inhuman time of instrumentation, computation, and mathematicization—mediates the entrenched binary of human and planetary time. Inhuman time widens the cognitive and affective gap between humans and the geophysical and ecological processes to which we would be fully subject without machine aids.[@houser-2016-human p.144]

Among other things the chapter is a concise and fantastic overview of the Anthropocene.

> How might climate change media conceptualize humanity in terms of the planetary or block that correspondence? I argue that a third temporal form, that encoded in inhuman devices, mediates the dance between human and planet. Inhuman time variously jams this ontological distinction or enforces human exceptionalism.[@houser-2016-human p.147]

> Carbon calculators, for example, are overtly commercial and put climate threat directly into the wallets of individuals, businesses, and municipalities in their roles as consumers and emitters. Calculators body forth the species _homo economicus_. This living being drains fossil fuel reserves and threatens human and nonhuman species survival, but the calculators primarily emphasize users’ contributions to GHGs as a drain on fiscal reserves. Doing so, they rescale and familiarize climate change, defying environmental critics’ widespread evaluation that “[a]ny phenomenology of climate change . . . inheres in an eerie disconnection from sensate experience.”18 Might carbon calculators make climate threat sense-able by quantifying it in the dollars and cents that fuel households, businesses, and governments rather than the datasets that fuel climatological research and modeling?

- this idea of an 'eerie disconnection from sensate experience' is just remarkable, particularly for [[footfall]]
