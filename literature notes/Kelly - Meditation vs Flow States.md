- [[flow]]
- [[namtok and the thought machine]]

SH: What's the connection between an insight into selflessness and a conventional flow state? People have these experiences, as you say, often while moving, often during athletics or in nature, where they feel that suddenly there's no distance between them and their experience. They're not looking over their own shoulder at their experience, telling themselves the story of how good this is. They're fully unified.

00:29
with the experience for a time, usually a brief time, and then they start telling themselves how good this is or how good it was or how can I get more of this or ... 

LK: How can I come back next year and do the same thing, but I don't have a vacation, so I'll never be able to do it. 

SH: Right, exactly. 	

LK: So this is what we're doing is saying like. 

SH: Yeah, why can't my life be more like this? And maybe we should move to Montana. 

LK: That's right. 

SH: Then the namtok machine starts up. Namtok is the Tibetan word for thought. There's that experience of sort of unity 

00:56
and then they lose it and then they associate it with that experience, whatever it is, you know, being in nature or being athletic. Whereas non-dual mindfulness or this insight into selflessness is something that can happen in the midst of any experience on demand. And it contains this understanding of the mechanics of its own arising. I mean, you see how it gets obscured by thought and you can cease to

01:24
let that happen in the next moment. And so there's a kind of a metacognition here that is lacking in flow states. I mean, flow just sort of happens to you and you sort of have to wait for it to happen the next time. And you just got to keep putting yourself in that position where you hope it's going to happen. And it does happen by virtue of pain, of having something happening in the present moment that's so compelling that you effortlessly grant a hundred percent of your attention to it.

01:53
So it's a kind of a concentration state too. 

LK: Well, I divided into two and I'll probably need to write a little paper on this is that what I call absorbed flow and panoramic flow. And they're always talked about as if they're one thing, but they're actually two. Is that absorbed flow, you literally are in almost a Jhana absorbed concentration where you are so involved in a task that everything else is gone and you look up and two hours have gone by.

02:23
And a panoramic is more like an athletic or being in the wood walking in the woods, you feel everything ... your time slows down, you're in the now, you know, you're not in your ego, your ego is dropped away, you feel connected to everyone and everything around you. And if you would look back at that time to see, well, you know, is there in my operating from my small self what? Where is that

02:52
point of view? Is there a point of view that I'm aware from? You would immediately find ... that's what I'm saying ... people get into it, but they don't use the metacognition to look back. And if they did, or if they knew that that was kind of the result of that, then you then that's kind of what I'm interested in doing is using that example. Now say, Okay, what if you could do that anytime of the day through small glimpses ...

03:21
no matter what you're doing, whether you're sitting on a subway or in a, in your office or, and you could literally feel the way that you're planning your next vacation, you know, six months from now to do ... like, what if this were your natural condition? And it's just another, it's not about the external conditions. It's about those external conditions support you letting go. But what you discover is

03:50
is that which you already are that's here and you can learn to shift into that and then everything's like a beautiful forest and mountain stream and athletic game. [@kelly-nodate-meditation n.pag.]
