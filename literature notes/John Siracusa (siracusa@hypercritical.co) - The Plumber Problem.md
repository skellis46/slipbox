## Highlights

> “The Plumber Problem” is a phrase I coined to describe the experience of watching a movie that touches on on some subject area that you know way more about than the average person, and then some inaccuracy in what’s depicted distracts you and takes you out of the movie. (This can occur in any work of fiction, of course: movies, TV, books, etc.)
>  Here’s an example. A plumber is watching a movie with a scene where something having to do with pipes is integral to the plot. But it’s all wrong, and the plumber’s mind rebels. No one else in the audience is bothered. They’re all still wrapped up in the narrative. But the plumber has a problem.
>  I'm not sure how long ago I came up with this phrase. The earliest recorded occurrence I can find is from 2021, in [episode #153 of Reconcilable Differences](https://www.relay.fm/rd/153) ([at 47:02](https://overcast.fm/+E5IOGS27o/47:02)) where I explain it to my cohost, [Merlin](http://www.merlinmann.com), so it obviously predates that.
