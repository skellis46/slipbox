# Chad Robertson - Bread Book Ideas and Innovations From the Future of Grain, Flour, and Fermentation

_previous note:_ [[L. M. Sacasas - Baking Bread, Finding Meaning]]

> Now here’s the kind of magical part: I need the total flour weight so I can calculate all of the rest of the ingredients in relation to it. In order to get that number, I simply divide the total dough weight by the total percentage. So, total dough ÷ total percentage = total flour. You have to factor that as a percentage, and place the decimal point accordingly, to the left of the last two digits.


> Country bread is mixed gently and slowly for a few minutes at a time with frequent periods of rest. This approach gradually facilitates the physical process that coaxes the flour into becoming dough. Vigorous kneading forces the gluten to form quickly but results in bread that is both less tender and less long-lasting.

> Loosely cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let rest in a warm (82° to 85°F), draft-free place for about 3 hours from the time you added the leaven to the dough. Every 30 minutes, wet your hands and give the dough several series of turns in the bowl, using the same gentle lifting, stretching, and folding technique you used when mixing the dough. This builds strong gluten bonds in the dough without deflating it. The last turn should be a gentle one, turning the dough just until it has all been gently folded over once; the mass should hold its shape in the bowl.

> As noted, you need a constant dough temperature of between 82° and 85°F to accomplish the bulk fermentation in 3 hours, starting from the time you mixed in the leaven.

> Other recipes use these variations to elicit certain characteristics in breads, but between 82° and 85°F is the ideal temperature range for our country bread.
