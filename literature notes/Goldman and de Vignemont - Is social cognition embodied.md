# Goldman and de Vignemont - Is social cognition embodied?

- URL: https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/78286818

## Highlights

> We offer
>  several interpretations of embodiment, the most inter-
>  esting being the thesis that mental representations in
>  bodily formats (B-formats) have an important role in
>  cognition. Potential B-formats include motoric, somato-
>  sensory, affective and interoceptive formats. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4bc0werym3s9nmf6t4jy1))

> A spectre is haunting the laboratories of cognitive science,
>  the spectre of embodied cognition (EC). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4jz4k4k542s64qyrew5f2))

> Embodiment theorists want to elevate the
>  importance of the body in explaining cognitive activities.
>  What is meant by ‘body’ here? It ought to mean: the whole
>  physical body minus the brain. Letting the brain qualify as
>  part of the body would trivialize the claim that the body is
>  crucial to mental life, simply because the brain is the seat
>  of most, if not all, mental events. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4jdav0perbnffwhwsffwa))

> However, embodiment seems to
>  mean widely different things to different EC theorists, and
>  their views range from the radical to the not so radical. In
>  view of this diversity, it is impossible to canvass all
>  varieties of EC (for review see Ref. [13]). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4n72vd2yywmy04tqk78n8))

> We shall formulate four deﬁnitions or conceptions ofembo- diment (Figure 1). Because many pre-existing formu- lations of embodiment are rather opaque, we hope that our proposals will bring increased clarity to this matter. For any conception of embodiment, of course, it could be claimed that ‘all’ of cognition is embodied, or that ‘90%’ of cognition is embodied, etc. Nobody is in a position to address this quantiﬁcational issue with any precision and we shall leave this question open here, merely assum- ing that EC theses want embodiment to have, at least, an ‘important’ role.
