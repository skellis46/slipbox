# Barbour: Beyond “Somatophobia”: Phenomenology and Movement Research in Dance

_previous note:_

## LLM summary 

Karen Barbour’s 2005 article _Beyond “Somatophobia”: Phenomenology and Movement Research in Dance_ argues for phenomenological and feminist methodologies that foreground lived movement experience as a valid form of knowledge. Drawing on phenomenologists such as Merleau-Ponty and feminist theorists including Iris Marion Young and Elizabeth Grosz, Barbour critiques Western “somatophobia” — the cultural fear and repression of the body — and outlines how phenomenology reclaims the body as central to understanding. She reviews feminist dance researchers like Sandra Fraleigh, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, Susan Stinson and Ruth Way, emphasising first-person accounts that honour the dancer’s voice. Barbour proposes three complementary research methods — interviewing, creative journaling and dance making — to explore embodied ways of knowing. The article concludes with a narrative conversation among women dance makers in Aotearoa New Zealand, illustrating how phenomenological research can reveal embodied, relational and feminist understandings of knowledge through movement.

> Lived experiences are immediate and pre-reflective. Integral to lived experience is the notion of the “lived body”: a non-dualistic understanding of the conscious, intentional, and unified body, soul and mind in action in the world. [@barbour-2005-somatophobia p.35]

Curious here about the non-dualistic. Contradicts
