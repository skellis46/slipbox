# Harris - Ego and illusion (audio recording)


_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

00:00
Is it possible to understand that the ego is an illusion without actually experiencing it? Absolutely. In fact, that's far more common. You can understand that the ego is an illusion, or put another way, that it can't be what it seems, very simply. You can understand it logically, neurologically. It's a little bit like the notion of free will. You can't quite make sense of it.

00:30
First, neurologically, as I've said many times before, there is no place in the human brain where the ego can be hiding. There's no place in the brain where everything comes together. There's no time where it all comes together, really. Even our perception of the present moment must be a series of layered memories and information that has been essentially buffered before being delivered to consciousness.

01:00
So if you see your hand in front of you and you snap your fingers, we know that the visual data are arriving at the cortex earlier than the haptic or touch-related data. The transit time through the nerves up your arm to your cortex is longer than through the optic nerve, and yet we don't detect any disparity there. But more generally, ...

01:29
... your mental experience of the world is a process. It is not a static something. So the experience of being a self, an ego, in the middle of all of these changing neurophysiological states, it too must be a process. It's a verb, it's not a noun. You are selfing your experience. You are not a self ...

01:59
standing in the middle of experience. Self is a kind of action. It's the act of identifying. It's the act of grasping. And it's an action that can be interrupted. It's an action that can be relinquished. Right, and this is an empirical fact. You can discover this for yourself, and meditation is the technique whereby you would do that, or at least one of them. But you can understand intellectually how it can't be ...

02:28
what it seems to be. Another route in, apart from the underlying neurology, is the logical one with respect to the nature of consciousness. If everything that we experience must arise in consciousness to be experienced, if every sight, sound, sensation, emotion must appear in the space of awareness to be known. And I think that is almost

02:58
tautologically true, what we mean by consciousness is the fact that things are experienced. So if the self is experienced in any way at all, if it has any empirical signature, if there's anything by which it can be noticed, well that thing must be an appearance in consciousness. It must be a kind of object for consciousness. Consciousness therefore must be prior to it. Consciousness can't be ... 

03:26
truly defined by it. Any object you notice in consciousness, like a sight or a sound, can't entirely subsume what consciousness is, right? It's an object for it. Consciousness is the condition in which it appears. Now that may sound dualistic, and as many of you know ultimately I believe consciousness is, as a matter of experience, non-dualistic, but let's leave that aside for the moment. Whatever the sense of self is, as a feeling, ...

03:57
is being known by this prior fact of consciousness. So it would make sense if consciousness itself were not truly identical to this feeling of self, which is yet another object arising to be known. And again, all of this can be experienced. You can directly notice that consciousness doesn't feel like what you're calling I. It doesn't feel like an ego. It doesn't feel like a self.

04:26
You can look for this sense of self and fail to find it in a way that is entirely compelling. The question was, is it possible to understand that this might be so without actually having this compelling experience? Another way to recognize it is more or less of a piece with all the considerations I've given about free will in my books and in the Waking Up course. So, I mean, what does this sense of self entail?

04:55
How far does it reach? Let's say you feel it now, you're the ego riding around in your head, that enjoys free will, presumably. Well, what can you do? Can you not hear my voice now? Can you actually withdraw your hearing and put it somewhere else? Can you not understand these words? If you speak English, you will helplessly decode each word as I speak it.

05:25
You have no idea how you do that. You can't not do it. Can you choose the next thought that arises in consciousness? Well, no, you can't even do that, right? It might feel like you've done it because you're identified with this thought as it appears in consciousness. But if you pay closer attention, you'll see that you can't decide what you think or intend or desire. And if suddenly you ...

05:54
seem to go against the grain of what you think, intend, and desire in the next moment. You decide to execute a veto of sorts. Well, where did that come from? Were you upstream from that? Not as a conscious ego you weren't. The self you think you have is on the receiving end of everything. It's the last to know what it's going to do. You know, that verges on a kind of meditation ...

06:24
to look very closely there in that way. But conceptually, it also delivers the point. If you can't find anything for this ego to do, right, all the things it thinks it's doing, it's not doing. So in what sense is it even there? Anyway, there are many other considerations that are conceptual, that undermine this notion of an ego. There are many within Buddhism in particular that undermine ...

06:54
the notion of any intrinsically existing thing. It's not just egos that don't exist, but by this measure, no independent thing exists in and of itself. Everything is a set of relationships. Right, when you think about a car, what is a car? Well, a car is a relationship among car parts, but none of the parts carry their car-ness in them. You know, a door ...

07:23
is not a car, and it doesn't have car-ness. It's a door, which itself can be broken into smaller elements. So does a car exist without a door and without wheels and without a windshield? Well you take away enough parts, it ceases to be a car. And when you combine the right parts, suddenly a car emerges, but a car again is a pattern of relationships. There's no car essence.

07:52
There's no one place in the car where it all comes together. There's no ego for the car. And that's true for anything else you want to point to in the natural world or in the artificial world. What we see are sets of relationships that have functional properties. And if the self is that sort of thing, if the self is just a set of relationships among processes and structures that are continually changing and eroding ...

08:22
and being replaced, some of which are conscious, some of which aren't. Well, that's not the self that people feel they have. That's not the ego that wakes up every morning thinking it's the same person. This pristine, unchanging center of consciousness that is the thinker of thoughts and the experiencer of experience, that cognitive and emotional homunculus can't be found and doesn't make logical sense.
