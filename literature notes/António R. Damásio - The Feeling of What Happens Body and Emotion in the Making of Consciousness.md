## Highlights
- Emotions are inseparable from the idea of reward or punishment, of pleasure or pain, of approach or withdrawal, of personal advantage and disadvantage. Inevitably, emotions are inseparable from the idea of good and evil. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpevsectt9wk7etf3x9ctbvj))
- The pervasiveness of emotion in our development and subsequently in our everyday experience connects virtually every object or situation in our experience, by virtue of conditioning, to the fundamental values of homeostatic regulation: reward and punishment; pleasure or pain; approach or withdrawal; personal advantage or disadvantage; and, inevitably, good (in the sense of survival) or evil (in the sense of death). Whether we like it or not, this is the natural human condition. But when consciousness is available, feelings have their maximum impact, and individuals are also able to reflect and to plan. They have a means to control the pervasive tyranny of emotion: it is called reason. Ironically, of course, the engines of reason still require emotion, which means that the controlling power of reason is often modest.

- You make those attributions purely on the basis of the movements of the organism, the speed of each act, the number of acts per unit of time, the style of the movements, and so on. You can do the same thing with a simple chip moving about on a computer screen. Some jagged fast movements will appear "angry," harmonious but explosive jumps will look "joyous," recoiling motions will look "fearful." A video that depicts several geometric shapes moving about at different rates and holding varied relationships reliably elicits attributions of emotional state from normal adults and even children. The reason why you can anthropomorphize the chip or an animal so effectively is simple: emotion, as the word indicates, is about movement, about externalized behavior, about certain orchestrations of reactions to a given cause, within a given environment.

- To the degree that Aplysia can represent its emotive state in the nervous system, it may have the makings of a feeling. We do not know whether Aplysia has feelings or not, but it is extremely difficult to imagine that Aplysia would know of such feelings if it does have them.

- There would have been, however, unmistakable wakefulness: the eyes would have been open; muscle tone, maintained. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpev55xyr66yhmwps62bxh3a))
    - Note: The phrase unmistakable wakefulness really appeals to me. Title?
- Observing an episode of absence automatism you would have watched the elaborate behaviors of an organism deprived of all extended consciousness and of everything but perhaps the dimmest form of core consciousness. One can only try to imagine the remains of a mind from which self and knowing have been removed, perhaps a mind strewn with images of things to be known but never really known, with things not really owned—stripped of the engine for deliberate action.

- venture that absence of emotion is a reliable correlate of defective core consciousness, perhaps as much as the presence of some degree of continuous emoting is virtually always associated with the conscious state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpevcrra5ysjd6b85wz3fqws))

> Specifically, in the example above, it is a process that interrelates neural patterns of tissue damage with the neural patterns that stand for you, such that yet another neural pattern can arise—the neural pattern of you knowing, which is just another name for consciousness. If the latter interrelating process does not take place, you will never know that there was tissue damage in your organism—if there is no you and there is no knowing, there is no way for you to know, right?

> Based on what we know about private human minds and on what we know and can observe of human behavior, it is possible to establish a three-way link among: (1) certain external manifestations, e.g., wakefulness, background emotions, attention, specific behaviors; (2) the corresponding internal manifestations of the human being having those behaviors as reported by that human being; and (3) the internal manifestations that we, as observers, can verify in ourselves when we are in circumstances equivalent to those of the observed individual. This three-way linkage authorizes us to make reasonable inferences about human private states based on external behavior.

> Curiously, compared with the specialists, the popular culture seems to have fewer problems with the private perspective of consciousness, as shown brilliantly in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry. Perhaps you have seen the film, but if not, here is my report on what happens. In the middle of a movie-within-a-movie scene, which describes the shooting of a film scene, the cameraman realizes that the image of the actor he is filming is fuzzy. Naturally, he first attributes the problem to his own error in controlling the focus, and after he fails to correct it, he begins worrying that the focusing mechanism may be out of order. But the mechanism is fine, and since there is no improvement, the cameraman now worries about the state of the lens. Could it be dirty and so cause the fuzziness? Yet, the lens turns out to be fine, too, and perfectly clean. In the midst of the ensuing commotion, everyone suddenly realizes that the problem does not have anything to do with the camera at all but with the actor in question (Mel, played by Robin Williams). It is the actor himself who is out of focus! He is intrinsically fuzzy, and everyone looking at him sees a blurred image; everyone looking at anything else but Mel sees a clear image.

> The contents of those thoughts, and there are usually parallel and simultaneous contents, include objects with which the organism is actually engaged or objects recalled from memory as well as feelings of the emotions that have just occurred. In turn, many of these "streams" of thought—of actual objects, of recalled objects, and of feelings—can induce emotions, from background to secondary, with or without our cognizance. The continuous exhibition of emotion derives from this overabundance of inducers, known and not known, simple and not so simple.

> The contents that make up a conscious mind would have been missing, and this could no more lead to a verbal report than to a highly intelligent action. He would have remained awake and attentive enough to process the object that came next into his perceptual purview, but inasmuch as we can deduce from the situation, that is all that would go on in the mind. There would have been no plan, no forethought, no sense of an individual organism wishing, wanting, considering, believing. There would have been no sense of self, no identifiable person with a past and an anticipated future—specifically, no core self and no autobiographical self.

> Core Consciousness —--=> 105 and its living model who was sitting across from him, only a few feet away; no connection made to me, either, who had actually made the photograph ten years before, at a time of shared joy. The folding and unfolding of the photograph had happened regularly, from earlier in the progress of the disease, when he still knew that something was amiss, perhaps as a desperate attempt to cling to the certainty of what once was. Now it had become an unconscious ritual, performed with the same slow pace, in the same silence, with the same lack of affective resonance. In the sadness of the moment I was happy that he no longer could know. reflection on these instances of disturbed consciousness reveals the following facts: First, there is a sharp separation between, on the one hand, wakefulness, low-level attention, and brief, adequate behaviors, which can survive the disturbance of consciousness, and, on the other, emotion, which is lost along with the sense of knowing and self. The defect of knowing and self and of recognizably motivated emotion goes hand in hand with defects in planning, in high-level attention, and in sustained and adequate behaviors. The decoupling of functions that we can observe in these cases exposes a layering of subcomponents which would have been difficult to notice, let alone tease apart, without the scalpel provided by neurological disease. Second, for practical purposes we can classify the neurological examples of disrupted core consciousness as follows: A. Disruption of core consciousness with preserved wakefulness and preserved minimal attentionjbehavior. The prime examples are akinetic mutisms and epileptic automatisms. Akinetic mutisms are caused by dysfunction in the cingulate cortex, in the basal forebrain, in the thalamus, and in the medial, peri-cingulate parietal cortex. B. Disruption of core consciousness with preserved wakefulness but defective minimal attention J behavior. Absence seizures and persistent vegetative ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqm1hgha8xvde45gxb5mebvp))

> Language is a major contributor to the high-level form of consciousness which we are using at this very moment, and which I call extended consciousness. Because of this, it does require a major effort to imagine what lies behind language, but the effort must be made. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqm1k46jwy53vrp8dz96jmb6))


> His mind is like ours in the sense that it has images of varied sensory modalities, that those images occur in coordinated and logically interconnected sets, that those sets change over time in a forward direction, and that new sets succeed the preceding ones. David has a stream of such image sets, the kind of process that Shakespeare and Joyce converted in literary form in their soliloquies, and that William James named a stream of consciousness. But the content in the images within David's stream of consciousness is a different matter. We know for certain that his images embody the general rather than the particular—general knowledge about the stimuli we show him and general knowledge about his person, about his body, about his current physical and mental states, about his likes and dislikes. Unlike us, David can never conjure up the specifics of unique things, persons, places, or events. Whereas you or I will inevitably mix, at every turn, images of general knowledge with images of unique knowledge, David is obliged to stay within the general. David's mind differs from ours in the specificity of its contents. I suspect it also differs in the quantity of images. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gqm1njvc0m8w6fek3a3qwj33))


> The fact that core consciousness is separable from other cognitive processes does not mean that consciousness does not have an influence on them. On the contrary, as explained in chapter 6, core consciousness has a major influence on those other cognitive processes. Core consciousness focuses and enhances attention and working memory; core consciousness favors establishment of memories; core consciousness is indispensable for the normal operations of language; and core consciousness enlarges the scope of the intelligent manipulations we call planning, problem solving, and creativity. In conclusion, individuals such as we are, endowed with extensive memory and intelligence, can manipulate facts logically, with or

> We can infer that the thoughts in our minds are created in our individual perspective; that we own them; that we can act on them; that the apparent protagonist of the relationship with the object is our organism. As I see it, however, core consciousness begins before those inferences: it is the very evidence, the unvarnished sense of our individual organism in the act of knowing. All the cognitive properties discussed above have been potentiated by core consciousness and have, in turn, helped build extended consciousness on the foundation of core consciousness.

> In the opening chapter of this book, I suggested that core consciousness includes an inner sense based on images. I also suggested that the particular images are those of a feeling. That inner sense conveys a powerful nonverbal message regarding the relationship between the organism and the object: that there is an individual subject in the relationship, a transiently constructed entity to which the knowledge of the moment is seemingly attributed. Implicit in the message is the idea that the images of any given object that are now being processed are formed in our individual perspective, that we are the owners of the thought process, and that we can act on the contents of the thought process.

> The view of consciousness I adopt here connects historically with those expressed by thinkers as diverse as Locke, Brentano, Kant, Freud, and William James. They believed as I do that consciousness is "an inner sense." Curiously, the "inner sense" view is no longer mainstream in consciousness studies.3 In the view I adopt here, consciousness also conforms to the fundamental properties William James outlined for it: It is selective; it is continuous; it pertains to objects other than itself; it is personal. James did not make a distinction between core and extended kinds of consciousness, but that turns out not to pose a problem because the properties he proposed easily apply to both kinds of consciousness.
