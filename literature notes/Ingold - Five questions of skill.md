# Tim Ingold - Five questions of skill

_previous note:_ [[flow and nonduality]]

In **Tim Ingold’s** short essay *“Five Questions of Skill”* (Cultural Geographies 25(1):159–163), he reframes how we understand skill not as a secondary, bodily-confined adjunct to cognition but as a fundamental, situated way of knowing. Ingold takes as given the critique that traditional views treat skill as imitation or automatic response disconnected from thought. Drawing on literature in human geography, anthropology, and sociology, he argues that skill is *ontogenetically* and *ecologically* constituted: it arises through a practitioner’s ongoing engagement with the environment, shaped by perceptual-motor attunement over time. Skilled practice is thus both bodily and mental, inseparable from the world in which it unfolds, and entails creativity, responsiveness, and improvisation rather than rote execution.

Ingold’s framing reframes five key, implicit questions about what skill *is*, how it *develops*, how it *relates to knowledge*, how it *manifests in practice*, and what it *reveals about human-environment relations*. Although he does not list these as discrete questions in the text, the essay prompts readers to interrogate assumptions about skill being innate or solely bodily, and to see skill as a dynamic interplay of perception, action, and environment. By foregrounding the subtle complexity of attunement and creative responsiveness in skilled practice, Ingold positions skill as foundational to all forms of human engagement with the world, from craftwork to everyday actions, dissolving rigid binaries between mind and body, cognition and technique.
