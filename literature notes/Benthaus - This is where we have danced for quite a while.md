# Benthaus - This is where we have danced for quite a while

> When it comes to screendance practices, [McPherson] asks, “An unexpected legacy of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic may be that screendance becomes more visible, shifting if not into the limelight, then perhaps at least out of the shadows?”6 Riffing off Douglas Rosenberg’s observation, made in an unpublished talk at Stanford University, that screendance is not new, but has been “’hiding in plain site,”7 she later notes that “a frequent hiding place for screendance are music videos…”8 @benthaus-2021-this p.282]

> As someone who has grown up on musical films, dance films, and music videos (on MTV and later on YouTube when it was launched in 2005), as well as moved alongside social media dances, my thinking-moving body, made, unmade, and remade by popular screendance11 over many, many years feels a bit wary of the idea that screendance has been hiding in, or under something or other until Covid-19 lockdown life has chased away the shadows in which it has been hiding. I would say that the limelight has been on it for quite a while, at least for a particular style/genre of screendance and its participant-viewership. The public has been interacting and playing with popular screendance media like music videos since at least the early 1980s when MTV was launched.[@benthaus-2021-this p.283]


> The public has been interacting and playing with popular screendance media like music videos since at least the early 1980s when MTV was launched.12 They have watched (and also made) amateur dance covers of music videos13 and commercial dance class videos on YouTube.14 Viral dances and dance fads have been created, popularized, and appropriated (with and without credit15) on social media platforms such as Vine, between 2013 when the app was launched and 2017 when it was closed (RIP), Instagram (launched in 2010), and now, of course, TikTok (originally launched in China in 2016, but becoming more globally popular and accessible since 2017/2018). But before all that social media dance hype and before even music videos became a thing, dance fads were not only circulated by Hollywood musicals and dance films, but also especially via early music television shows such as American Bandstand (1952-1989) and Soul Train (1971-2006).16 For example, I learned from John Waters’ 1988 musical film Hairspray that teens have danced along their television sets broadcasting these shows since they started airing “in plain site.”[@benthaus-2021-this p.283]

- useful summary of social dance online.

> It made me think of popular dance scholar Sherril Dodds’ observation that, “whether we speak our politics blatantly or live them quietly through how we move in the world, we take a position on the screendance that surrounds us: we choose what, how, where, when, and why we watch.”20[@benthaus-2021-this p.284]

- except I suspect those two people were not taking a position. A position was being taken on them. They were being technopolised. 
- To make claims regarding the politics of exclusion/inclusion is tricky given that the only 'people' who really benefit are corporations.
