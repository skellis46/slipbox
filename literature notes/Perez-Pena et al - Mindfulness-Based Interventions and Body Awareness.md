# Perez-Pena et al - Mindfulness-Based Interventions and Body Awareness

_previous note:_

Study on efficacy of a mindfulness programme on body awareness. "One of the theorized working mechanisms by which MBIs exert their positive effects is by improving body awareness." [@perez-pena-2022-mindfulnessbased p.1]

Excellent overview of literature on body awareness, interoception and proprioception.
