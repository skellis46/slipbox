# Garfield - Losing Ourselves: Learning to Live without a Self

> Candrakīrti (c. 600–650 CE) introduces us to the target of any critique of the idea of the self. He argues that it is important to keep that target clearly in view, and that it is important not to confuse it with other ideas in the conceptual neighborhood. Candrakīrti tells the story of a man who is afraid that a poisonous snake has taken up residence in one of the walls of his house. In order to alleviate his fear, the man searches the house for an elephant, and satisfies himself that there is none there. He then rests at ease.

> The Indian classic *Bhagavad Gītā (Song of the Lord)* characterizes the relation between the self and the embodied person as akin to that between you and your wardrobe. Each day you might put on a new set of clothes, but you are still you, the bearer of those clothes; you are not in any sense identical to them, and you are the same individual who put on different clothes yesterday and who may put on new ones tomorrow. Just so, according to the *Gītā,* you, the *ātman,* put on a new mind and body in each life, but are never identical to any mind or body; instead, you are the *bearer* of that mind and body, which are just as much objects to your subjectivity as any external phenomenon. [2.22][4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-4) Your mind and body are instruments by means of which you know and act on the world, and they are therefore distinct from that self that makes use of those instruments.

> And so, as we shall see when we turn to those arguments, the Buddhist position, and indeed any no-self position, must assume the burden of explaining both the apparent integration of consciousness at each moment and our perceived identity over time in the absence of a unitary subject and agent. In order to be successful, these no-self positions must show both that the idea of the self is incoherent and that everything that the self is meant to explain can be explained in its absence. That is, the proponent of the no-self view must show that everything that the self is meant to explain can actually be accomplished by a *person,* a socially embedded human being with no self.

> Those, like Hume and the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976),[5](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-5) who argue in the Western tradition against the existence of the self, have this Christian version in mind as their target.

> I will use the word *self* only to refer to this kind of self, reserving the word *person* to denote the complex, constructed, socially embedded psychophysical complexes in which I will argue we really consist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjwkhp5n2f94gv5aqk7v48k))


> Descartes (1596–1650) famously argues in his *Meditations on First Philosophy* that we can be certain of our existence as *res cogitans,* or as *thinking things,* identical not with our bodies, or our perceptual faculties, but with our faculty of abstract reason. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjwmgwx8ykkj9rvze8q51fh))


> Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), defending a position very much like that of many of the orthodox Indian schools, argues in the *Critique of Pure Reason* that the self is a *noumenon,* a transcendental object existing outside of space and time, a pure subject or perceptual, conceptual, and aesthetic experience and agent of action, transcendentally free of the causal order.

> I suspect that the explanation of the self illusion is not cognitive, but is instead emotional, or even simply biological. There may be good evolutionary explanations of its origin, just as there are almost certainly good evolutionary explanations of how our visual system evolved to succumb to the Müller-Lyer illusion. Each of these may be, as the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould called them, spandrels, or byproducts, of traits that have real survival value, even if being duped by these illusions has no survival value in itself.

> The ninth-century Indian philosopher Śāntideva argues in *How to Lead an Awakened Life* (*Bodhicāryāvatāra*) that our conviction that we are selves arises from a primal fear of death, and that we construct the idea of a self as a bulwark against that fear.[10](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-10) Śāntideva also argues that the idea that we are selves arises primarily in emotionally charged situations, as when we perceive that we have been harmed, or when pride is aroused. It is then that we think not of our minds or bodies, but of we who possess those minds and bodies. David Hume adopts a similar view. He argues that the thought that we are selves is a product of the passions—that we posit the self as the object of pride and humility, and then reify it in thought.[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-11) If anything like these analyses is right, the idea of self is grounded not in reason or perception, but in affect.

> I will present reasons to think that we are not selves. I take this task to be important, and not simply an abstract metaphysical inquiry. This is because the self illusion *matters.* It matters in part because it obscures our own identities from us, leading to a profound misunderstanding of who and what we are, and of the degree to which our own identities and existence are bound up with those of others. And it matters because it generates a perverse moral vision that engenders an instinctive attitude of self-interest and egoism that none of us can rationally endorse, and from which we would happily free ourselves.

> Instead, the author of the dialogue suggests, while the chariot exists, it does not exist as some singular entity that is either identical to or distinct from its parts. Its mode of existence is merely *conventional,* determined by our customs regarding the application of words like *this chariot*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grm2jb1w83zv18wzget6wwc9))


> And this, Nāgasena instructs the King, is how we should think of the *person* who is called Nāgasena and his relation to that name. He is no singular entity. He is neither identical to nor distinct from his parts. He is not the possessor of those parts. There is no single part with which he is identical. His existence is merely nominal. A final account of the basic constituents of the world, even were it to contain his hair, fingers, desires, and experiences, contains no Nāgasena. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grm2kezy260g6qrb2pzjqzq2))


> What, we might ask, is the status of the person who is no self? In particular, one might wonder, what accounts for the continuity of consciousness from one moment to the next, and the persistence of our identity through all of the changes we undergo in our lives if there is no self? Wouldn’t we exist even if there were no conventions? Isn’t our existence the *precondition* of any conventions? That is, we might ask, what exactly is the mode of existence that persons like us in fact enjoy?[2](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grm2q65bq0ebp54tdx0nwwdj))


> That question involves asking why the stages of me are all stages of *me*, and the stages of you are all stages of *you*, and why we never cross over. That is, we must account both for our own identities over time and for our difference from one another. These are questions about *continuity,* or *diachronic identity—identity over time*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmdt845fdxs5xx6rz4rjdyf))


> The second issue concerns *synchronic identity,* or *identity at a single time.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmdv6ffxcmtmqgnj5t4yxcj))


> My body and my psychological states are constantly changing, like the oil and lamps that support the flames. But, like those flames and those lamps, they constitute a causal sequence with a common function. And we have a convention of calling distinct members of such sequences by the same name. So, in one obvious sense, I am not *identical* to the person called by my name yesterday. We are *alike*, causally related, but numerically distinct. In another sense, though, we are the same person. We share a name, many properties, a causal history, and a social role; and that, while not involving a self, is enough.[4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-4) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grncwpnggrk5mhtw2q0mb99x))


> We are, on this view, causally and cognitively open continua of psychophysical processes. No one of these processes by itself captures who we are; none persist unchanged over time; none are independent of the others. Together, they constitute our conventional identity, an identity we can now see to be very robust indeed. To put this another way, we do not stand over and against the world as isolated subjects; we do not act on the world as transcendent agents. Instead, we are embedded in the world as part of an interdependent reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grnd0094j9nka4nxjdz7m9e2))


> Nor does it make sense to say that the self is *different* from these sets of processes. For when we identify ourselves, or describe ourselves, we describe those very processes. How tall are you? You mention your body. How are you feeling? You mention your sensations. What kind of person are you? You mention your personality traits. If you take all of these away, though, there is nothing left: no bearer, no special entity that we recognize apart from our bodies, minds, and experiences. And when we introspect to find ourselves, all we find are our minds, bodies, and experiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grndm669hvq2xwk4m531nyhm))


> Candrakīrti argues that we are not selves, but *persons* (the Sanskrit term is *pudgala*). And the person, he argues, is neither identical to nor different from the psychophysical processes; but unlike the self, which is supposed to be an independently existent entity, there is no reason to believe that a person needs to exist in one of these ways. It is instead a socially constructed designation, posited on the bases of those processes, but not reducible to them (in a sense to be worked out in [chapter 3](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None)).[7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-7) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grndpn4w5904qr9xbtz5fgjq))


> Śāntideva endorses this analysis in *How to Lead an Awakened Life,* and he draws ethical consequences from it. He argues that the dualism of self and other underlies egocentricity. That egocentricity, in turn, leads to a strong sense of self-identity, which causes us to see ourselves as standing at the center of our own moral universes, and so as objects of special regard. He argues that this dualism derives in turn from self-grasping, from seeing the world in terms of the “I and mine” framework that derives from reifying ourselves as selves. He also argues that this is the source of the illusion that others are independent agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grne4reqxsvjp03s9nqaj60m))


> That illusion, in turn, he argues, issues in two dysfunctional emotional sets. On the one hand, the attribution of independence leads to anger when others offend or wrong us. On the other hand, the sense that we are the sole authors of our own actions leads to egoistic pride in our own accomplishments. So, he suggests, the self illusion is not only an error regarding our mode of existence, but it is an error with disastrous moral results, disenabling true friendship, care, impartiality, and joy in others’ achievements. We will return to this issue in [chapter 7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grne5n115fd1g0c290vpp60c))


> In his *Treatise of Human Nature,* David Hume argues not only that we are not selves, but also that we don’t even have an *idea* of a self—that when we talk about selves, we are literally talking nonsense.[8](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-8) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0qg1bq8bczv0ak46229ne))


> A bit later in the section just quoted he says:
>  > For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call *myself,* I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch *myself* at any time without perception, and never can observe anything but the perception. [1.4.6.3] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0tnwgnebvanpsjm17ndec))


> Moreover, he points out [1.4.6.2], the collection that we find is not constant, but is always changing. There is nothing permanent in our experience. If this is so, Hume argues, when we use the word *self,* there is nothing to which it refers: we are nothing more than bundles of psychophysical processes—changing from moment to moment—who imagine ourselves to be more than that. Note, once again, this is not the absurd claim that we don’t exist, but rather the claim that the *way* we exist—as persons—is not the way that we normally take ourselves to exist—as selves.[9](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-9) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0wm4mryrh2hjtd5ke0gvg))


> After a number of decades, we might ask, “Is this the same church that was founded decades ago, or a different one?” [1.4.6.13] The parishioners are different; the minister is different; the bodies in the churchyard are different; the building is different. Nonetheless, since it makes sense to say, “This church is fifty years old,” in the most important sense, the church remains the same. So, while it is not some entity *different* from its parishioners, minister, building, etc., nor is it *identical* to them, it exists *conventionally,* and that is enough for it to be a real, functioning church. Once again, just so for persons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0zgq932g1cc61rdy22kss))


> People instinctively regard themselves as selves in a very specific sense: they take themselves to persist through time as numerically identical subjects and agents, distinct from their minds, bodies, experiences, and traits. They do so even though they acknowledge that these minds, bodies, experiences, and traits are constantly changing and that they are only contingently connected to their selves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp12d9pjp2wxnpkh63vhm80))


> This is to say that people reflexively locate their identity not in their psychophysical characteristics, but in this hypostasized self. That is the serpent in the wall, and that is the target of Hume’s and Candrakīrti’s respective analyses. Neither of these two arguments suggests that we are nonexistent, any more than they suggest that chariots and churches are nonexistent; each instead addresses our *mode of existence*. That is, each suggests that it is irrational to claim that we exist as *selves* while affirming that we exist as *persons.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp13fgzy8nc9scgbbjp2rbx))


> We have encountered four principle conceptual ingredients to the idea of self: priority, unity, subject-object duality, and agency. That is, a self is meant to have a kind of existence *prior* to, or more fundamental than, that of body and mind; it is meant to be a unitary entity, not a multiplicity; it is that which is the subject of our cognitive objects, and so distinct from them; and it is the agent of action and the locus of responsibility.[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-11) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp1k6kfcf1ggnrzxm8qm9k8))


> This unity of the self, however, also grounds a duality: the duality of subject and object. We experience ourselves as subjects and everything else as objects, with a kind of distance between us and the world we experience. This duality so structures our naïve experience that it is hard to imagine that it is constructed, as opposed to natural. We take ourselves to be to the unseen seer, the reality known immediately in experience, the interior in which the external world is replicated and revealed in perception and in thought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp1pzj97v2a0s6qdybmwxj2))


> When we experience external objects, we naturally take ourselves to perceive them just as they are, our experience functioning as an accurate representation of just what things look, sound, smell, taste, and feel like (unless we suspect sensory distortion for some reason). That is, we either take ourselves to be in direct, unmediated contact with the world as it is, or we take that world to be faithfully reproduced inside our consciousness, in a model that Dennett has aptly called “The Cartesian Theatre.”[14](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-14) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpm75rfs3y4mvzjzyexxtzw))

> Each of these worlds is a construction, not a replication of a preexisting reality. None of these worlds has greater claim to reality than any other. So, the world we inhabit—just like the worlds of dogs, birds, and bees—is not a world we *encounter*, but a world in which we participate and which we *co-construct*.[16](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-16) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmdnmtvd95a7xyb949xacq))


> So, our awareness of the objects we encounter—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something other, dually related to ourselves—is in fact our nondual embeddedness in a world of which we are a part. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmfy80rx1frte12537tybh))


> In the same sense, our awareness of our subjective states—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something immediately present, dually related to that which is other—is in fact just another aspect of our nondual embeddedness in that world. We participate in the construction of what we regard as external to us, and what is external to us participates in the construction of what we experience as the inner. In sum, the very dichotomy of self and other, inner and outer, is a construction, not a given. Much of our life is structured by the illusion that we just find what we in fact construct; but the fact that this illusion structures so much of our experience does not mean that it is not an illusion.

> Uncaused action, or random intentions are not only impossible, but also undesirable. Nonetheless, among the illusions for which we seem to be wired is the Augustinian illusion that our decisions to act are uncaused. This is part of the self illusion, for it reflects the assumption that we somehow, at least in part of our being, stand not within but outside of the world, and so are exempt from causal determinism. We will turn to the ethical dimensions of this illusion in [chapter 7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmn65cxcdf9v65b9m56g1w))


> At the most basic level, the illusion of a self is the illusion that we stand outside of and against the world. We take ourselves pre-reflectively to be singularities: not participants in the world, but spectators of the world, and agents of actions directed on that world. This is what Wittgenstein’s metaphor of the relation of the eye to the visual field captures: the feeling that we as selves are not something in the world, but instead that we are the supramundane necessary conditions of its appearance to us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmr952zdm1e8en1yxtjqks))


> To my mind, that natural attitude of taking ourselves to be selves is a symptom of a profound instinct for self-alienation, and is the deepest form of what Buddhist philosophers call *primal confusion,* the root of suffering. We are, that is, wired to misunderstand our own mode of existence.[19](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-19) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmwy1bm9tw7s5faybqrrv0))


> Neuroscience does not reveal a central ego in the brain that marks who we *are,* as opposed to what we experience or do. There is no single place in the brain where it all “comes together,” or where consciousness is seated. Instead, neuroscientists focus on the patterns of activity that enable us to bind our experience into an experienced unity, patterns that allow us to self-identify, and that locate us in a spatiotemporal manifold along with our objects of experience. These processes are widely distributed in the brain, drawing on networks associated with perception, motor control, affect, conation, … ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmyc8gc0wvvnwsrc9dcsad))


> While the upshot of these processes, as Metzinger puts it, is an illusion, or a model, of a self,[20](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-20) they hardly *constitute* a self any more than *Moby-Dick* brings Captain Ahab into real existence. To think that they do is to confuse the serpent in the wall with the nonexistent elephant in the room. This is because the patterns that the most plausible current neuroscientific models identify involve the large-scale coordination of neural activity connecting widely disparate parts of the brain. These include areas associated with proprioception, interoception, perception, language, motor control, long-term and semantic memory, working memory, and so forth.

> All of this is to say that we are many, not one; we are collections of collections of processes, not unities; we are more like hives than bees in that respect.

> The relationship between a fiction and the characters it creates is thus double-edged, reflecting the curious and often overlooked fact that the words *fact* and *fiction* are cognate, sharing the Latin root *fingere—*to *make*, or to *fashion*. Fictions create facts. And this means *both* that the contents of fiction are *creations,* not mind-independent realities, *and* that nonetheless there is truth and falsity with respect to them, truth and falsity constituted by the very act of their creation.

> The point of this analogy is thus that to be a person is to be something like Hamlet, not to be like the actor playing Hamlet. Hamlet requires an actor to be instantiated—to be brought to life on the stage—as well as a literary context and a set of theatrical conventions that enable that instantiation or enlivening. In the same sense, we require bodies and collections of psychophysical processes to bring us to life on the stages in which we fret and strut our particular hours (to mix Shakespearean plays) as well as a social context and set of conventions that enable us to be recognized not merely as live human bodies, but as persons among persons. To the extent that we are single characters over our lifetime, we are, like Hamlet, played by a succession of actors: an infant; a toddler; a schoolchild; finally, with any luck, an elder.

> There is at least one important difference between Hamlet and one of us: our lines are not written in advance, and our characters are performed in the context of an improv show, not a scripted play. This is important because independence is at the core of the idea of the self, and as we discard *that* idea, one further myth worth discarding is the myth that we ever stand on our own two feet. Instead, our identity is forged only partly by the actors who perform the roles in which our identities consist: we are not performed by solo actors in a stand-up club, but in a vast improv group including friends, family, colleagues, and fellow citizens. Who we are reflects the way our role fits into this indefinitely large, unbounded human drama. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpr2tvcd9ean7v93ypvs2s6))


> That is the sense in which we have a *personal* identity, and it is a very real sense, a fact brought into life through our collective narrative and enactive agency: the *personae* that populate our drama are created, not discovered. Our identity endures through change, however, not because we are entities separate from the institutions, relations, narratives, and embodiment that bring us into existence. On the contrary, it endures precisely because of those very institutions, relations, narratives, and in virtue of that very embodiment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grprahcyq26dcawb65e314g0))


> And the self that we instinctively grasp and that plays this deep psychological role is *not* the person we have just characterized. The self is taken to be preexistent, primordial, unitary, and transcendent of the world of objects, independent of body, mind, and social context. The person is constructed; the person is dependent on the psychophysical and social network in which it is realized; the person is complex, embodied and embedded. That is the difference between the actor and the role. We are roles, not actors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grprgfspkxcqqjjspqbghes9))


> Here are three of the most important, seductive, and pernicious of those myths:

> Interdependence can thus be a source of misery as well as of joy; of despair as well as of gratitude. This does not, however, mean that we can escape it. Interdependence is a fact of life; and our identity as persons is a consequence of that interdependence, for good and for ill.

> It makes a great deal of biological, psychological, and ecological sense instead to think of awareness as a constant modulation of the open interaction between an organism and its environment, of the adjustment of the state of the organism and attunement of the posture and goals of the organism as its senses and movements interact with the world it inhabits. In other words, we can think of awareness as a mode of embedding of the organism in its world, instead of as the relation between an interior subject and an exterior object, even if that is how it appears to us in introspection. To think of awareness in this way is to take seriously the idea that we don’t stand against the world as subjects that detect its properties or agents that act on it, but instead are part of the world, and that awareness is more an attunement to our environment than a recording in our minds of what is going on outside. This approach to cognition, which is called the “embedded, embodied, enactive” model of cognition, is gaining wide acceptance among philosophers and cognitive scientists.[6](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter5-6) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs7bwqh802vtm5c3zmfkd798))

> This does not mean that memory is just imagination. There is a difference, but this difference concerns only the distinct causal ancestries of a present cognitive state. Perceptual experience is more salient as a cause of memory than of imagination. But this is a difference of degree, not of kind; to be a memory is only to be the effect of a particular kind of causal chain originating in an experience. The intermediate steps in that chain include a host of brain and cognitive processes of which we are largely unaware, and which are each responsible for any memory we construct, even though that construction may feel like the retrieval of an intact perceptual snapshot.

> But we must be careful not to confuse the personhood constituted by these narratives with the kind of basic identity or pure subjectivity assigned to selves. It is one thing to say that our personhood is constituted by narrative, and another to say that our very subjectivity is. To be sure, persons are in part constituted through narratives, and through participation in the norm-governed practices that make narrative possible. Nonetheless, no proponent of the reality of the self—as distinct from the person—could take narrative as the basis of that reality. For the self is meant to be that which makes subjectivity possible in the first place, and we must already have subjectivity in place in order to be able to tell stories about ourselves.[31](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter5-31) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsnjc6t3ertbmthe1k47vxcb))

> The important point here is that when we talk about our immediate sense of self, our atavistic sense of who we are, we do *not* take ourselves to be constructed, or conventional, or to be “made out of different modes of self-awareness.” That is the elephant.

And that self-grasping can’t be rendered innocuous by changing our terminology and focusing on personal identity instead of the reality of the self.

> In order to get our minds around the experience of selflessness, it is useful to recall the deep connection between the sense of self, the understanding of experience in terms of subject-object duality, and of action in terms of free agency. To take ourselves to be selves, as we saw in [chapter 1](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None), is to take ourselves to be subjects with a very different mode of existence than that we assign to our objects. It is to regard ourselves as standing *against* the world rather than as being embedded *in* it. And it is to take our self-knowledge to be immediate, as opposed to the mediated knowledge we have of our objects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspvc4zpp9qatgjbmj048g6s))


> We can make the same point about agency. To see ourselves as selves is to see ourselves as free agents acting upon the world, capable of agent causation that initiates actions on motives, actions whose causes lie entirely within us. This is how we often make sense of the difference between *action* and *mere behavior*, and this is how we often make sense of moral and legal responsibility. This is how subject-object duality looks in the domain of action. In perceptual experience the subject is divorced from the world and located as a spectator of it. By analogy, in action the agent is divorced from the causal nexus and acts freely upon it. Once again, then, to the extent that we experience ourselves as fully immersed, and not as freely initiating actions directed upon objects, our agency is nondual in character: we act without superimposing the self or the duality between self and other implicated by the sense of causally independent agency.

> When performing as a virtuoso, one is in what psychologists call a “flow” state.[2](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter6-2) In such a state, one experiences one’s action as spontaneous, not as planned or calculated; one’s own body, cognitive states, and the objects around one are not objects of reflective awareness, even though in these moments one is perhaps more closely perceptually attuned to the world and to one’s own actions than at any other time. There is, despite this exquisite attunement and control, no experience of subject-object duality, and no awareness of self. The achievement of real expertise, the *Zhuangzi* suggests through this parable, is in part the achievement of this kind of perceptual skill and perceptual-motor attunement. In the achievement of virtuosity, if this is right, we also see the *elimination* of one’s sense of self. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspvma8ehsb81dhmv6pnf69b))


> There is another nice insight we can glean from this story. While Ding and Wenhui might appear to be the only important characters, there is one more: the knife that, although it hasn’t been sharpened in nineteen years, is still so sharp that it finds the spaces in the joints and moves through them effortlessly. Zhuangzi is reminding us here that the boundaries of our embodiment are not necessarily those of our human bodies. The tools and equipment we use become part of us as persons. We experience this all the time. When we use a stick to probe a hole, we feel the hole through the stick; when we drive a car, we experience the car as an extension of our body and feel ourselves to be in control of its movements; when we look into the rear-view mirror, we see not a reflection, but what is behind us, and so on. This reminds us of another aspect of the nonduality of our experience. We do not exist outside of our environment, perceiving it as subject, acting on it as agent; we are nondually immersed in it, with no clear boundary between ourselves and everything else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspvnm39d9aw5k0qwepch1m3))

> We hence see that it is not the presence of explicit thought that distinguishes ego-involved experience from ego-less experience. Instead, this distinction reflects the degree of immersion in activity and so the degree to which explicit awareness of oneself as standing outside that activity is diminished. It is a distinction that is more phenomenological than psychological, having to do with how we experience our own engagement with the world. When we are completely immersed in activity—whether the physical activity of carving an ox or the cognitive activity of thinking about how best to carve that ox—our sense of self, and with it, the experience of the duality of subject and object in experience, vanish. There is only the experience of a flow of activity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspvv59xzepk9w8612egsw32))


> And this is a good thing for at least two reasons. First, immersed phenomenology is less likely to lead us into the error of positing the self. This is because the subject-object duality that thematizes the self as the subject of experience or the agent of action is itself a misleading structural superimposition on experience, a superimposition absent in immersed experience. Second, immersed phenomenology is indicative of expertise, and facilitates more fluid, successful performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspvvgm73vp1r8e5dnvaf5rs))


> This reflective, self-conscious perspective enables us to plan, to train, to monitor our own experience and actions so as to improve them. Skilled coaches direct us to monitor ourselves carefully while practicing a skill for this very reason. But they encourage this kind of explicit attention with the goal that we cast off that monitoring and awareness as we become more skilled. The point is that this kind of subjectivity has its point primarily in such circumstances, and it is useful primarily because of its power to facilitate immersed experience through the development of expertise. Self-monitoring is a *special,* not a *general* feature of our cognition, presupposing a background of fluid engagement with the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspx5n3ejbfjy2y0fyd1hanb))


> We are rarely aware of that omnipresent background of fluid engagement, a background necessary even for calculative, deliberate thought. After all, to make it an object of awareness would be to kill it. But if our awareness did not implicate this background—if it was always reflective and self-conscious—we could never function. We would always be caught up in a self-conscious obsession with our own present experiences, intentions, and actions, and like the proverbial centipede who was asked to explain how he coordinates all of those legs, we could no longer walk. But once we draw our attention to this background dimension of our psychology, we see that it is ubiquitous. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gspx6mw01bfq40qedqd9wvmj))

> expert consciousness is nondual. The expert is not conscious of his or her own subjectivity and its relation to the object with which he or she is engaged, or even of the tools the expert might be using, including his or her own body. That is the kind of novice awareness that just gets in the way. Instead, the focused attention of the expert is entirely on the task at hand and on the goals to be accomplished through that task. It is immersed, embodied awareness, and awareness that is entirely fluid, adjusting to the ever-changing demands of the task at hand. Nothing resembling a self is ever present in this kind of consciousness. This is the sense in which actors or dancers, when they are successful, completely *inhabit* their roles, becoming the roles they embody, instead of experiencing *themselves* as performing those roles.[8](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter6-8) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gstya5587m848jfvj9mqh1ck))

This is because it re-reinscribes the subject-object distinction that originates as an account of our *cognitive* relation to the world, but this time as an account of our *ethical* relation to the world.

That is to see oneself as a character in a play with no special protagonists, a play performed and written on the fly by a vast improv collective.

The near enemy in this case is partiality, or jingoism. This is the attitude in which we rejoice in the success of those with whom we associate, or those who we take to be our friends, or to be “on our side,” while being indifferent to or even dismayed by the success of those we perceive as more distant from us in the moral landscape. Once again, that is an attitude that takes our own location to be special, and that assigns degrees of moral concern to others in terms of their proximity to us. That assignment of a special role to ourselves at the moral origin is part of the self illusion, and sympathetic joy is inconsistent with that orientation.

To see things from the egocentric perspective reflecting the view of a self is to remove oneself from *membership* in the world and to adopt the position of an *experiencer* of the world and an *agent* acting on it.

So, if I become annoyed because you push me from behind, you might mollify me by pointing out that you did not voluntarily push me, but were yourself pushed into me by the person behind you.

But since they weren’t, the fault lies not with God but with Adam and Eve. So, out of a theological problem, a moral, legal, and metaphysical ideology was born.

In brief, to say that one level of description (the supervening level) supervenes on another (the base level) is just to say that any two worlds where everything is the same at the base level are also identical at the supervening level.

> But the supervenience of chess on the physical is consistent with the fact that that same chess game could have been played online, with nothing moving around on a physical board. Chess moves are therefore neither identical with nor reducible to the movements of wooden pieces on a board, even though they may be instantiated by those movements. Nor could we replace a theory of chess with a theory of wooden objects and their movements. The money in my wallet, as we have seen, is neither identical with nor reducible to the banknotes, even though they instantiate it. There are plenty of other ways to have that much money.

> One way to put this is to say that we are biologically determined to create social structures that provide the context in which we develop psychologically. Our psychology in turn helps to elaborate these social structures, which in turn shape our psychology. This complex psychological and social environment in turn helps to determine our biological heritage as well as its expression in concrete situations. Persons emerge from this looping, spiraling interaction between variables at each of these levels of description. None can be ignored if we want to understand who we are. Let us now turn to some of the specific ways that we emerge as persons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtr7khmm6p4pbr2e45exzgs8))


> We are born helpless, in need of care, and we are biologically endowed with the resources to seek, to stimulate, and to accept that care. This is a commonplace. But the impact on how we emerge as persons is profound. It means that we come to understand ourselves as persons, and to manifest that personhood not through an immediate first-person awareness of ourselves, as one might expect were we selves, but rather through our awareness of and our recognition by second persons. The contemporary British developmental psychologist Vasudevi Reddy has explored this aspect of our cognitive and affective development in great depth.[9](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-9) Her empirical work and her reflection on that work provide compelling evidence regarding how early human infants recognize second persons, and how central that recognition is not only to their later recognition of third persons, but, more importantly, to their own self-conception as first persons.[10](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-10) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtr7tvms9j226243n4gvjxcn))


> Reddy asks, “what does it take to be aware that someone is attending to you?”[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-11) This apparently simple question raises two others that are essential to understanding how we come to be persons: First, what does it take to recognize another’s attention? Second, what does it take to recognize oneself as the object of that attention? Reddy begins to answer these questions when she says, “the awareness of self as the object of others’ attention … must lead to, rather than result from, representations of self and other as psychological entities. This perspective assumes what one might call a ‘second-person’ approach to the developing awareness of self and other.”[12](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-12) That is, our awareness of ourselves as subjects dawns with our awareness of those who address us and who we address. In other words, the first-person and the second-person are co-emergent. We cannot understand our own self-consciousness without understanding its emergence through our consciousness of others.

> Reddy also argues that early dyadic infant-parent interactions involve the spontaneous perception of action as intentional, and that these interactions are often dialogical, and so involve the explicit representation of subjective *difference* between the participants.[13](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-13) Infants and caregivers, that is to say, are explicitly exchanging information in these interactions; each is cognizant both of what she has to communicate and of the knowledge and ignorance of the other. This is important because it shows that even before they master language, infants represent the difference in perspective between themselves and those with whom they interact, and the distinct roles each takes in dyadic interactions. The implications of this awareness of difference for the development of personhood are profound. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtr87rkd0qgn5vm7589gdxqt))

> This recognition of the difference between oneself and another is very important. It is part of the foundation of our development as persons and our recognition of ourselves and of others as occupants of roles. For these interactions are not only *dyadic*; they are *dialogical*, with each participant taking a different role. The infant recognizes the difference in perspective, in intention, and in capacity of the second person. Subjectivity is hence understood, from the beginning of human life, not as uniform, but as varying from person to person; the infant’s own subjective states, intentions, and experiences are not simply projected onto the dialogical partner; they are *differentiated* from them. That is, early in life, infants come to understand that minds constitute a multiplicity, with many different instances.[15](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-15) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtr8bsy2kk8q8xeaeveze4w3))

> The typical development of social cognition … originates in … second-person engagements that irresistibly involve the infant, changing not only the infant cognizer’s capacity to cognize, but also that which develops to be cognized. The emotional involvement of persons, in particular those most salient of emotional involvements that occur in second-person engagements where the infant is directly addressed or responded to by another, becomes the crucible of cognition.[16](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-16) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtr93dehjhp1cwasv3nq2e08))


> She continues:
>  > Both types of experiences, second-person involvements and third-person observations, must influence each other and both may be necessary even for stable pre-inferential perceptions of other minds.… But being addressed as a You and addressing the other as a You arouses emotional responses differently from watching someone else being addressed, and engenders—even if briefly—a mutuality and suspension of separateness. The other becomes a person to you, someone who knocks you off balance or enters your consciousness in a more fundamental way than when you are largely untouched by the other, or just watching them.[17](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter8-17) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtr952qdxpgpc2gb2j96hddj))

> Once again, this biological and psychological feature leads us to structure our social lives and our cultures around networks of customs. Those cultures then create niches in which the ability to detect and the tendency to respect custom are selected. All of this generates a virtuous spiral, a spiral that produces our highly regulated lives and social orders. This regulation, paradoxically, is what makes it possible for us to be the creative individuals we are, for creativity requires meaning, mutual recognition, and forms of life in which it makes sense to be creative.

> To say that we are creatures of custom is thus not simply to note our propensity for regularity or mutual imitation; it is to identify one of the deepest aspects of our nature, one that allows us to be social and hence that enables us to develop the qualities we cultivate in early parent-child interactions into those that constitute us as adult persons. That is the propensity not only to *imitate*, but to take behavioral convergence to be *normative*.[3](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter9-3) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtra1k2t7pnn1x90q4vmyptk))

If we take this aspect of personhood as seriously as I have been arguing that we must, it follows that our very being, like the institutions in the context of which we function, is socially constructed: we are essentially social animals, or, as Bernard Mandeville (1670–1733) would have it, complicated bees.

> We are hence constructed as persons both by our intentional, conscious participation in social structures and by our tacit participation in them; that construction includes both attitudes and roles of which we are explicitly aware and those that may be merely implicit. To be shaped by and to shape this spiral requires us to be in constant open causal interaction with our physical and social environment; it requires that our behavior and thought are conditioned by that environment. This is the flexibility and the embeddedness of persons, not the isolation and constancy of selves. Indeed, there is no place for the self—for the serpent in the wall—in this story. At best it would be a fifth wheel; in fact, as I have argued, it is an incoherent posit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtreyw88m16rpcr2eab9kcwp))


> And we use those stories to make sense of our behavior and attitudes in specific circumstances and to make sense of the biographical arcs of our lives. We explain our decision to take a bus rather than to drive a car by talking about how our commitment to the environment structures our life, or our decision to vote for this candidate rather than that one by how her candidacy enhances the life we lead. In eulogies we strive to present the life of the departed as a coherent whole. Narrative is perhaps the most important vehicle for achieving self-understanding. Philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), as well as the contemporary scholars Daniel Hutto and Evan Thompson, get this exactly right.[7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter9-7) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtrezqhr2d5chzbayq1p1423))


> But there is a dark side to narrative as well. For one thing, as we saw in [chapter 3](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None), we are not the sole authors of the stories in which we participate, and some of these tales may be deeply destructive. For another, it is all too easy to take the characters in the narratives we coauthor to exist independently of the stories. And just as we shouldn’t ever think that Hamlet has any reality outside of the play, we shouldn’t ever think that we as persons have any reality outside of the narratives in which we participate. In one sense, we are as fictional as Shakespeare’s creations: we are constituted as characters through the telling of a story; we are absolutely real within the bounds of that story; we are created, not discovered; and we have no reality at all outside of the context of the stories in which we figure. This is why we are *persons*, and not *selves*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtrf0jkttcfhkgekc7ar3kba))


> But we are *real* persons, and not *imaginary* persons. Therefore, in another sense, we are different from Hamlet and his cohort, and that difference is every bit as important as the similarity. Shakespeare’s fiction is local, optional, and its roles need not be instantiated; the fiction in which we play our parts is global and mandatory. And the roles we play are necessarily instantiated by biologically real creatures. We, unlike literary persons, are *embodied, embedded,* and *enactive* in our world. All three of these differences are important. Let us take them in turn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtrf1nr0nv96k2tsxdzq3skf))


> Those of us who figure in our own grand social narrative, however, are connected globally to one another and to history. Our lives have broad and direct effects on countless others. We leave traces that span reality, and that are not confined between the covers of a book or to the minds of those who read it. This globality of the narrative in which we figure is one important difference between imaginary and real fictional characters: while it doesn’t undermine our fictional status, it is one aspect of our lives that confers on us the reality that facts enjoy. That is what it is for us to *enact* our personhood. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtrf432ed65j362z0f55gvcw))

Even to turn away when our attention is demanded, even to shirk our moral or social responsibilities, is to participate—however unwillingly—in these dramas. To act in bad faith is still to act. All of this is to say that the narratives that constitute us as persons also constitute our world, and so are *mandatory* fictions. This mandatoriness is another aspect of our human life that confers facthood on it, that constitutes its *truth,* however fictional that truth might be.

> To treat our understanding of ourselves and others in terms of interpretation is not to deny that there is any truth of the matter regarding what we think and how we feel, to assert that anything goes. This is because interpretation does not reflect, so much as *constitute*, the reality of our cognitive lives. Any interpretation, whether of *Hamlet* or of my mind, stands or falls on the grounds of its harmony with all of our other interpretations. And that harmony is sufficient to constitute truth; its absence is sufficient for falsehood. That is, while the entire ensemble of social and interpretative conventions in which we participate may *constitute the context* in which it is true that I believe that Ulan Bator is the capital of Mongolia, once that context is in place, there is a clear fact of the matter regarding whether or not I hold this belief.

> To allow ourselves to be addressed by, or to address, another is to take her to be a person, to have a mind; it is at the same time to take ourselves to be persons. This phenomenon of address requires neither reflexive self-consciousness, nor qualitative experience, nor interiority, nor autonomy, nor any of the other properties associated with selves. It only requires us to recognize each other as members of the same community, sharing the same world. But what is it to recognize ourselves and others to be members of a community of persons? It is, we shall see, to see one another as *valuable,* as objects of care and respect. And the deepest reason to forego the myth of the self for the recognition of the reality of the person is that it is persons, not selves, that merit respect and care.

In short, this kind of moral and political recognition is the recognition of *persons*, not of *selves.* And this is why it makes sense to think of organizations or natural phenomena as persons, as grounds for treating them with respect, or as grounds for the conferral of rights, even though it would make no sense whatsoever to assert that they have *selves,* even if we thought that we do.
