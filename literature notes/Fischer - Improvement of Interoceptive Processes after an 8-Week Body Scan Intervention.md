# Fischer - Improvement of Interoceptive Processes after an 8-Week Body Scan Intervention

_previous note:_ [[interoception as fundamental feature of embodiment]]

> the main objective of this research is to examine the effects of a BS intervention on different interoceptive subdomains over 8 weeks of training in two different samples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7cxah9p6kymsv470skvqfry))


> **Methods:** In study 1, healthy participants executed a 20 min standardized audiotaped BS in the BS intervention group (*n* = 25) each day over 8 weeks. The control group (*n* = 24) listened to an audio book for the same amount of time. In study 2, the BS group (*n* = 18) was compared to an inactive control group (*n* = 18). In both studies, three measurement points were realized and interoceptive accuracy (IAc) – using a heartbeat perception task – as well as interoceptive sensibility (IS) – using confidence ratings for the heartbeat perception task and the subscale ‘interoceptive awareness’ of the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2) – were assessed.

- Note: these 'confidence ratings' for interoceptive sensibility seem dodgy as hell. I mean, why would my perception of myself change after such a short period of time? Seems like self-reporting is so so tricky (no surprises there).

> However, the increasing interest in interoception is due to its close link to emotions, feelings, and the perception of disease-specific symptoms ([Schandry et al., 1993](#ref-71); [Tsakiris et al., 2011](#ref-74)). Individuals with a more precise detection of internal bodily signals experience emotions more intensively, are better able to process such signals, respectively, and to regulate them (e.g., [Craig, 2003](#ref-11); [Barrett et al., 2004](#ref-4); [Critchley et al., 2004](#ref-12); [Herbert et al., 2011](#ref-33)).

> [Garfinkel and Critchley (2013)](#ref-28) and [Garfinkel et al. (2015)](#ref-30) proposed a clear demarcation between the different nomenclatures and meanings of the term interoception. Recently, they developed a three-dimensional model of interoception and provided empirical support for the necessity to assess different aspects of interoceptive processes ([Garfinkel et al., 2015](#ref-30)). The model differentiates between interoceptive accuracy (IAc), interoceptive sensibility (IS), and interoceptive awareness.

> Another possibility to assess IS is to indicate one’s own subjective confidence in the performance of a specific IAc task (e.g., [Ehlers et al., 1995](#ref-22); [Khalsa et al., 2008](#ref-46); [Parkin et al., 2014](#ref-59)).

> Whereas different self-focus procedures showed first evidence for improved interoceptive processes, previous research investigating techniques stemming from a Buddhism mindfulness tradition are rare and the evidence is mixed. Because mindfulness interventions are concerned with the idea of being present in the moment, focusing on the body and related signals in a non-judgmental way, such methods are of high interest in research on interoception.

> However, there is a growing body of research showing positive effects of practicing the BS continuously on body perception, concentration, awareness of different disease-specific symptoms, and stress reduction ([Ditto et al., 2006](#ref-16); [Weiss et al., 2010](#ref-78); [Dreeben et al., 2013](#ref-17)). It is presented here that there are no studies available exploring the single effect of the BS over 8 weeks on interoceptive processes which is especially important for the research.

> In addition, it has been demonstrated recently that a mindfulness training can improve IS [subscales attention regulation, self-regulation, body listening and trusting of the multidimensional assessment of interoceptive awareness (MAIA); [Mehling et al., 2012](#ref-55)] in depressed patients compared to both an active-control group and a healthy control group ([Fissler et al., 2016](#ref-27)).

> Similar results were found in studies of [Nielsen and Kaszniak (2006)](#ref-58) as well as [Melloni et al. (2013)](#ref-56). In both studies, the level of experience in meditation was not associated with differences in IAc. However, meditation experts felt significantly more confident in their interoceptive performance and experienced the task as easier compared to non-experts.

> There is only one study investigating the influence of an 8-week MBSR- or MBCT on IAc and IS ([Parkin et al., 2014](#ref-59)). Results showed no improvement in heartbeat perception, but participants felt more confident in their performance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7cy5553pg4dd51q9kcgajkt))


> Furthermore, [Parkin et al. (2014)](#ref-59) discussed the differences between IAc and IS. They attributed, that IS will strengthen cognitive processes for the body perception due to the training, especially evaluations, memories as well as attitudes, which is independent from the real perception. This assumption is in line with the differentiation between IAc and IS by [Garfinkel et al. (2015)](#ref-30) and should be considered.

> the interoceptive dimensions suggested by [Garfinkel et al. (2015)](#ref-30) were assessed as the main dependent variables: IAc (heartbeat tracking task) and IS [confidence and the subscale “Interoceptive awareness” of the German Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2); [Paul and Thiel, 2005](#ref-60)].
