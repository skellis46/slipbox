# Sacasas - Lonely Surfaces:  On AI-generated Images

_previous note:_ [[Postman's technopoly]]

> They fail to understand, as Neil Postman once put it, that technological change is ecological rather than additive. Powerful new tools can restructure the complex techno-social ecosystem we call art in sometimes striking and often unpredictable ways. Even if we don’t think a new tool “kills” art, we should be curious about how it might transform art, or at least some of the skills and practice we have called art.

> Along these lines, I appreciated the reflections of another digital artist, Annie Dorsen.²

>> “When tinkerers and hobbyists, doodlers and scribblers—not to mention kids just starting to perceive and explore the world—have this kind of instant gratification at their disposal,” Dorsen argues, “their curiosity is hijacked and extracted.” “For all the surrealism of these tools’ outputs,” she adds, “there’s a banal uniformity to the results.” She went on to write that “when people’s imaginative energy is replaced by the drop-down menu ‘creativity’ of big tech platforms, on a mass scale, we are facing a particularly dire form of immiseration.”

> The most important thing about a technology is not necessarily what can be done with it in singular instances, it is rather what habits its use instills in us and how these habits shape us over time. I recently wrote about how the skimming sort of reading that characterizes so much of our engagement with digital texts (and which often gets transferred to our engagement with analog texts) arises as a coping mechanism for the overwhelming volume of text we typically encounter on any given day. So, likewise, might we settle for a scanning sort of looking, one that is content to bounce from point to point searching but never delving thus never quite seeing.

> For what it’s worth, one of the better descriptions I’ve encountered of how these applications work was provided by Marco Donnarumma, who is himself a digital artist and a machine learning researcher. “Figuratively speaking,” Donnarumma explained, “AI image generators create a cartography of a dataset, where features of images and texts (in the form of mathematical abstractions) are distributed at particular locations according to probability calculations.” “The cartography,” he goes on to say, “is called a ‘manifold’ and it contains all the image combinations that are possible with the data at hand. When a user prompts a generator, this navigates the manifold in order to find the location where the relevant sampling features lie."
