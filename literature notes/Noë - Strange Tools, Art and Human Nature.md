# Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature

_previous note:_ [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]]


_Strange Tools_ is a book by the philosopher Alva Noë about the importance of art in our lives. Noë writes that the basic argument of the book is as follows:

>Our lives are structured by organization. Art is a practice for bringing our organization into view; in doing this, art reorganizes us.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 4. Art Loops and the Garden of Eden, n.p.]


--- 


## 2 Reorganizing Ourselves

>The result isn’t positive knowledge, or settled agreement, as such. Rather, the result is something like understanding, where this means, roughly, knowing your way around.

>You might object: surely this can’t be right! Choreography is hot and sweaty; it is bodily and musical. It is emotional. Choreography is not cool and intellectual the way philosophy is. Even if choreography has intellectual concerns, surely there’s all the difference in the world between the work and concerns of dance and those of philosophy!
But here lurks a double misunderstanding. First, as we will have occasion to discuss further in chapter 11, philosophy is not so cool as you may be tempted to think, even if it is intellectual. It begins in puzzlement. It works with argument and aims at persuasion. Philosophy runs hot. And choreography, for its part, can be very cool.
Second, my claim is not that choreography and philosophy are qualitatively the same, or that it is the impulse to philosophize that moves the choreographer, or an impulse to dance that moves the philosopher. No, philosophy and choreography are as different from each other as painting is from music, or writing poetry from making sculpture. And yet they all do basically the same job: they expose the concealed ways we are organized by the things we do.



##  4. Art Loops and the Garden of Eden

>Art is interested in removing tools (in my extended sense) from their settings and thus in making them strange and, in making them strange, bringing out the ways and textures of the embedding that had been taken for granted. A work of art is a strange tool, an alien implement. We make strange tools to investigate ourselves.

>But there is a second source of complexity: reorganizational practices loop back and change first-order activities.
Take the case of dancing. We dance; it is our nature to do so. Choreography puts this fact about us on display, for us to witness and understand. But the existence of choreographies—their image, their power to coalesce and stand forth as models of how the activity could or should be done—loops back down and shapes how we think about dancing, and thus how we dance, even when we are by ourselves or in our most intimate settings. In a world in which dance has been represented, it is not generally possible to dance in a way that is insulated from dance’s image, that is, from choreography’s model of ourselves as dancing. Watch people dance, and you see them perform; they cite and sample the postures, attitudes, steps, and styles that they have consumed. It is as if their spontaneous, free, untutored forays into dancing are shaped by a culturally shared motion bank.

>So now let’s ask: What is the point of scoring? What are we doing? What is this all about? One answer—it’s a way of recording what happened—is right, but superficial. A better answer is that keeping score is a way of thinking about and organizing our understanding of the play. It is a meaning-making activity. It is a kind of research. We write the game down to think about the game.
With that said, we come to a telling further point.
Keeping score is not, in fact, an activity external to the game. Very literally, how a game is scored defines what is going on in the game and so it matters to the players.
Crucially, whether you take the trouble actually to keep score, playing baseball requires that you have a scorekeeper’s mentality, that you think of what is going on around you in the same terms as the scorekeeper would. How we score the game affects how a player feels or thinks about what he is doing, what situation he finds himself in, and so on.
Players live in the scorekeeper’s reality.


# 5. Art, Evolution, and the Puzzle of Puzzles

In Hollander’s words, “Far from seeing objectively, the mirror gazer is engaged in creating a posed studio portrait of himself, not even a candid shot.” Mirror images, we might say, are transient or throwaway selfies.

We don’t make pictures to lay down memories; we make pictures, in this epoch of pictorial consciousness, so that we can even have experiences. It is as if, were we to fail to make an image, or, indeed, to concern ourselves with images, nothing would ever really happen. And so lovers hold each other tight on the bench by the sea, but she holds her camera phone out and takes the selfie that authenticates the event as significant.
It’s worrying. If every moment is a Kodak moment, then, really, no moment is. I suspect that the compulsion to take pictures of ourselves—not unlike the compulsion to look at ourselves in the shop windows as we walk by—reflects not merely a passing fad or impulse, but a kind of culmination of the way pictures have made us, as it were, in their own image.

## 7. Philosophical Objects

>Now the character of the movie’s skepticism shifts to one of philosophy’s enduring concerns: the very possibility of knowing other people and what they think and feel. Philosophers have long noticed that there is room for doubt in this domain: all we ever really know, when it comes to others, is what they say and do. We can’t get inside their heads to learn directly what they actually think and feel. We are always at a remove from the other. It is also clear, to philosophy, and to us all, that this intellectual worry can be safely set aside in the course of our ordinary lives. Questions about what those around us are thinking and feeling and doing, let alone questions about whether they have inner lives at all, don’t seriously arise. Which itself raises a philosophical question: If the basis of our knowledge is so slight, why is our confidence in other minds so robust? ^c8e1b6

## 8. See Me if You Can!

>These days, as a matter of fact, there is a strong tendency to at least try to explain art away—along with humor and everything else. It is widely supposed that questions like those posed above—What is art? Why do we value it? What does it tell us about ourselves?—can and should be answered in the key of neuroscience. We think that everything about us that matters is fixed by our brains and that by turning our focus inward we can discover our true nature. And so it seems right, when we face the task of making sense of art, to look to neuroscience.
I take a different approach. Not because there’s anything wrong with trying to understand art in relation to our biology; indeed, this is an exciting and important aspiration. But rather because neuroscience has yet to frame an adequate conception of our biology. We can’t take neuroscience for granted as an intellectual readymade.

>One reason is that it is a mistake to think that our responses to works of art are ever only mere responses. They are more like judgments, and, like judgments in general, they are thoughtful. Also, they are shaped by our knowledge and background and experience and the larger culture and shared attitudes and the ongoing dialogue among artists and experts and the rest of us. The idea that there is an aesthetic response whose neurological underpinnings could be usefully exhumed strikes me as something that could be seriously advanced only by people who are quite removed from art and the ways it matters.
A work of art is not merely a trigger for a feeling or a perceptual response or anything else. In that sense, it is not merely a thing. It is a work. Art is a topic.
Actually, it is a mistake to think of seeing (or perception) in general according to the trigger-experience conception. As if things just cause the lighting up of experiences inside our heads. This may be a traditional way to think and talk; it’s the British way. But it’s a straitjacket. The world acts on us and changes our brains. But we act right back on the world, and so we change what there is changing us. We do so just by moving, not to mention by making, doing, taking hold. John Dewey offers an alternative to the trigger theory: perception is an activity of doing and undergoing, a transaction with the world around us. Or, as the psychologist James J. Gibson claims, seeing doesn’t happen in the eye-brain system, it happens in the eye-brain-head-body-ground-environment system. It is something we do, not something that happens inside us. And like everything we do, it depends on more than just what is going on at a time inside the skull.

## 9. Why Is Art So Boring?

>Works of art are strange tools, after all. That is, they are tools we can’t use, they are useless. They are texts with no practical content, or pictures that don’t show us anything in particular. And so they require us to stop doing. To stop acting and to stop demanding application or even pertinence. Again the comparison with philosophy is apt. Philosophy doesn’t yield positive nuggets of information that you can take away and put to work in this or that area of your life, the way physics, mathematics, or economics does. Art, like philosophy, is not practical in this sense. The pictures in the clothing catalog show you something you can buy; the architect’s model lays out something you can build. But the choreography on the stage? The painting on the wall? These are cut off from dancing, or showing, or learning. They stop you dead in your tracks. That is, if you let them. If you suspend. If you interrupt. If you enter that special space and that altered state that art provides or allows. Art situations have this in common with religious spaces like churches. They are places where so much can happen but only because nothing really happens. They are spaces for self-transformation.

>Art interrupts, makes strange, and so subverts.
>This is one of the reasons why pornographic art is almost a contradiction in terms, as I mentioned before. Porn has a clear function; it is meant to turn you on. And to do that it needs to offer you images, ideas, fantasies, and opportunities to be what you are—sexually aroused, for example. Pornography leaves you and everything else as it finds you.

>This is also one of the reasons why architecture—thought of in the Renaissance as the queen of the arts—is in many ways the most uncomfortable of all the arts. Always on the verge of collapsing into mere design, into the functional managing of human need and habit and practical life. It isn’t surprising, when you think about it, that the buildings of great architects have leaky roofs and doors that don’t quite close. Sound roofs and well-fitted doors are tools par excellence, tools whose excellence requires the perfect match to the prefigured need of the user. But artists are always concerned to abrogate just that, to disturb everything that is already, as a matter of habit and background, in place.
>A true art of architecture would make uninhabitable spaces. And if there is a pornographic art, whatever else is true of it, it will not be good for masturbating.

>But this is an extreme case of what is always at work wherever there is art. The lights dim. You are fixed to your seat. And now you must make something of what there is. If you can.
>Most artists, but maybe not Cage, are motivated to work more directly with your desires and curiosities, with your natural tendencies to pay attention and then lose focus, to keep you entertained, at least to some degree. But the engagement with the work is always, necessarily, the most fragile thing imaginable.

>I return to popular art—with emphasis on popular music—in a later chapter. I agree with the New York gallerist Jeffrey Deitch that fashion, rock and roll, graffiti, the art of the street are now vitally bound up with what art is for us. But it is a problem, for us, and for art, to understand how or why this can be. For a nonesoteric art, an art that doesn’t cloak itself in invisibility, an art that seems to be free for the taking, an art that revolts against boredom and displeasure seems to be no art at all. For what can art give us if it just turns us on, makes us feel good, and leaves us as it finds us?

## 10 Art and the Limits of Neuroscience

The world shows up, in experience, not like a picture in the head. It shows up, rather, as the playing field or arena for our activity. Not the brain’s activity. Our activity. Not activity inside our head, but activity in the world around us. Our concern is with the active life of the whole, embodied, environmentally and socially situated animal.

The possibility that maybe we need finally to get out of our heads to explain or make sense of human experience is not even considered as a live option. We just assume that the membrane dividing brain and environment is somehow the causally critical division between self and world. This is, I think, to borrow a phrase of Dennett’s, “a dead giveaway of vestigial Cartesian materialism” that still holds neuroscience captive.

## 11.  Art Is a Philosophical Practice and Philosophy an Aesthetic One


If art is a subspecies of philosophy, or if—as I would put it—each is a subspecies of a larger genus, then it shouldn’t surprise us that art, like philosophy, is a field of disputation. Art and philosophy share a common aim: self-transformation and the achievement of understanding.

Finally, as we have already considered at length, art can be very boring; it is always liable to bore us to tears. If works of art are strange tools, if art happens with the disruption of business as usual, always demanding that we look differently and try to see what we don’t quite know how to see, then it isn’t surprising that we run the risk of failing to see anything at all and just finding ourselves trapped and disengaged with the works around us and with our lives.

## 12. Making Pictures

Pictures, in at least one of their main varieties, are distinctively visual; they target the world as it shows up for us by way of sight. (More on nonvisual pictures later!) But pictures are not about looks. They are ways of displaying what we see, that is, things we care about (for whatever reason).

It is the simple, almost too-evident-to-state fact that we make pictures. We don’t find them. They aren’t natural occurrences in the way that reflections in the surface of a pond or on the chrome of my bicycle handle are natural occurrences, or the way a shadow on the wall is a natural occurrence. We don’t stumble upon pictures. We produce them. They are artifacts. Bits of manufacture. Many of our picture-making devices—the digital or photographic camera—exploit phenomena of natural image making, reflection, and the like. It is a general fact about technologies that they harness nature and put to work our understanding of natural phenomena, as the Santa Fe Institute economist W. Brian Arthur has stressed. The point is that pictures are products of human handiwork, and picture making is a technological practice. A picture, in brief, is a tool.

The multiplicity of uses to which we put pictures doesn’t mean we cannot usefully generalize. Pictures are tools for showing things, for putting things on display. This generalization captures the basic function of picture making without flattening out or ignoring the great diversity of background contexts that motivate and condition the practice of picture making. After all, why do we want to show something? We get all the diverse specificity we want when we try to answer this question.

What is noteworthy about all these phenomena—as I’ve argued elsewhere—is that your nature as a person, or as a man, say, the hidden parts of the solid opaque objects I see, the meaning of the words, all show up for me thanks not to what projects into my eyes but to what I know and what I can do. I have access to the detail in the room, to the other side of the tomato, to your personhood, to the meanings of your words, and the ground of my access is my knowledge, my know-how, my ability (for example) to read, my mastery of pertinent concepts.
The very idea that vision is an optical process, one that consists, as Pinker suggests, in the receipt of an image, is itself a kind of ur-myth that we’ve been telling and retelling even though it barely makes sense. Seeing is no more about having images in mind than touching is. Seeing you is just another way of encountering you. Seeing isn’t something that happens in us. It is something we do. And like everything else we do, it depends on where we are, whom we’re with, what we know, what we want, and what there is.
So how do we use and understand pictures? How do we see with them?

## 13. Using Models

Watson and Crick’s model enabled scientists to just see how the structure of the DNA molecule enabled a certain pattern of information storage and exchange during biological growth. And the balsa wood house is very useful in showing, say, the scale of the house and its various proportions. But it conveys nothing about materials and very little about landscaping and the like. The crucial point is that models are ways of exploring the world or accomplishing certain goals. We use the model to pose and answer questions. A model is useful, successful, accurate just insofar as it achieves a purpose.

+ thinking here about constructing a model for attending to practice?
+ he also mentions proxies (and maps!)


What justifies our selection of a model is the particular needs and interests that motivate us in the first place. Maps are models, and we select maps at different scales depending on what we’re trying to do. All sorts of factors may influence our assemblages for purposes of modeling and investigating.

We can appreciate, then, that a critical feature of models, whether in science or in tabletop conversations, is that they achieve their work only against the background of shared context.

## 14. Pictorial Strategies

When it comes to pictures that are also works of art, only one thing is clear: you can’t tell just by looking. The work of art isn’t visible to first inspection. It requires interrogation. Returning to our slogan, the artwork says: See me if you can! And it gives you the resources you need to try.

## 15. Air Guitar Styles

But there is a different musical ideal that is, as a matter of fact, no less influential in our culture. It is lively and important, although it is never really made explicit; it bears no name. According to this different ideal, the artist is not a vehicle for music; instead, the music is a vehicle for the artist. Music, accordingly, is a mechanism for the artist’s display of himself or herself.

When it comes to art, the question we need to ask is: In what does the work of art consist? Or better: Where is the work happening? 

In its original, etymological meaning, a person is a mask; from there this word (“person”) acquired the meaning of a role, as in, the role played in a drama by an actor who wears a mask (as in “dramatis personae”). The face of a person is a mask, and the person, in truth, is a role, not the one who plays the role. This idea connects to other crucial ideas.
First, John Locke argued that person is a “forensic” concept. By this he meant that a person is, in its basic conception, the bearer of responsibility, the actor, the one deserving of praise or blame. For Locke the point was that a person is not the biological animal—the man or woman—but rather the agent. Again, as with the idea of person as role rather than player, we have the idea that personhood is something social, something performed, something undertaken. Something defined, crucially, in relation to praise, blame, and evaluation. So persons are citizens, they are fathers and mothers, they are employers and employees, they are baseball players and philosophers. They are these things. That is, these are the roles we play, better or worse, successfully or unsuccessfully, in our social lives. We are persons insofar as we are subject, always and implicitly, to the standards of our community.

## 17. A Very Abbreviated and Highly Opinionated History of Aesthetics

But also, Plato is a philosopher, and philosophy, as I have been arguing, is by its very nature an artistic project. For philosophy, like art, is in the business of bringing out our organization and reorganizing us.
Plato is exactly right that art threatens to disorganize the soul. But where he goes astray, we are now in a position to appreciate, is in thinking this disorganizing and reorganizing is always harmful. Where he is right is in his appreciating that it belongs to the very nature of art (and philosophy) to be harmful potentially. Art and philosophy are serious business.


What is activated in such a film are our responses and our thoughts not about actual events but about possible ones, or perhaps our responses to our responses to possible events, to ways things might have been or might be or might unfold. There is room for error here, too, of course. But not factual error. Ignorance of the facts is no obstacle to productive investigation of the meaning, for us, of war, torture, etc.
Aristotle appreciated this point exactly. Art is more profound than history for Aristotle, precisely because it is concerned with more than just what happened, with what is true. It is concerned with what is possible, with what could possibly happen, and so, with a more fundamental reality; it lets us think about the real natures of things that constrain and determine what can happen. Art looks at things not under the aspect of their being true, or real, or having actually happened. It looks at things in the light of all the different sorts of significance they could possibly have. Every play, every poem, every painting, for Aristotle, is a thought experiment, and its value, as such, is, at root, philosophical.

x- relates to critical realism: actual ... what is possible 

It is the hallmark of our existence, as Heidegger said, that we are a problem to ourselves. Heidegger was clear, as few other thinkers have been, that the work art does is philosophical. Its job is bringing into the open, and putting on display, and at the same time instituting and so setting up, the structures and values that, as I would put it, organize us. It reveals organization and it also reorganizes.

It is precisely our engagement with what we take for granted that allows us, then, to carry on taking it for granted. You can’t eliminate philosophy and art because philosophy and art are the ways we create precisely the worlds which, at some moments, thanks to this normative work, we can then let recede from view and reside comfortably in the background.

And yet, crucially for Kant, as we have noticed, there can be no objective test of whether a thing is deserving of our aesthetic praise. Aesthetic value is not a feature of a thing, like its weight or color, that we can detect or perceive or discover.
But this means that aesthetic disagreement is never really about the art thing itself; it is about our response to the thing. That is why Kant describes aesthetic response as a “free play of the imagination.” The thing doesn’t dictate how we experience it the way that the fact that a thing is a car dictates that we come to learn it is a car when we inspect it.
What is at stake, finally, in aesthetic evaluation, is what kind of person you are. That is why aesthetic disagreement, when it is unresolvable, can spell the breakdown of a relationship. And it is also why art requires of us that we commit ourselves to the importance of conversation and criticism.

And this brings us back to philosophy. Philosophical disagreement is, in exactly this way, aesthetic. You can’t prove a philosophical position any more than you can prove that a painting is or is not a worthwhile work of art. For what’s at stake, finally, is you, and your commitments, and what you need to see your way clear of the puzzlements and confusions that hold you captive.
The fact that philosophy is not a science, that it does not admit of experimental methods or other forms of decision procedures that settle the facts, once and for all, does not mean that philosophical disagreements are not real. They are real. They are objective. But what’s at stake is not the facts. What is at stake is how we assimilate, make sense of and, finally, evaluate the facts.
Art has value, then, exactly as philosophy has value. Not because it produces knowledge in the way that science does. But precisely because it is the domain in which we grapple with what we already know (or think we know). It is the domain in which we try to get clear about the ways we think and respond and assign value.
Just as choreography isn’t dancing, so philosophical investigation and aesthetic criticism are not domains in which we gather more facts. They are domains in which we try to put ourselves as information gatherers, as perceivers and, indeed, as perceivers whose evaluations may very well tend to be interested and biased, on display before ourselves.

The thing about experiences that are, in this way, thematically structured and integral is that they are achievements. We make them. We don’t just have them. We manage them. If you think of living as a stream of doing, and undergoing, then the achievement of meaning and integration that is characteristic of our actual lived experiences is a thing of value.
Every experience, insofar as it is an experience, is integral. It has form and meaning. And it is made. It is achieved. In other words, for Dewey, it is aesthetic. Life itself is a meaning-making activity. All experience, insofar as it is experience, happens in an aesthetic space. For to be integral, to be integrated, to be organized, is to be aesthetic.

The work of art puts our fundamental nature as makers, that is to say, as experiencers, on display. The work of art exhibits our manner of organization to ourselves and it does so in a comprehensible and recognizable way.
I opened this book with a quote from Dewey. He expresses this idea: it is the existence of art objects themselves that gets in the way of understanding the nature of art. We look to the things themselves. But art is experience. It isn’t the things that matter. It is the experience of those things. But those experiences don’t come for free. We need to make them. Art is an opportunity to make experience, to make ourselves, and so to live.

Art is not manufacture. Art is not performance. Art is not entertainment. Art is not beauty. Art is not pleasure. Art is not participation in the art world. And art is definitely not commerce.
Art is philosophy. Art is putting our true nature on display before ourselves. Because we need to. Art is writing ourselves.
