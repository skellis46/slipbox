# Kampe - Eros and inquiry: the Feldenkrais Method as a complex resource

_previous note:_ [[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

This writing is an overview of Kampe's use of the Feldenkrais method (including Awareness through movement and Functional integration) in his dancing and acting teaching practice. It summarises some of the claims made on behalf of the practice, and uses a series of transcriptions from his past students about their experience of the practice. 

It's a useful overview of the method (well-referenced) that focuses on what FM _can_ do or might make possible. It assumes a causal relationship between the practice and the experiences of the student. 

The writing does not adopt a critical tone or voice re FM and Kampe's own teaching practice. The voice is circumspect (not wanting to make unsubstantiable claims?) while also  being overwhelmingly positive about the benefits of FM.
