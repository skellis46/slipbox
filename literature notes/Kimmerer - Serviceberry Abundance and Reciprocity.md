# Robin Wall Kimmerer - The Serviceberry Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World

_previous note:_ [[Pollan - In Defence of Food]]

> Ethnobotanists know that the more names a plant has, the greater its cultural importance.

> Imagine a fruit that tastes like a Blueberry crossed with the satisfying heft of an Apple, a touch of rosewater, and a minuscule crunch of almond-flavored seeds. They taste like nothing a grocery store has to offer: wild, complex with a flavor that your body recognizes as the real food it’s been waiting for. I can almost feel my mitochondria doing a happy dance when I eat them.

> In the Anishinaabe worldview, it’s not just fruits that are understood as gifts, rather all of the sustenance that the land provides, from fish to firewood. Everything that makes our lives possible—the splints for baskets, roots for medicines, the trees whose bodies make our homes, and the pages of our books—is provided by the lives of more-than-human beings. This is always true whether it’s harvested directly from the forest or whether it’s mediated by commerce and harvested from the shelves of a store—it all comes from the Earth. When we speak of these not as things or natural resources or commodities, but as gifts, our whole relationship to the natural world changes.

> Recognizing “enoughness” is a radical act in an economy that is always urging us to consume more.

> Ecopsychologists have shown that the practice of gratitude puts brakes on hyperconsumption.

> If the Sun is the source of flow in the economy of nature, what is the “Sun” of a human gift economy, the source that constantly replenishes the flow of gifts? Maybe it is love.

> thinking. I imagine if we acknowledged that everything we consume is the gift of Mother Earth, we would take better care of what we are given.

> Why then have we permitted the dominance of economic systems that commoditize everything? That create scarcity instead of abundance, that promote accumulation rather than sharing?

> Our metrics of economic value like GDP count only monetary value in the marketplace, of that which can be bought and sold. There is no room in these equations for the economic value of clean air and carbon sequestration and the ineffable riches of a forest filled with birdsong.

> I’m way past high school, but I’m not sure I grasp that thinking, so I fill a bowl with fresh Serviceberries for my friend and colleague Dr. Valerie Luzadis. She is an appreciator of earthly gifts and a professor and past president of the U.S. Society for Ecological Economics. Ecological economics is a growing field that integrates Earth’s natural systems and human values and ethics into conventional economic theory. Valerie prefers to define economics as “how we organize ourselves to sustain life and enhance its quality. It’s a way of considering how we provide for ourselves.” I like that better.

> The words “ecology” and “economy” come from the same root, the Greek oikos, meaning “home” or “household”: i.e., the systems of relationship, the goods and services that keep us alive.

> Potlatches were seen as contrary to “the civilized values of accumulation” and undermined the notions of individual property and advancement essential to assimilation to the colonial agenda.

> The whole enterprise of dispossession and assimilation of the original peoples was designed to eradicate the notion of land as a source of belonging and to replace it with the idea that land is nothing more than a source of belongings. This required a narrowing of the definition of well-being, from common wealth to individual wealth, from abundance to scarcity.

> There are many examples of functioning gift economies—most in small societies of close relations, where community well-being is recognized as the “unit” of success—where the interest of “we” exceeds that of “I.” In this time when economies have grown so large and impersonal that they extinguish rather than nurture community well-being, perhaps we should consider other ways to organize the exchange of goods and services which constitutes an economy.

> The groundbreaking work of economist Elinor Ostrom showed that land can sustain those resources held in common without either state intervention or market economies. Defying the long-held theory, her work showed that collective action, trust, and cooperation can lead to the mutual well-being of land and people without degrading commonly held resources. For this challenge to economic doctrine, Dr. Ostrom was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. This is economics that a botanist can love!

> If we think of the Earth as a big warehouse of commodities, as mere objects, we claim a kind of privilege to exploit what we believe that we own. In that property mindset, how we consume doesn’t really matter because it’s just stuff and the stuff all belongs to us. There is no moral constraint on consumption. And so, we find ourselves in a time of ecological and spiritual depletion.

> Let’s remember that the “System” is led by individuals, by a relatively small number of people, who have names, with more money than God and certainly less compassion. They sit in boardrooms deciding to exploit fossil fuels for short-term gain while the world burns. They know the science, they know the consequences, but they proceed with ecocidal business as usual and do it anyway.

> I lament my own immersion in an economy that grinds what is beautiful and unique into dollars, converts gifts to commodities in a currency that enables us to purchase things we don’t really need while destroying what we do.

> Supporting a thriving bird community is essential to the well-being of the Serviceberry and everyone else up and down the food chain. That seems especially important to an immobile, long-lived being like a tree, who can’t run away from ruptured relationships. Thriving is possible only if you have nurtured strong bonds with your community.

> Valerie says that “ecological economics emerged after observing [how the] neoclassical economic approach fails to provide for everyone and does not adequately consider the ecosystems that are our life support. We’ve created a system such that we self-identify as consumers first before understanding ourselves as ecosystem citizens. In ecological economics, the focus is on creating an economy that provides for a just and sustainable future in which both human life and nonhuman life can flourish.”

> It is a gift, to be shared by all, and the notion of owning water is an ecological and ethical travesty. Lewis Hyde writes, “To assign a market value to a gift, destroys the gift.”

> The ongoing reciprocity in gifting stretches beyond the next customer, though, into a whole web of relations that are not transactional. Paulie and Ed are banking goodwill, so-called social capital. “Being known as a citizen is always of value,” she says. If someone leaves a gate open and her sheep end up in my garden, there’s a cushion of goodwill in place so that the munched dahlias may be forgiven.

> I cherish the notion of the gift economy, that we might back away from the grindi
