# gibson and roche - and then again I draw myself to the detail

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM: 

This article looks at how dancers experience very subtle, fast-changing inner states while they are moving, and asks how those experiences can be shared with others. Gibson and Roche argue that even a brief movement contains layers of sensation, imagery, attention and spatial awareness that usually remain invisible. Through their project Expanded Fields they explore ways of making these layers more perceptible, not by explaining them but by creating conditions where dancers and audiences can sense them differently. The work combines live performance with video, sound and virtual reality so that movement is encountered as something felt and imagined, not just watched.

The authors describe how somatic practices and micro-phenomenological methods helped dancers notice and reflect on these fleeting states, and how this noticing fed directly into the artistic process. By placing dance in a gallery and VR environment, the audience can choose how close or distant they are from the movement, shifting between seeing a dancer as a person and experiencing movement as an expanded, immersive field. The article concludes that digital and spatial technologies can loosen the idea of the body as a fixed object, allowing dance to be experienced as a distributed, relational process that moves between inner sensation and shared space rather than sitting neatly in one place or medium.
