# Diane Musho Hamilton - Compassionate Conversations How to Speak and Listen From the Heart

_previous note:_

> Research in adult development reveals that values vary tremendously from person to person and from group to group, and our ability to hold more than one perspective while in conversation also varies.

> This miracle is the process of evolution that Alfred North Whitehead refers to as the “creative advance into novelty.”2

> We want to talk about the objective world but include our subjective, lived experience, our feelings and emotions, and we want to cultivate empathy and compassion for others in our conversations. It’s a tall order.

> Some recent research conducted by Google concluded that the most productive teams at that company were the ones in which team members felt the most psychologically safe.5 This meant that team members could take risks, make mistakes, and expose their individual vulnerabilities and confusion without feeling like they would be punished or reprimanded. This need for safety is deep in the hardwiring of human beings and is essential, the research found, for creating environments that are conducive to creative, high-performing teams.

**Note:** Creativity

> Spiritual awakening is the deep discovery that we are not fundamentally separate from others, nor are we essentially different from them. Our deepest nature is the same. All of us, the stars and the great earth, and all the various beings in our world, from the tiniest molecule to the immense universe, are one thing. This realization creates tremendous peace in the heart and gives rise to true compassion. In this way we are never strangers to one another, and the circle of care and concern extends naturally to everyone.

> There are no differences but differences of degree between different degrees of difference and no difference. —William James, “The Will to Believe”


When we explore our differences, acknowledging them, getting to know them, we create a deeper functioning wholeness, equality, and social coherence


Gabe agreed about inclusiveness but cautioned, “We can never be really inclusive if we can’t address our differences, whether they are economic, racial, gendered, religious, and so on. If we don’t, we create a shallow togetherness based on trying to be and stay the same.”


This occurs all over the world because as humans we have persistent patterns of noticing our differences and then judging those who are not like us.4 When we attempt to have conversations about race, gender, politics, or religion, we are not simply talking about our differences. We are also talking about how we value and devalue them, how we wield power, and how we dominate, subjugate, and inflict suffering on one another.


Surprising as it may be, just discussing differences often feels threatening. Conversations about differences can easily provoke a fight-or-flight response; instead of a dose of relaxing, feel-good hormones, the rush of adrenalin and other stress hormones pervade the body, increasing the heart rate, flushing the skin, tightening the jaws and shoulder muscles, activating the limbs, and even inducing trembling. These are highly uncomfortable sensations. Sometimes people cry. There is often aggression or defensiveness in our voice. It is difficult to listen when there are stress hormones present in the body; access to the prefrontal cortex is impeded, making it almost impossible to think clearly or hold multiple perspectives. Memory is affected, too, sometimes making it difficult to remember that we actually like the person we’re talking to. The evolutionary purpose of this bodily reaction is to provide a boost of energy for movement, for a quick, defensive response, and for protection. Usually when we feel triggered our first impulse is to move away or defend.


The first is to become very interested in the firsthand experience of fight or flight in our own body. We can learn to stay present with that heightened state and get really curious about what the actual physical sensations are. Where are they located in the body? What is their texture and tone? Are they hot or clenching or rushing or throbbing? How do they shift and change? What is our tone of voice? Is there a sudden gripping in the chest or heat around the throat or neck? Can we feel the sensations of aggression rise in the body and throat? Or the opposite: Do the contractions of fear show up in the solar plexus or stomach? Do we sense a negative shift in our feelings toward other people? Does a sense of separation set in?


To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget the self. —Zen Master Dogen, “Genjokoan”


Identity refers to the “totality of one’s self-construal,”1 or more simply, the totality of what we recognize as “me.” It holds all of our important experiences; it links our past to our future and connects us to our people and ancestors, to their triumphs and struggles. Identity has many different dimensions, including personal, cultural, national, gender, and so forth. It provides stability to our life through its set of orienting beliefs and ideas, collection of memories and stories, roles and expectations, as well as positive and negative experiences. All in all, identity is the story that we tell ourselves and others about who and what we are.


Some models of adult development are very complex, containing many phases. But in a rudimentary model, identity moves through four basic stages: egocentric, ethnocentric, worldcentric, and Kosmocentric. Through this simple model our sense of self grows from smaller to larger, encompassing more and more experience.


At this level of development, what is “me” includes all the people who are important to me, from my children and family, to my friends, coworkers, and teammates—all the people who give me a larger sense of myself. Ethnocentric identity varies and includes our family, clan or tribe, nation, religious group, or even a business or sports team.


The downside of the ethnocentric identity, of course, includes rigidity, as though there is only one truth, and it just happens to be ours. There is little room for exploration or for asking questions, so blind conformity and dogmatism rule, and the oppression of “nonbelievers” and the quashing of individuality or independence is also common.


The next wave of development that unfolds is worldcentrism. At this stage we begin to identify with all of humanity rather than our own group. We recognize the same aspirations and suffering in ourselves and others and begin to act on the basis of universal human values. We see national, racial, religious, and other differences, but these don’t result in hard divisions.


Worldcentric conversations usually have room to exchange multiple perspectives. People can think in terms of “both/and” rather than “either/or.” There is far more curiosity, questioning, and exploring than earlier stages. But when identity is at stake, when we are our perspective and our preferences rather than having them, we feel threatened by differences and grip tightly to our own truth in response. Identity is not usually negotiable. We may see others as being well-intentioned but also confused, wrong, or even harmful.


Usually at this stage we are engaged in spiritual practice, have been through a life-changing experience, or have confronted our own death. We can see ourselves as part of the great flux of coming into being and passing away, and we have trust in the profound process of life and death.


THE PRACTICE Explore different levels of identity by completing the following sentences. As the egocentric identity, what I notice is… As the ethnocentric self, what I am proud of is…and what I am ashamed of is… As the worldcentric identity, I am interested in…and what I am overwhelmed by is… As the Kosmocentric self, what I am aware of is…


While each person has a piece of the truth, these personal perspectives are partially true. And it’s important that we distinguish our personal opinions from our shared perceptions and the relevant, verifiable third-person truths in any conversation.


In the internet age we face new, significant challenges related to truth. Ken Wilber says that we are in a “legitimation crisis,”7 a situation where personal opinions and cultural beliefs are becoming increasingly mismatched with reality. As Wilber says, “A culture that is lying to its members simply cannot move forward for long. And if a culture has ‘no truth,’ it has no idea when it’s lying—and thus it naturally lies as many times as it accidentally tells the truth.”8


Now, if you need help improving your upload speeds, the web is eager to help with technical details. But if you are struggling with depression, it may goad you into killing yourself.” This is referred to as the “disinhibition effect,” in which factors like anonymity, invisibility, lack of authority, and not communicating in real time strip away the civility (second person) and the reliability (third person) that society has spent generations building.


He remembered a quote from Zen master Dogen: “If you cannot find the truth right where you are, where do you expect to find it?”1


Having a clear intention will literally help us navigate our conversations when we encounter difficult terrain. To enter a conversation (other than one that is simply social) without an intention is like walking into the wilderness without a compass. And yet we engage in conversations all the time without having one, sometimes without even the vaguest idea of how we would like the conversation to go. Rather than being clear as to what we want, whether it’s to assert our truth, to exchange perspectives, to expand our understanding, to learn about another person’s life, or to practice listening, we go in blind and end up stumbling all over the place.


The newcomer’s name was Lloyd Fickett, and he introduced Diane to the ground rules he writes about in his work The Collaborative Way: A Story about Engaging the Mind and Spirit of a Company.2


Being for each other serves as a cognitive cue that can literally help us stay connected to others through the ups and downs of difficult conversations.


Here, the Dalai Lama’s advice is helpful: “All others’ desires are the same as mine. Every being wants happiness and does not want suffering.”5 All people want to be heard, to feel respected and valued. Remembering this, it’s easy to practice being for each other.


Reflective listening is simple and involves just two steps: First, the listener opens up to hear and fully receive the speaker’s message. Second, the listener repeats the message back to the speaker to confirm that it was understood accurately. This is listen well, a very simple skill, and it is golden. Unfortunately, we tend not to do it.


As one Zen master said, The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are both absent, everything becomes clear and undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.8


In other words, people were allowed to speak, to remember, and to feel, while the others simply listened and witnessed, without blame or judgment. In the words of the famous Gestalt psychologist Fritz Perls, “Awareness per se of and by itself can be curative.”7 Being held in others’ attention in the circle unconditionally supported healing.


The way that we remember our own life-shattering events is important. There is immense power in retelling and integrating such events. There is a danger, of course, that we become so identified with our pain that we create more suffering for ourselves. While it is important to acknowledge the ways in which we may have been traumatized, it is also important not to assume the identity of a victim.


A Tibetan Buddhist teacher says, “If an arrow wounds you, you can blame the one who shot the arrow for your injury. But if you then take that arrow and grind it deeper and deeper into your wound, that is your own doing.”


In Zen we cultivate this recognition of what is known as emptiness, the freedom from our stories, identity, and self-referencing.


There are times in conversation when slowing down and simply feeling for a moment can be extremely helpful. It is sometimes relieving to pause and turn our attention directly to the body, noticing just the physical sensations. We can ask ourselves, Where are the sensations located? What is their texture or qualities? How they are moving or changing? Once sensation is experienced directly, we can ask for the name of the feeling, eliciting words like fear, anger, or sadness.


Fear is essentially the pure recognition that we are alive and subject to being hurt and dying. Fear can be viewed as the emotion that connects us to the intrinsic fact of our life, to its value and the deep, unwavering instinct to preserve it.


When there is fear present in conversation and it is unacknowledged, it has a stifling effect. People will stammer, and their speech will become halting. Speakers appear to be second-guessing themselves, and the flow of energy stops. There is stress in the conversation, and strain.


He refers to sadness as “loss taken to heart.”6


When we begin to work with our feelings, we usually inhabit one of two polarities: we either dwell or drown in emotions, or we attempt to bypass feelings entirely. We all have the capacity to feel and emote, as well as to ignore or disregard feelings.


Little children are good examples of how emotions can come and go quickly. They emote fully, and they recalibrate easily when comforted because they are not yet anchored to cognitive narratives that keep emotions alive. Developing emotional maturity means that we have learned to experience the sensations and feelings directly, allowing them to blossom and inform, and release them without a trace. The challenge for adults is to let go of the thoughts that energize the emotions when they are no longer useful.


Rick Hanson, a writer on the neuroscience of happiness,11 says, “The brain is like Velcro for negative experiences but Teflon for positive experiences.” He notes that one negative interaction in an important relationship is five times more powerful than a positive interaction.


Practice the seven-step process on emotional transmutation. Remember that the first three steps are related to letting the emotion be, without repressing or changing it. Then we suspend the narrative and with the help of the breath, begin self-regulation. As the body begins to calm down, we can then ask, What is right about this feeling? This should result in a fresh perspective on the emotional response.


So Diane said to him, “I agree that there are contexts and situations when flatter, more distributed governance structures can enhance how we collaborate and work together. But verticality also has its benefits, especially when it comes to efficiency, clarity, and maintaining energy with a strong sense of direction.”


Power, in our conversations, refers to the ability to galvanize energy, influence others, and mobilize resources to achieve desired goals.


Diane has learned a lot from Randee, particularly about the specific ways to spot one-up/one-down dynamics in conversation. Randee says that when we are in the position of being one-up, we are confident and comfortable in ourselves and our perspective. We might even feel smug, like we are on the inside and understand the rules of the game. We feel free to sit back, relax, and contribute, or not. When we do speak first, we will often set the tone for engagement. Usually we are less emotional when we are on top, more able to be rational, chill, and less easily offended. Often, however, we may fail to see the problem at hand; in fact, we may not even acknowledge the perspectives of others, but instead stick to our own viewpoint. We may judge others for being overly reactive or too sensitive and feel that it is our job to help everyone get on with the agenda.


Julie Diamond, another student of Arnold Mindell, has written a very valuable book called Power: A User’s Guide, in which she explores the path of a conscious relationship to power.


I acknowledge the privilege of being alive in a human body at this moment, endowed with senses, memories, emotions, thoughts, and the space of mind in its wisdom aspect. —Alex Grey, “The Vast Expanse”


Kwame Anthony Appiah, a British-born, Ghanaian-American philosopher and cultural theorist, writes about the importance of expanding the range of our ethical concerns to include people in other parts of the world.5 This expansion of our awareness to others around the globe is an act of compassion, an opening of the heart to include others.


We swim in a vast ocean of privilege, as Alex Grey, a visionary artist, author, and Buddhist teacher, points out; this is because we are alive, because we have “senses, memories, emotions, thoughts, and most importantly, the space of mind in its wisdom aspect.”10


The problem is that we think we are great listeners until we hear something that isn’t consistent with our current thinking. Then we become tense, contracted, and defensive, and the conversation fails to expand into new territory.


Good listening always involves emptying out, becoming present, receiving the message, and reflecting back what we’ve heard.


Once we’re able to calm down and listen to an opinion that differs from our own, we can take the next step and look for a partial truth. Asking the question “What’s right about what’s being said?” is a good start.


Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen, who teach at Harvard Law School and the Harvard Negotiation Project, make a very important distinction between intention and impact. They assert that we can feel a negative impact, and without minimizing it, not presume a negative intention. And then we may find our way to a clarification or resolution that we didn’t expect.9


Conflict is difficult, but it can be useful. When we clash with others it heightens our attention, exposes our perspectives, and highlights where we need to grow.


Uncomfortable as they are, these conflicts are a tremendous source of wisdom, showing us how much we care, and at the same time, how limited our views are, regardless of our certainty about them. We have to remember that all perspectives are true, but partial. As soon as we can see this, we can begin to expand our viewpoints.


Conflict is an indication that either side of an argument is pretending to be the whole story.


Robert Kegan, a developmental psychologist and research professor at Harvard, explains it this way: “Conflict is a likely consequence of one or both of us making prior, true, distinct, and whole our partial position…a reminder of our tendency to pretend to completeness when we are, in fact, incomplete. We may have this conflict because we need it to recover our truer complexity.”1


The physiological, mental, and energetic stress can make leaning into conflict a highly counterintuitive move. And yet, it is only through our relationships, building up more stamina and willingness to navigate the discomfort together, that we can harness the creative potential of conflict to propel our own and our collective growth.


Let’s recall that to work constructively with conflict, we must make a new relationship with the body. The fight-or-flight response is intense and disruptive, and managing the sensations that arise from adrenalin and cortisol takes practice.


Since fight or flight compromises our skills, it’s very important that we calm down first and then practice turn-taking in our communications. When the nervous system is calm, listening is far easier. When emotions abate, we can hold multiple views. When the mind settles down, we remember that we are committed to one another’s well-being. In other words, by regulating our nervous system, we can more easily remember that we are for each other.


But too much attachment to identity can also create separation and suffering. We may habitually behave as an advocate when being a friend is better. We may stand up for our racial or gender differences when acknowledging our common humanity creates more calm, ease, and connection. We may identify with the suffering of the past when the present moment is filled with beauty and substance. Or we may identify with the fighter in us when the peacemaker is who’s needed.


If we mean to have conversations that matter to us online, we would be wise to practice emotional and social maturity. This means taking responsibility for our reactions, pausing to reflect, slowing down, listening carefully, and always leaving room in our mind for the possibility that we may have misunderstood the message.


THE PRACTICE 1. Think about your last conflict. 2. What identity was most activated in you? For example, were you a parent, a partner, an employer, a friend? 3. Is there another identity that could have had a role in that conflict? 4. How would the conflict have changed if you had shifted to a different identity?


Another way to think about the ego is that it maintains homeostasis in the body-mind. In biology, homeostasis refers to stability within a cell or a body. Just as the cell keeps a balanced internal environment by adjusting to conditions and resisting change, so the ego adjusts constantly to affronts and challenges to it, recalibrating often in order to stay as close as possible to a set point. The ego creates an equilibrium in our self-image and lends stability to how we see ourselves.


This perspective applies not just to our individual ego but to our collective self-identity. Members of groups constantly push away information that challenges the stability of their group identity, and like the individual, they maintain their self-concept within a familiar range.


But to grow up, mature, and change, the ego must be disrupted. It must expand to include more positive versions of the self, and at the same time it must accommodate aspects of the self that it would rather not consider.


In this process of maturation, we no longer experience our self as fixed or solid but as flexing and flowing according to situations and conditions. Paradoxically, one develops more confidence in oneself and, at the same time, is deeply humbled by the lessons of ego development.


One of the greatest disruptors of the equilibrium of the ego is the shadow. In Jungian psychology, shadow refers to aspects of the personality that remain out of the light of awareness because we find them unacceptable, shameful, or dark, the opposite of how we like to think of ourself.1 In Ken Wilber’s usage, the word shadow is any part of our self that we cannot hold in our first person “I” and is usually projected onto others who are not like “me.”


But through social conditioning and other life pressures, some aspects of our self pose a threat to our self-image. They are too painful, too shameful, or simply too unacceptable to contain.


Of course, this group of friends probably couldn’t see the irony, but that’s the effect of shadow: We can’t see it. We can’t see how, when we attempt to protect, we can oppress. Or how, when we stand for tolerance, we become intolerant. Or when we promote understanding, we fail to understand.4


There is little room to make mistakes or inhabit nuances, shades of gray, or paradoxes because there are certain dogmas that must be adhered to. Some conversations that purport to be open are not at all open because there is almost no room for differing opinions.


Suddenly, the foreboding sense of shame and blame gives way to the recognition that everyone is, to some degree, complicit in creating human suffering, and is therefore capable of helping to relieve it.


Remember: to grow up, the ego must be disrupted, so we must learn to include aspects of our self-identity that we would rather not consider.


Every conversation about trauma or abuse would be well served if it included an acknowledgment of the miracle of our resilience and the remarkable capacity for redemption in the human experience.


We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. —Martin Luther King Jr., Strength to Love


Desmond Tutu defined forgiveness as the act of abandoning our right to resentment and revenge, and opening to those who have harmed us in order to make a new beginning together


Most importantly, we forgive in order to release our hearts and minds from the trap of resentment and hatred.


words of Martin Luther King Jr., who said, “Within the best of us, there is some evil, and within the worst of us, there is some good.”11 Which is to say, people of color are not purely good, and white people are not purely bad. Mark invited them to close their eyes and visualize their ancestors standing behind them.


As Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Forgiveness is not an occasional act; it is a permanent attitude.”12


Love, compassion, patience, and equanimity soften the harsh realities of the world.


Vietnamese Zen teacher Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us to be grateful for our pain and suffering, as they are necessary for us to understand the wholeness of our experience.2 In other words, to create space for our suffering and struggles is to become wholehearted.


In Chinese, the word xin translates as both “heart” and “mind,” but depending on the context it can also mean “core,” “intention,” or “emotion.”


The poet bell hooks questioned people about what force in their lives had compelled them to make a profound transformation, from a will to dominate to a will to be compassionate. They all reported that the transformation occurred as a result of experiences grounded in love.6

**Note:** Gottlieb


Compassion, on the other hand, also feels the pain of others, but unlike empathy, there is no distress signal in the brain. Because of this difference, compassion can actually preserve and reinforce the calmness of the mind.15 And in this way, compassion is a renewable resource.16 Furthermore, we can train in generating compassion, thus relieving the burnout that results from empathy alone.


We seek to evolve conversation so that we can move fluidly between our ego identification, our ethnocentric loyalties, our worldcentric cares, and the freedom and calm that a Kosmocentric perspective brings us.


We learn to relax in our profound sameness, explore our vivid and exceptional differences, and become confident in the durability of our relationships. We practice flexibility in our perspective, loosening the grip of calcified stories and ideas about who we and those people are. We listen more honestly and clearly, without clouding the message with hidden biases and past impressions.


Through compassionate conversations, we can challenge our views, learn to tolerate discomfort, and be glad when our eyes open and divisions dissolve. We begin to trust our perennial desire for connection and understanding, and are amazed by our innate instinct toward growth.


Ten Directions, founded by Diane and Rebecca Ejo Colwell, who are both informed by Integral Theory and Zen study and practice, is training facilitators and grounding them in meditation.


Healing and transformation don’t demand that we forget our history, not at all. But they do require that we change our relationship to pain and overcome our attachment to injury. People can often accomplish this on an individual basis, but in conversations between groups, the pressure of ethnocentrism is intense.


Some might say that to relinquish one’s attachment to identity is a capitulation. But from another perspective, tasting the freedom that is always available to us when we loosen our grip on identity is a spiritual gift that keeps us refreshed, revitalized, and present in this very moment.


But people who are self-realized, capable of regulating their nervous systems and managing their fears, can think clearly and act compassionately even under enormous pressure.


Awareness can be expanded, and attention can also be narrowed, like the lens of a camera, so that we can watch and witness the workings of our own individual sense perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and defensive patterns, as well as our beliefs, values, and intentions. Meditation practice is tremendously supportive when it comes to cultivating awareness. By sitting in meditation, we can gain a greater ability for self-observation, seeing the workings of our innermost reality more honestly and clearly. By sitting in meditation, we can learn to accommodate our experiences, whether positive or negative, and we can reduce our tendency to react and judge ourselves. Everything quiets down in the space of being fully present, where one’s essential being shines through. This is what Ken Wilber calls “waking up.”


Meditation practice is tremendously supportive when it comes to cultivating awareness. By sitting in meditation, we can gain a greater ability for self-observation, seeing the workings of our innermost reality more honestly and clearly.


There is an aphorism, “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.”3


We must listen, ask questions, express our thoughts and feelings clearly and directly, and pose challenges. In our work these are important interpersonal skills involved in good communication. The more we practice these skills, the more they become available to us when conversations become tense and emotionally charged. Old habits of reactivity are replaced by new habits of inquiry and open-mindedness. Developing our skills makes for better working relationships—and better relationships form the basis of clear, efficient activity.


For example, the business world, which typically focuses on goal setting, efficiency, action, and profit, is increasingly turning its attention toward the “soft” skills of interpersonal work.4


One Zen master says that our practice is our life.5 So our practice must always include other people.
