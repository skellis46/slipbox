#  Hindi - How Attention to Interoception Can Inform Dance/Movement Therapy

_previous note:_ [[interoception]]

Fatina Hindi is a dance movement therapist and this article summarises much of the neuroscience around interoception and how it is useful for DMT practitioners.

> By continuing to attend to, explore, and understand the nuanced process of interoception, DMT can better support clients’ development of resources for working through change and growth. Informed attention to interoception may support this resource-building in therapy. Supporting internalization of conscious engagement with interoception could help clients to build self-efficacy in observing, tracking, and relating to internal sensory stimuli. It is this writer’s recommendation that dance/movement therapists consider the neural-biological process of intero- ceptive processing to support treatment planning and application of therapeutic interventions.[@hindi-2012-how p.138]
