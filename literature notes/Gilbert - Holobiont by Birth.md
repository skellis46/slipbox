# Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth: Multilineage Individuals as the Concretion of Cooperative Processes

_previous note:_

>  As biologist Scott Gilbert tells us, “we have never been individuals.” His “we” refers to all life; his “individuals” are autonomous species as well as single organisms. If most of the cells in the human body are microbes, which “individual” are we? We can’t segregate our species nor claim distinctive status—as a body, a genome, or an immune system. And what if evolution selects for relations among species rather than “individuals”? [@tsing-2017-individuals p.M71] (Tsing et al. introducing Gilbert's chapter)

> In this chapter, I want to focus specifically on the holobiont, the organism plus its persistent microbial communities, and the ways that this concept disrupts the tenets of individualism that have structured dominant lines of thought not only within biology but also in fields as diverse as economics, politics, and philosophy. The holobiont is powerful, in part, because it is not limited to nonhuman organisms. It also changes what it means to be a person. [@gilbert-2017-holobiont p.M75]

>  We get our symbionts primarily by infection from the mother as we pass through the birth canal after the amnion breaks. These bacteria are supplemented by those from the mother’s skin and from the environment.12 [@gilbert-2017-holobiont p.M76]

> Because this chapter was first presented at a meeting where biologists, sociologists, and anthropologists were speaking to one another, let me mention some of the political ramifications of literally “becoming with the other.” In a social sense, symbionts play havoc with the notion of a pure body politic. We are definitely not monogenomic individuals. We do not share the same lineage. So what are symbionts? If one thinks of an animal organism in the classical sense of being an individual, then the symbionts are Gastarbeiter, guest workers who do the work that the stable members of the population won’t dirty themselves with. (One can think of such places as Saudi Arabia and Yemen, where certain lineages have citizenship and most of the population in the country are not citizens but rather temporary residents.) If one thinks of an animal as having porous borders, then the symbionts are legal resident aliens, like green card holders in the United States. Only if one thinks of the animal or any other organism as a holobiont are the symbionts full citizens of an evolving and heterogeneous (p.M83) community. The body and the body politic reflect each other’s awareness and anxieties.[@gilbert-2017-holobiont pp.M83-M84]
