#  Fischer - The problem of now

_previous note:_ [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]

John Martin Fischer is a philosopher of free will, moral responsibility and ethics. In this brief essay for [aeon](https://aeon.co) he provides a philosophical overview of the role of _now_ in meditation and in being human. He introduces the concept of the singularity thesis in which _now_ is the only time that exists: all we have is now. There is also the connection thesis that we should attend only to the now because of its singularity.

Fischer mounts two key arguments against the singularity and connection theses, one from the philosophy of language, the other from the philosophy of time. The linguistic argument describes _now_ -- like the word _here_ -- as indexical. That it is always true (Fischer says it is trivially so) but does not refer to the same time: "now it is Monday" is a different time from "now it is Tuesday" even though both are true.

In the philosophy of time Fischer outlines _presentism_ and _eternalism_ as the two main views:

> The presentist holds that only the present moment is real or exists, whereas the eternalist holds that every moment is equally real or extant. It’s clear that one cannot propound the singularity thesis (or the connection thesis) on the assumption of eternalism. After all, eternalism holds that all times are equally real.[@fischer-2021-problem n.pag.]

Where as the connection thesis requires presentism, presentism does not demand that we only pay attention to now. We are able to attend to things in the past, the future, and to characters and stories. 

Fischer describes two main types of meditation: meditation for serenity (Samatha) and meditation for insight (Vipassana). A third -- according to Fischer -- is meditation that cultivates attentiveness (as described by philospher and spiritual teacher George Gurdjieff):

> The idea here is to calm the mind and to free it from undue identification with particular thoughts and feelings. Thus the mind isn’t scattered or captured, but is free to fully take in the unfolding reality in front of one.[@fischer-2021-problem n.pag.]

This is distinguished by the desire to _be here now_, but rather than emphasizing _now_ it emphasizes _being_.

> The thrust of my argument can be construed as rejecting the surrender model and plumping for a ‘choice’ model. We have a choice about what we focus on, a choice not dictated by the unique present, if there is one. We are free to choose how we wish to be. We should indeed be here now, but not because the now is all we have.[@fischer-2021-problem n.pag.]
