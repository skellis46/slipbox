# From the Wood-Fired Oven Small by Richard Miscovich

> The random holes scattered throughout the loaf—called alveoli—were glossy, their iridescence a sign of starch gelating during the baking process. This open structure was something that had been lacking in my bread, and I learned that I could increase it by ensuring a vigorous, but controlled, fermentation and by increasing the hydration.

> It was a sense of providing food for my community. I was learning the most fundamental aspects of bread baking.

> I realized that bread is a social leveler. There is an attraction to bread that transcends age, gender, race, socioeconomic stratum, and any other category you can think of.

> Scandinavian ovens, necessarily efficient in a land where wood has long been scarce and precious.

> It is in our human spirit to build ovens, behold fire, bake bread, cook food, and provide for ourselves. Every one of us has a part in that story.

> The oven attributes Alan Scott promoted were high thermal mass, a low vault, and a sealed baking chamber to retain the steam—design components that aid the production of artisan bread.

> Retained heat, on the other hand, continues to dissipate. There are no other increases in heat levels until another fire is started. Bakers refer to this as a “falling oven.”
