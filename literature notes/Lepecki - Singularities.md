# Lepecki - Singularities

_previous note:_ [[literature notes/Paramana - The Contemporary Dance Economy]]

> It is a situation really hostile to, and impatient with, those who create the non-recognizable and don’t care about being recognized; those who cannot or would rather not participate in the generalized gregariousness of compulsive self(ie)-networking; those who do not fuel self(ie)-centered sociability. It is a situation with no space or time for those who insist on keep proposing, on keep gathering for no other purpose than to gather. Political theorists have called the conditions conditioning the situation and its newfound rationality, neoliberalism: “a specific and normative mode of reason, of the production of the subject, ‘conduct of conduct,’ and scheme of valuation (...) intensely governing subjects it claims to free from government” (Brown 2015: 48-49).[@lepecki-2016-singularities p.2]

- who ARE these people he is talking about? (!!)

> In this sense, dance and choreography, as knowledge formations on the conditions of mobility, self-mobility, and generalized mobilization, become critical to address [^SE1] and counter the kinetic impetus in neoliberalism.[@lepecki-2016-singularities p.5] 

 [^SE1]: I do find it hilarious how dance scholars seem to arrive at the same place: dance can save us. Dance is vital. It’s where Paramana starts.
 
> Strangely strange zones, depopulated from those who want to run things, populated by things that "want to run,” as Fred Moten and Stefano Harney say (Harney and Moten 2013: 51). A collective of singularities and events suddenly precipitating improbable encounters against a society of individuals and essences busily arranging ever more dates for ever more self(ie)-networking.[@lepecki-2016-singularities p.3]

"that (i)logic is governing conduct as if it were granting liberty"[@lepecki-2016-singularities p.3]

p.3: stealth revolution, body snatching

permeated subjectivity
