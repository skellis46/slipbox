# John Fechtel - All Traditions Are Oral Traditions

_previous note:_ 


<https://fechtel.substack.com/p/all-traditions-are-oral-traditions>

> None of us can help but evaluate information on the basis of a writer's authority as much as their veracity.

> The "dialogue" of knowledge production in the modern academy is less like a back-and-forth conversation between two interlocutors and more like a tangled skein, an ever-expanding net of concepts building on or contradicting each other. The discipline of citation creates linkages from one piece of research to another, enabling an interested reader to pull on an idea and draw out its origins back through the network of preceding ideas. Anyone setting out to write an academic paper will almost immediately realize how hard it is to write something out of whole cloth. With no presuppositions to bounce off of, no prior research to respond to, or no disciplinary concepts to extend, the writer is left with on a sheer face with no handholds. The necessity of dialogue is as present in highly literate or numerate cultures like the academy as it was in primary oral cultures.

> Despite all this, however, there are structural features of the modern bureaucracy of the academy that inveigh against truly open inquiry. The simplest is money: research takes funding, and funding takes backers. Some research funds come from institutions themselves, but most comes from outside sources. These outside sources can be federal or state governments, foundations and non-profits organizations, corporations, and even foreign governments or partnerships. And they are hardly ever general-purpose. A non-profit, for example, may give grants to conduct research in an area of special interest. A corporation may be seeking research and development help. A federal government may have an interest in accelerating research in a particular area that is conducive to the national interest, like infrastructure, defense, or manufacturing. These focuses are often benign, but they come with subtle pressures that cannot be fully overcome. If a non-profit is looking for evidence that its work is well-targeted, how likely is it to continue funding research that is yielding negative or null results? If a corporation cancels a grant a few years in because its claims are not being substantiated by the research, how likely are the researchers going to be to insult their funders the next time an opportunity arises?

> And the ideological or cognitive biases of both the researchers and the larger institutions around them can dramatically warp the research produced. One would think that training in literacy and numeracy would help researchers eliminate or mitigate their own cognitive biases. It is true that intensive education does reduce errors in reasoning arising from some common logical fallacies. But greater skills in what researchers call 'cognitive reflection' [actually seems to increase ideologically-motivated cognition](https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/cdfb0a53-5b34-4cd5-9346-fc296bf08d76?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc).

> The authors seem to recognize that institutional narrative control is cloaked by the trappings of objectivity, while covertly the selection, analysis, and summary of research done within that captured institution is deployed in service of a particular narrative. A critical-theoretic approach to research would make the covert overt, and assess the rigor of research by, among other things, its "emancipatory potential." The goal is emancipation, and the data will follow.
