# # Weiser - PhotoTherapy Techniques in Counselling and Therapy -- Using Ordinary Snapshots and Photo-Interaction

_previous note:_ [[embodied intelligence project]]

> All photos that people take and keep, whether for artistic purposes or simply their own ordinary snapshots and family photos, are much like "mirrors with memory"i, serving as markers of what (and who) has mattered most, and later talismans holding back the blurring that advancing years impose. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.23]

> Thus, from my initial conception of photography as "art" came experiences where photographs instead served as nonverbal catalysts to bring forth feelings and memories long buried from conscious awareness. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.24]

> The final technique, "Photo-Projectives" is based on the fact that the meaning of any photo is primarily created by its viewer during their process of viewing it (or taking or even just planning it), and thus any photograph that draws interest from client or therapist has potential use in the counselling setting. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.25]

> Holding a snapshot is not just holding a piece of paper; instead, it is a moment of time, being held, and it has been frozen forever. What is seen on this very thin piece of paper is perceived three-dimensionally, as if "alive" and existing "right now" (even if created long ago). The viewer is there within the space and time of that image, as if really physically there themselves. It's almost as if they were the camera itself, or at least were the photographer, capturing that moment in permanent memory. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.26]

- Does this hold for transparencies? (increased degree of abstraction??)

> For this reason, a photograph easily becomes a natural "transitional object", bridging realities without its viewer even realizing this is
happening. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.26]

> Someone once told me a photo was paper with "emotion" all over it; of course he meant "emulsion", but the malapropism stayed with me. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.27]

> And when such artifacts are later appropriated or re-worked for further re-use (such as in albums, gifts, screen-savers, forwarded jpegs, and so forth), their meaning will naturally become additionally embedded with even more layers deposited along that journey by all who came into contact with it -- and thus it will be even less able to ever be fully known in its "original" form. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.29]

- Noting here that the transparencies are re-purposing. Drawing the images out of the context for which they were originally taken.

> Memories and feelings do not communicate directly in words -- they flow whether or not they are being noticed or believed. When people pause to describe or explain them, this very act automatically alters what is being experienced or observed. This is the reason that the nonverbal sensory-based Therapies are the most appropriate approaches for working with the primarily visual metaphorical language of the unconscious, especially PhotoTherapy or Art Therapy (or, even better, both combined). [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.34]

> Because objective truth of any image is therefore an impossibility, no two viewers will ever get identical meaning from the same
photograph. This technique has been named "Photo-Projectives", because people always project meaning onto a photograph -- there is simply no other way to see one. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.44]

> Looking at a table on which many photos were laid out, one woman picked a photo of a person looking out of a train window, as being the one that most caught her attention emotionally. [@weiser-2004-phototherapy p.44]
