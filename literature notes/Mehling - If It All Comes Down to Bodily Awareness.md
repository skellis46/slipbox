#  Mehling - If It All Comes Down to Bodily Awareness, How Do We Know? Assessing Bodily Awareness

_previous note:_ [[definition of body awareness]]

This article is an "eclective narrative review"[@mehling-2020-if p.255] of methods for objectively recording or capturing (quantitatively and qualitatively) changes in the body as a consequence of body awareness activities (like somatic practices) that involve proprioceptive and interoceptive sensitivity.

- the writing is a goldmine of science literature investigating body awareness.
