#  Mehling - If It All Comes Down to Bodily Awareness, How Do We Know? Assessing Bodily Awareness

_previous note:_ [[definition of body awareness]]

This article is an "eclectic narrative review"[@mehling-2020-if p.255] of methods for objectively recording or capturing (quantitatively and qualitatively) changes in the body as a consequence of body awareness activities (like somatic practices) that involve proprioceptive and interoceptive sensitivity.

- the writing is a goldmine of science literature investigating body awareness.
- [[five stages of development of body awareness]]

> This paper aimed to show the many ways to study bodily awareness: from a first-person, qualitative phenomenological perspective; from second-person behavioral observation; quantitatively, by self-report with validated psychological questionnaires; and objectively, with psychophysiological and neuroscientific techniques.[@mehling-2020-if p.257]

- very curious about second-person behavioral observation: "a standardized semiqualitative observation scale (a method of second-person assessment)"[p.255]

> Science has opened up to rigorous studies of mindful-movement practices and body-awareness-enhancing approaches. This is the time.[@mehling-2020-if p.257]

Mehling writes that if we hypothesize that "that changes in bodily awareness are a key mechanism in mindful-movement practices, these measures can ideally be applied in research that uses [[mediation analysis]]."[@mehling-2020-if p.256] For example: ^f659e6

> In mindfulness-based classes for mothers preparing for childbirth, improvements in interoceptive awareness—again, assessed by the MAIA—mediated the beneficial effects on postpartum depression. And yoga for women improved women’s self-objectification mediated by an improved relationship to their bodies (Daubenmier, 2005).[@mehling-2020-if p.257]
