> In what follows, I’m using the term “AI” in a manner similar to how Kate Crawford uses it in *[Atlas of AI](https://substack.com/redirect/6131b471-0325-44ff-a1c5-cf0aa897534b?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* . Crawford observes that “artificial intelligence” is a term that “is both used and rejected in ways that keep its meaning in flux.” She notes, too, that “‘machine learning’ is more commonly used in the technical literature.” Consequently, she chooses to “use AI to talk about the massive industrial formation that includes politics, labor, culture, and capital” while using “machine learning” to refer to “a range of technical approaches.” Likewise, I am using AI here not to designate an array of specific technical practice and capabilities, but rather the present amorphous techno-cultural idea of AI as it is deployed, debated, feared, and celebrated. This idea of AI is not only as a massive industrial formation including politics, labor, culture, and capital, but also the consummation of a historical development which we ordinarily gloss as modernity.

> The late David Noble’s *[The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention](https://substack.com/redirect/af4d1b52-0eaa-419c-a37a-e6e49d463e2a?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* , first published in 1997, is a book that I turn to often. Noble was adamant about the sense in which readers should understand the phrase “religion of technology.” “Modern technology and modern faith are neither complements nor opposites,” Noble argued, “nor do they represent succeeding stages of human development. They are merged, and always have been, the technological enterprise being, at the same time, an essentially religious endeavor.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdfzmjkc42ezcy2fj7nc17p))


> “[Marvin] Minsky described the human brain as nothing more than a ‘meat machine’ and regarded the body, that ‘bloody mess of organic matter,’ as a ‘teleoperator for the brain.’ Both, he insisted, were eminently replaceable by machinery. What is important about life, Minsky argued, is ‘mind,’ which he defined in terms of ‘structure and subroutines’—that is, programming.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdg26cwyn63ca9xhhv4ea7m))

> “If intelligent machines were viewed as vehicles of human transcendence and immortality, they were also understood as having lives of their own and an ultimate destiny beyond human experience. In the eyes of AI visionaries, mind machines represented the next step in evolution, a new species, *Machina sapiens* , which would rival and ultimately supersede *Homo sapiens* as the most intelligent beings in creation. ‘I want to make a machine that will be proud of me,’ Danny Hillis proclaimed, acknowledging the superiority of his creation. ‘I guess I’m not overly perturbed by the prospects that there might be something better than us that might replace us … We’ve got a lot of bugs, sorts of bugs of left over history back from when we were animals. And I see no reason to believe that we’re the end of the chain and I think better than us is possible.’” [The most striking part of this was the phrase “from when we *were* animals.” The past tense is telling.] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdg696n7mkmpwywwv946812))

> **5.** The Enlightenment did not, as it turns out, vanquish Religion, driving it far from the pure realms of Science and Technology. In fact, to the degree that the radical Enlightenment’s assault on religious faith was successful, it empowered the religion of technology. To put this another way, the Enlightenment—and, yes, we are painting with broad strokes here—did not do away with the notions of Providence, Heaven, and Grace. Rather, the Enlightenment re-framed these as Progress, Utopia, and Technology respectively. If heaven had been understood as a transcendent goal achieved with the aid of divine grace within the context of the providentially ordered unfolding of human history, it became a Utopian vision, a heaven on earth, achieved by the ministrations Science and Technology within the context of Progress, an inexorable force driving history toward its Utopian consummation.

> It is Christian insofar as its aspirations that are like those nurtured by the Christian faith, such as the conscious persistence of a soul after the death of the body. Noble cites Daniel Crevier, who referencing the “Judeo-Christian tradition” suggested that “religious beliefs, and particularly the belief in survival after death, are not incompatible with the idea that the mind emerges from physical phenomena.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdga535n3rxkx6rcrp0axjs))


> This is noted on the way to explaining that a machine-based material support could be found for the mind, which leads Noble to quip. “Christ was resurrected in a new body; why not a machine?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdgajp4tamr50248c68bhvx))


> In other words, we might frame the religion of technology not so much as a Christian heresy, but rather as (post-)Christian fan-fiction, an elaborate imagining of how the hopes articulated by the Christian faith will materialize as a consequence of human ingenuity in the absence of divine action. ³ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdgf9arw125xrzc8qm5ejq3))


> Below is part of an exchange between the (under-appreciated) philosopher Hans Jonas and Arendt:
>  > **Jonas** : I share with Hannah Arendt the position that we are not in possession of any ultimates, either by knowledge or by conviction or faith […]

>  > However, a part of wisdom is knowledge of ignorance. The Socratic attitude is to know that one does not know. And this realization of our ignorance can be of great practical importance in the exercise of the power of judgment, which is after all related to action in the political sphere, into future action, and far-reaching action.

> Our enterprises have an eschatological tendency in them—a built in utopianism, namely, to move towards ultimate situation. Lacking the knowledge of ultimate values—or, of what is ultimately desirable—or, of what is man so that the world can be fitting for man, we should at least abstain from allowing eschatological situations to come about. This alone is a very important practical injunction that we can draw from the insight that only with some conception of ultimates are we entitled to embark on certain things. So that at least as a restraining force the point of view I brought in may be of some relevance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdgj8787r8jejp152v0czvw))


> “What I am against—and without a minute’s hesitation or apology—is our slovenly willingness to allow machines and the idea of the machine to prescribe the terms and conditions of the lives of creatures, which we have allowed increasingly for the last two centuries, and are still allowing, at an incalculable cost to other creatures *and* *to ourselves* . If we state the problem that way, then we can see that the way to correct our error, and so deliver ourselves from our own destructiveness, is to quit using our technological capability as the reference point and standard of our economic life. We will instead have to measure our economy by the health of the ecosystems and human communities where we do our work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdgkebgq1326v3crbdxh5xt))

> AI can thus be read as a last ditch effort to shore up the old decrepit structures and to double down on the promise of scale, efficiency, rationality, control, and prediction. It can also be read as an effort to extend the logic of late modernity to a point of absurdity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gxdgpq3ndsv2xmbp3wwsepgt))
