# Lawson and Salami - The other side of the mountain

_previous note:_[[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]]

- an image as something to hang an idea from, p.151
- mountain with two views as image or metaphor for 'knowledge': "what knowledge looks like from the other side of the mountain"; need to see the entire mountain to know something p.153

> What the other side of the mountain shows, in my view, is that knowledge and truth are much messier than that, much more complex, and we can't actually measure, categorise, create taxonomies of every single thing, especially not of our inner worlds.[Salami, in @lawson-2022-other p.153]

- look into writing of Chimamanda Nzozi Adichie, p.154
- not romanticising indigenous knowledge: engage with it critically, p.157
- Toni Morrison, doing beauty, "to go out there and do beauty", pp.158-159
