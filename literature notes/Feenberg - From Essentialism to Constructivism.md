# Feenberg - From Essentialism to Constructivism

> For these thinkers modernity continues to be characterized by a unique form of technical action and thought that threatens nontechnical values as it extends itself ever deeper into social life. They argue that technology is not neutral.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism pp.294-295] 


According to Heidegger, "Instead of a world of authentic things capable ofgathering a rich variety ofcontexts and meanings, we are left with an "objectless" heap offunctions."[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.296]

> Translated out of Heidegger's ontological language, this seems to mean that technology is a cultural form through which everything in the modern world becomes available for control. This form leaves nothing untouched ... variety of contexts and meanings, we are left with an "objectless" heap of functions."[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.296]


> Heidegger calls for resignation and passivity rather than an active program of reform that, in his view would simply constitute a further extension of modern technology. As Heidegger explained in his last interview, "Only a god can save us" from the juggernaut of progress (Heidegger 1977b).[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.296]

> Although Heidegger means his critique to cut deeper than any social or historical fact about our times, it is by no means irrelevant to a modern world armed with nuclear weapons and controlled by vast technology- based organizations. These latter in particular illustrate the basic concepts of the critique with striking clarity. Alain Gras explores the inexorable growth of such macrosystems as the electric power and airline industries (Gras 1993). As they apply ever more powerful technologies, gain control over more and more of their environment, and plan ever further into the future, they effectively escape human control and indeed human purpose. Macrosystems take on what Thomas Hughes calls momentum, a quasi- deterministic power to perpetuate themselves and to force other institutions to conform to their requirements (Hughes 1989).
> Heidegger's basic claim that we are caught in the grip of our own techniques is thus all too believable. Increasingly, we lose sight of what is sacrificed in the mobilization of human beings and resources for goals that remain ultimately obscure.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.296]

Note here that Feenberg is not yet talking about social media, and in particular Zuboff's data mining.

> Unfortunately, Heidegger's argument is developed at such a high level of abstraction he literally cannot discriminate between electricity and atom bombs, agricultural techniques and the Holocaust.3 All are merely different expressions of the identical enframing, which we are called to transcend through the recovery of a deeper relation to being. And since he rejects technical regression while leaving no room for a better technological future, it is difficult to see in what that relation would consist beyond a mere change of attitude. Surely these ambiguities indicate problems in his approach.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.297]

> Borgmann's social critique is based on the concept of the "device paradigm" as the formative principle of a technological society that aims above all at efficiency. In conformity with this paradigm, modern technology separates off the good or commodity it delivers from the contexts and means of delivery. Thus the heat of the modern furnace appears miraculously from discreet sources in contrast with the old wood stove that stands in the center of the room and is supplied by regular trips to the woodpile. The microwaved meal emerges effortlessly and instantly from its plastic wrapping at the individual's command in contrast with the laborious operations of a traditional kitchen serving the needs of a whole family.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.298]

This is the aspect of [[device paradigm and focal things]] that is about what is hidden. It's very hard to argue in [[Lithium dancing]] that this is not happening with the software. 

> Focal things require a certain effort, it is true, but without that effort, the rewards of a meaningful life are lost in the vapid disengagement of the operator of a smoothly functioning machinery (Borgmann 1984, 204 ff.).[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.299]

> Borgmann's contrast between the decontextualization of the device and the essentially contextual focal thing reprises Heidegger's distinction between modern technological enframing and the "gathering" power of traditional craft production that draws people and nature together around a materialized site of encounter. Borgmann's solution, bounding the technical sphere to restore the centrality of meaning, is reminiscent of Habermas's strategy (although apparently not due to his influence). It offers a more understandable response to invasive technology than anything in Heidegger.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.299]

> However, Borgmann's approach suffers from both the ambiguity of Heidegger's original theory and the limitations of Habermas's. We cannot tell for sure if he is merely denouncing the modern attitude toward technology or technological design, and in the latter case, his critique is so broad it offers no criteria for the constructive reform of technology itself.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.299]

> Why not just reify the concept of technology and treat it as a singular essence? The problem with that is the existence of smaller but still significant differences that may become more important in the future rather than less so as essentialists assume. What is more, those differences often concern precisely the issues identified by Borgmann as central to a humane life. They determine the nature of community, education, medical care, work, our relation to the natural environment, the functions of devices such as computers and automobiles, in ways either favorable or unfavorable to the preservation of meaning and focal things.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.300]

- need for precision. Not to treat it as this 'essential' thing. Nuance. 

In critiquing Borgmann, Feenberg describes the following:

> No longer are the individuals "commanding presences" for each other; they have become disposable experiences that can be turned on and off like water from a faucet. The person as a focal thing has become a commodity delivered by a device. This new way of relating has weakened connection and involvement while extending its range.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.300]

> We will see that the real struggle is not between the computer and low-tech alternatives, but within the realm of possibilities opened by the computer itself.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.301]

> The ambiguities of the computer are far from unique. In fact they are typical of most technologies, especially in the early phases of their development. Recognizing this malleability of technology, we can no longer rest content with globally negative theories that offer only condemnation of the present and no guidance for the future.[@feenberg-2000-essentialism p.304]
