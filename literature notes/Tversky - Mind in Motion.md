## part 1.

### chapter 1: The Space of the Body: Space Is for Action

#### mirror neurons

> Mirror neurons underlie the understanding part of imitation, but not the doing part. Naturally, these findings, now replicated many times, have generated enormous excitement. Overinterpretation of tantalizing findings like these is inevitable. Might mirror neurons underlie imitation, learning, and memory? The research group in Parma has gone to great effort to explain that seeing is not imitating and that understanding is not doing. If it were that simple, we’d all be expert pianists or basketball players or acrobats. Motor resonance, however, is real: that is, seeing action causes associated motor regions of the brain and even associated muscles to activate.

#### motor resonance

> Our experience performing specific actions modulates our perception of the same actions performed by others. In an experiment that has generated smiles, excitement, and even some controversy, experts in capoeira, experts in ballet, and nonexperts viewed videos of standard movements in capoeira and ballet while in a scanner that measured their brain activity. Brain activity in a network involved in the mirror system (premotor cortex, intraparietal sulcus, right superior parietal lobe, and left posterior superior temporal sulcus) showed more activation when observers watched the movements for which they were experts.
> The broader implication is by now a familiar one: we understand actions that we view by simulating the actions in our bodies, by embodying the perception. Many names for more or less the same phenomenon: motor simulation, motor resonance, embodiment. There are even more.

- this is a very precise understanding of embodiment (in field of psychology) in which we come to understand actions by drawing perceptions into the body and then simulating them. This seems quite distinct from [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]] (but I'm not so sure) 

> Along with other evidence and more to come, it suggests that we map body action that we see onto our own body’s action system. Perception of action acquires meaning through motor understanding. Experts with more articulated motion systems perceive more meaning in what they see.
