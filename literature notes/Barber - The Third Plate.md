# Dan Barber - The Third Plate Field Notes on the Future of Food

_previous note:_ [[Pollan - In Defence of Food]]

> Though most of the food we eat still comes from agriculture that’s mired in this mind-set—extract more, waste more—the pulse of common sense suggests this won’t last. It will, in the words of the environmental writer Aldo Leopold, “die of its own too-much.”
Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma and Wendell Berry’s The Unsettling of America are on our cookbook shelves, as much for reference as for inspiration.

> In Berry’s words, we understand that eating “is inescapably an agricultural act, and that how we eat determines, to a considerable extent, how the world is used.”

> Farm-to-table may sound right—it’s direct and connected—but really the farmer ends up servicing the table, not the other way around. It makes good agriculture difficult to sustain.

> Colonial agriculture took root in the philosophy of extraction. Conquer and tame nature rather than work in concert with nature. The exploitative relationship was made possible by the availability of large quantities of enormously productive land.

> I was looking toward a new cuisine, one that goes beyond raising awareness about the provenance of ingredients and—like all great cuisines—begins to reflect what the landscape can provide.

> To grow nature is to encourage more of it. That’s not easy to do. More nature means less control. Less control requires a certain kind of faith, which is where the worldview comes into play. Do you see the natural world as needing modification and improvement, or do you see it as something to be observed and interpreted? Do you view humans as a small part of an unbelievably complicated and fragile system, or do you view us as the commanders? The farmers in this book are observers. They listen. They don’t exert control.

> Monocultures do that. They impoverish life and all its fantastic little ecosystems. They depopulate landscapes.

> I was learning what John Muir, the American environmentalist, observed a century ago: “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.” Or rather, I was relearning what I’d discovered with that summer of corn, which supplanted the natural contours of the farm, stripped away the community of farmers, tractors, and hay bales—what Wendell Berry called the “culture” in agriculture—and left me without much of a summer.

> But interactions and relationships—what Muir called hitching, and we call ecology—cannot be measured or weighed. I found, for example, that the health of an aquaculture farm in southern Spain is connected to how we treat our soil, and that how we treat our soil determines, to a considerable extent, how we grow our grain, especially wheat, which is impossible to separate from how we choose our bread.

> He said one day he got up the nerve to ask a Mennonite bishop why rubber tires were forbidden. The bishop answered Klaas’s question with a question: “When do you start raising a child?” According to the bishop, Klaas told us, child rearing begins not at birth, or even conception, but one hundred years before a child is born, “because that’s when you start building the environment they’re going to live in.” Mennonites, he went on, believe that if you look at the history of tractors with rubber tires, you see failure within a generation. Rubber tires enable easy movement, and easy movement means that, inevitably, the farm will grow, which means more profit. More profit, in turn, leads to the acquisition of even more land, which usually means less crop diversity, more large machinery, and so on. Pretty soon the farmer becomes less intimate with his farm. It’s that lack of intimacy that leads to ignorance, and eventually to loss.

> I asked Klaas why he found it important to grow wheat. He paused to examine another stalk. “The nice thing about wheat is how it’s tied to Western civilization, to the cradle of civilization. The history of wheat is the history of a sociable crop.”

> In his book Seeds, Sex & Civilization, Peter Thompson says all three of the world’s great grains—wheat, corn, and rice—provided the foundations for civilization. But, he wrote, “whereas the foundations provided by maize and rice were sufficient to build walls,” wheat’s inherently communal qualities “provided the keystones of arches to support the edifices of urban civilizations.”

> Klaas acknowledged the disconnect. “I see people go to all the trouble to visit the farmers’ market and really take the time to pick out the best peach, or stand in line for a grass-fed steak that’s treated the way a cow ought to be treated,” he said. “And then on their way home they buy packaged bread in the store.” He removed his cap and ran his hand over a mop of matted-down hair. “That’s bread made with wheat that’s adulterated and dead, even more than the fruits and vegetables they successfully avoided purchasing a half hour before. And I mean dead, like a rotten tomato, which you would never eat.” He turned to me. “So how is this possible? How do we get to the point that we willingly, even happily, eat the equivalent of a rotten tomato?” He paused, looking out at his fields as a gentle breeze made the wheat sway in unison. “It happens,” he said, “because we’ve lost the taste of grain.”

> Who’s responsible for killing wheat? It’s no mystery—what makes the story of American wheat so interesting, and so tragic, is just how obvious it all was. Culinary historian Karen Hess once called it “the conjugation of seemingly unrelated events.” Everyone and no one killed wheat. It was the perfect murder.

> The whiter flour became, the greater the demand. To be fair, that’s been the history of wheat for thousands of years. But for all its efficiency, steel couldn’t match the old-school grindstone in two key respects. In fully removing the germ—that vital, living element of wheat—and the bran, the roller mill not only killed wheat but also sacrificed nearly all of its nutrition. While the bran and the germ represent less than 20 percent of a wheat kernel’s total weight, together they comprise 80 percent of its fiber and other nutrients.

> Stone-milled flour retained a golden hue from the crushed germ’s oil and was fragrant with bits of nutty bran. The roller mills might have finally achieved a truly white flour, but the dead, chalky powder no longer tasted of wheat—or really of anything at all. We didn’t just kill wheat. We killed the flavor.

> In his essay “The Native Grasses and What They Mean,” Wendell Berry writes, “As we felled and burned the forests, so we burned, plowed, and overgrazed the prairies. We came with visions, but not with sight. We did not see or understand where we were or what was there, but destroyed what was there for the sake of what we desired.”

> However unwittingly, chefs and bakers have played a part in that decline. Profiting from mountains of cheap flour, we’ve bought into the system. We’re complicit in the depopulation of the prairie, just as we have blood on our hands for the death of wheat.

> He said, ‘See what you’re looking at.’ I love that quote. Think about that. It requires close observation without prejudice. How often do we see something without really seeing?”

> All this had been missing from the previous farmer’s chemical regime. Synthetic fertilizers supplied the corn with nitrogen for fast growth, but the soil itself was ignored, never paid back for the harvests. According to Klaas, it was “like burning your house to keep it warm each year.”

> The fact that a farmer can make more money feeding animals than feeding people is a problem with the marketplace, Klaas said, reiterating a point he had made to me many times before.

> But then the question was, what kind of wheat? Modern wheats are hard on the soil—extractive rather than restorative, like spelt—and Klaas is judicious about planting them. “I obviously get more money from the newer varieties, but, again, I pay for it,” he said. “The full accounting includes what’s drawn from the soil bank.” Klaas chose emmer, an ancient wheat once grown throughout the American Northeast. Emmer is known for its large root systems, providing optimum yields without large fertility requirements.

> The more I learned from Klaas, the more I saw the error in that way of thinking. These kinds of questions matter quite a bit more to chefs, because how soil is managed, and how a farmer negotiates weeds and pests, is the single best predictor of how food will taste.

> What happens when farming is introduced? We upset the balance. By harvesting crops, we extract and export (and eventually eat) soil fertility, which requires that an equal or greater amount be returned to the soil. Sir Albert Howard, the British scientist and father of organic agriculture, called this the Law of Return, the word law suggesting—rightly, it turns out—that it’s nonnegotiable. Unless fertility is restored, soils suffer. Restoring fertility is the key to soil health, which means it’s key for flavor, as well.

> Disenchanted with the narrowness of university research (he found the work of “learning more and more about less and less” stifling), Howard decided to put his learning into practice. At the age of thirty-two, he was sent to India as a development worker to teach Indian peasants some of the modern ways of growing food. He remained for twenty-five years and ultimately determined that it was the Indian peasants who had taught him.

> When insecticides and fungicides are used, they usurp the plant’s natural defenses, which means the plant produces fewer phytonutrients. Studies show that organic fruits and vegetables typically contain between 10 and 50 percent more antioxidants and other defense-related compounds than are found in conventional produce.

> Industrially produced grains, vegetables, and fruits taste of almost nothing because the nitrates have crowded out the minerals.

> “In a healthy system,” Jack said, waving his hand to indicate all the vegetation above us, “everything you’re looking at has a corresponding weight of roots and organisms belowground. Everything.”

> Researchers now refer to large-scale “biomass dilution”—plants that have such low concentrations of certain nutrients that they do not adequately nourish the people who eat them.

> Joan is a longtime analyst and critic of the industrial food system and the woman who famously said, “I prefer butter to margarine because I trust cows more than chemists.”

> Eduardo’s methods may sound extravagant, but many studies have shown the connection between suffering and degraded meat. If an animal is stressed—during its life, and especially in those last moments before death—it manifests, just as Eduardo claimed, in the flavor and texture of the final product.

> Wendell Berry once described the land as an “immeasurable gift,” and he wasn’t just referring to food. In the rush to industrialize farming, we’ve lost the understanding, implicit since the beginning of agriculture, that food is a process, a web of relationships, not an individual ingredient or commodity. What Berry refers to as the culture in agriculture is as integral to the process as the soil or the sun. Here in the dehesa, culture and agriculture seemed not only intertwined but interchangeable.

> Aldo Leopold, reflecting on America in the mid-1900s, believed that our culture had it mostly wrong. His anthology A Sand County Almanac, published shortly after his death in 1949 and considered by many scholars to be the bible of American environmentalism, includes his now famous essay “The Land Ethic,” in which he argued that our idea of a community, prefaced on the interaction between human beings, was simply too limited. A broader definition of a sustainable community was needed to include soil, water, plants, and animals—“or collectively: the land.” In other words, he defined community the way the Spanish use the word tierra, viewing each component of the system the way Klaas viewed his wild plants—as so critical to the other parts, they fit together like a living pyramid: The bottom layer is the soil, an insect layer on the plants, a bird and rodent layer on the insects, and so on up through various animal groups to the apex layer, which consists of the larger carnivores. . . . Each successive layer depends on those below it for food and often for other services, and each in turn furnishes food and services to those above.

> “That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that land is to be loved and respected is an extension of ethics,” he wrote. Leopold saw it as our responsibility, as members of the community, to protect nature’s greatest gift: its capacity for self-renewal. “A land ethic, then, reflects the existence of an ecological conscience, and this in turn reflects a conviction of individual responsibility for the health of the land.”

> Today, farmers routinely plant new oaks to replenish natural loss. It’s not done for personal gain—in their own lifetimes those trees will never produce an acorn. The practice is largely based on what their parents and grandparents did before them, a tradition in line with the Mennonite belief that you start raising a child one hundred years before he is born.

> Looking out over the land, I realized that in front of me was an answer to a question at the core of Aldo Leopold’s land ethic: how do we keep in check our incentive to abuse the land for maximum economic return, and transition from a “conqueror of the land-community” to a “plain member and citizen of it”?

> I’ve since learned from Klaas that this bicycle lane of semiwilderness, where both ecosystems interact and flourish, is recognized in ecology as an ecotone.

> Safina ends Song for the Blue Ocean with a thought that I also underlined: “The promise: that any honest inquiry into the reality of nature also yields insights about ourselves and the dramatic context of the human spirit.”

> The second part is, to borrow a phrase from Steiner, spiritual, and that takes more time to decipher. Steiner was one of the earliest writers to question the so-called mechanistic approach to science, which viewed the workings of the environment in separate parts—machinelike more than lifelike.

> According to Fred Kirschenmann, a sustainable-agriculture writer, theologian, and the president of Stone Barns Center’s board, these ideas took root during the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, led by people like Sir Francis Bacon, who believed you could bend nature to your will, and René Descartes, who saw humans as masters and possessors of nature.

> By the third or fourth slice, I’d gained an entirely new appreciation for the term “whole wheat.” The technical definition is that the entire wheat kernel is preserved in the flour. What’s missing from this definition is the feeling of satiation that whole grain provides. Classic brioche is rich, even decadent, but it doesn’t do much more than fulfill a craving. It’s a pleasure, not a satisfaction.

> The bread had the same nuttiness we had tasted in the first batch, but with a new honeyed spice flavor that was uniquely its own. And it seemed just a little lighter, with more cavities in the crumb, or interior, of the bread. Holding a piece up close, I thought back to the subterranean reaches of Jack’s vegetable field, with its miles of routes for microorganisms to maneuver. Back then, Jack had explained how the organisms’ ceaseless activity provided the plant with everything it needed to produce delicious flavors. I bit into another slice of the brioche and tasted exactly what he meant.

> Refined white flour satisfies those same urges by delivering a hearty shot of glucose more efficiently than whole grains. With no fibrous bran, there is nothing to slow the conversion of starches to sugars. A nutritionist I know once compared refined white flour to crack cocaine—a pure, immediate hit that only makes you crave more.

> The new philosophy was codified in the best-selling Tassajara Bread Book. Part gentle manifesto (the book is illustrated with drawings of laughing Buddhas and cats), part cookbook, it perfectly captured the longing for a wholesome alternative to industrial food and farming.

> But I’ve come to understand that even soil doesn’t dial back far enough. Its microorganisms can be thriving, and you can still end up with flavorless wheat—because modern wheat (unlike Klaas’s heirloom varieties) is not bred for flavor. It’s bred for monocultures and high yield, and for industrial milling and baking. We’ve lost the taste of wheat, in part, because we’ve stopped breeding it for flavor.

> and his recent interest in John Letts (a British archaeobotanist who documents the history of cereals).

> In some ways, wheat was an exception. Bread wheat is a hexaploid, which means it has six sets of chromosomes (and therefore six copies of each gene), whereas corn and most vegetables—and even human beings—possess only two. So it doesn’t open itself up to easy manipulation. It is also self-pollinating, each wheat plant containing both male and female parts. Since the plants fertilize themselves, crosses between different varieties are less likely to occur, either naturally or through deliberate intervention.

> As Cary Fowler and Patrick Mooney note in their book Shattering: Food, Politics, and the Loss of Genetic Diversity, the relationship between dwarf seeds and chemical fertilizers is “akin to the relationship of the chicken and the egg. The fertilizers made the new varieties possible. The new varieties made the fertilizers necessary.”

> As long as we don’t eat the diversity, the pull to produce more of the primary crop is too strong.

> Cuisines did not develop from what the land offered, as is often said; they developed from what the land demanded. The Green Revolution turned this equation on its head by making diversity expensive. It empowered only a few crops. And in the process, it dumbed down cuisine.

> Location used to be everything; now it’s just another ingredient.

> As the great gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin said, “Tell me what you eat: I will tell you what you are.”

> Glenn is interested in the primal act of tasting—eating food directly from the plant, with little processing—but he’s also searching for what he calls the “sub-taste threshold.” I asked what that meant. “Below the palate sensitivity range. It’s visceral, which good chefs can pick up on. It’s a McGee thing.” (Harold McGee: writer and food scientist.)

> “So now it’s time to mill the wheat. We mill it to order. You call up your graham flour order, and the next day we mill and send it to you overnight. I’m looking at flour like you would a carton of milk or a bag of peaches. Because it’s a fresh product. It’s alive.”

> “Everyone else pursues shelf life. Most flour preservation is done by toasting it slightly—it’s called kilning—and what you’re doing is drying out the grain further so there’s absolutely no moisture. That’s what we eat. Wheat picked long past ripeness, then broken apart, and then mummified. Mills are abattoirs for wheat.”

> It’s that modern agriculture has thoroughly separated the agri from the culture. They’ve killed the meaning of the word—bifurcated it, completely, in just the last thirty or so years.

> Food and cuisine have to be an important part of our culture, and not just something that fuels the culture in one way. Food as fuel is a dangerous concept.

> He stopped before we got to the car to underscore his point. “I’ve learned above all else that if what I’m doing is going to work, the culture of food is as important, if not more important, than the production of food.”

> That’s how I found myself e-mailing Steve Jones, a breeder for Washington State University whose name I’d heard tossed around by several people, including Glenn. Steve was renowned in the field for his interest in small-scale wheat breeding and his commitment to flavor. I introduced myself and told him I was interested in learning more about his work. His response came the same afternoon.

> It was a point I’d never considered: when chefs advocate for older varieties, the assumption is that we’re advocating for the farmer, too. But Steve was saying Not so. Unless the farmer takes the time to adapt the variety to his own environment, there’s often a substantial risk in the form of low yields or poor disease resistance.

> “With wheat, yield and flavor are not in inverse proportion. There’s plenty of room for flavor.” The trade-off between yield and flavor, he explained, happens mainly in crops that, in their domesticated form, contain a lot of water. “A true wild tomato is smaller than a cherry,” he said, offering a pinch of his index finger. Wild foods tend to be more flavorful because they’re not “washed out by water.”

> “You don’t eat wheat by the acre; you eat it by the slice, and you’d have to eat a whole loaf of bread made from modern varieties of wheat to get the equivalent nutrition in just half a loaf made from the older varieties,” Steve said.

> asked Glenn what he thought about wheat that had been crossbred in a laboratory, rather than in a landrace system like his. “How do I feel about it? I feel great about it. I’d say any way we can bring back nutrition and flavor back into wheat—which is the same damn thing, as every chef knows—any way we can do it, by landraces like I do or by inventing new varieties in a laboratory, like the ones you’re looking at, I’m all for it. Because wheat is fundamental. It’s everywhere in our culture. And if it’s not correct, the culture starts crashing down.”

> The problem, he said, is that these farmers are often, like Klaas, planting very old varieties with low yield—the problem with heirloom anything—or they’re planting conventional varieties with no flavor. “Without a breeder to support the continual betterment of the plant, an alternative to conventional wheat will never establish itself.”

> “Look, as a baker, I loved those days back when we never really knew what would come out of the oven,” Nancy told me. “I mean, that is what bread baking was all about for me. But while people understand the change in seasons when it comes to the availability of fruits and vegetables, or the different cheeses at different times of the year, they see bread as more than a staple. People view bread as stability itself. You really can’t mess with that.”

> Instead of asking the university to fund a laboratory filled with scientists analyzing traits and genes, Steve used the money to build a new kind of laboratory, unlike anything that exists in this country, if not the world—a public research space that brings together farmers, chefs, bakers, and breeders to freely experiment with new wheat varieties. He calls it the Bread Lab.

> Steve pointed to still another machine, this one called the NIR, which measures for protein content. Like the alveograph and the falling-number machine, the NIR looked awkwardly out of place, its design perhaps inspired by a low-budget 1960s sci-fi film. “It’s measuring light absorption,” Steve explained. “The higher the absorption, the more protein present in the wheat.”

> “To get these whopping percentages, you have to fertilize your soil. There’s a direct correlation between healthy soil and good protein content, but farmers are forced to do it artificially to get these numbers every time. Every time,” Steve said. “Nature doesn’t work like that.”

> Even with the farm-to-table movement running high at the moment, we’re still guilty of reducing sustainability down to what we buy for dinner. Rarely do we imagine the whole picture, which means that rarely are we forced to realize that a truly sustainable food system is not simple. It is not built on one or two principles of farming, and it does not produce merely one or two good things to eat.

> Did I know that cows with names produce more milk than cows without names?
