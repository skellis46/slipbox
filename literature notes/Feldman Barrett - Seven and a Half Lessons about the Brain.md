## Highlights

> You can think about energy efficiency like a budget. A financial budget tracks money as it’s earned and spent. A budget for your body similarly tracks resources like water, salt, and glucose as you gain and lose them. Each action that spends resources, such as swimming or running, is like a withdrawal from your account. Actions that replenish your resources, such as eating and sleeping, are like deposits. This is a simplified explanation, but it captures the key idea that running a body requires biological resources. Every action you take (or don’t take) is an economic choice​—​your brain is guessing when to spend resources and when to save them. (Location 94)


> allostasis. (Location 108)


> The scientific name for body budgeting is allostasis. It means automatically predicting and preparing to meet the body’s needs before they arise. (Location 109)


> Your brain’s most important job is to control your body​—​to manage allostasis​—by predicting energy needs before they arise so you can efficiently make worthwhile movements and survive. (Location 137)


> Of course, your brain does think and feel and imagine and create hundreds of other experiences, such as letting you read and understand this book. But all of these mental capacities are consequences of a central mission to keep you alive and well by managing your body budget. Everything your brain creates, from memories to hallucinations, from ecstasy to shame, is part of this mission. (Location 141)


> According to this evolutionary story, the human brain ended up with three layers​—​one for surviving, one for feeling, and one for thinking​—​an arrangement known as the triune brain. The deepest layer, or lizard brain, which we allegedly inherited from ancient reptiles, is said to house our survival instincts. The middle layer, dubbed the limbic system, supposedly contains ancient parts for emotion that we inherited from prehistoric mammals. The outermost layer, part of the cerebral cortex, is said to be uniquely human and the source of rational thought; it’s known as the neocortex (“new cortex”). (Location 169)


> All mammals have a relatively big cortex in a brain that’s relatively large for their body size. Our cortex is just a scaled-up version of the relatively smaller cortex found in relatively smaller-brained monkeys, chimps, and many carnivores. It’s also a scaled-down version of the larger cortex found in the larger brains of elephants and whales. If a monkey’s brain could grow to human size, its cerebral cortex would be the same size as ours. (Location 253)


> The size of our cerebral cortex, therefore, is not evolutionarily novel and does not require any special explanation. (Location 257)


> Anything you read or hear that proclaims the human neocortex, cerebral cortex, or prefrontal cortex to be the root of rationality, or says that the frontal lobe regulates so-called emotional brain areas to keep irrational behavior in check, is simply outdated or woefully incomplete. The triune brain idea and its epic battle between emotion, instinct, and rationality is a modern myth. (Location 264)


> Natural selection did not aim itself toward us​—​we’re just an interesting sort of animal with particular adaptations that helped us survive and reproduce in particular environments. Other animals are not inferior to humans. They are uniquely and effectively adapted to their environments. Your brain is not more evolved than a rat or lizard brain, just differently evolved. (Location 272)


> Perhaps rationality is better defined in terms of the brain’s most important job: body budgeting​—​managing all the water, salt, glucose, and other bodily resources we use every day. In this view, rationality means spending or saving resources to succeed in your immediate environment. (Location 286)


> What we call mental illnesses, then, may be rational body-budgeting for the short term that’s out of sync with the immediate environment, the needs of other people, or your own best interests down the road. (Location 300)


> Even a simple reaching action like this, when done more than once, can be guided by different sets of neurons. This phenomenon is called degeneracy. (Location 400)


> Brains of higher complexity can remember more. A brain doesn’t store memories like files in a computer​—​it reconstructs them on demand with electricity and swirling chemicals. We call this process remembering but it’s really assembling. (Location 443)


> After months of practice sharing attention with caregivers, an infant will learn to elicit shared attention from them. He will look at them as a way of asking whether something is in his niche and what it might mean for his body budget. In this manner, the infant learns to focus attention even more effectively on things that matter. (Location 560)


> This arrangement helps our cultural and social knowledge flow efficiently from generation to generation. Each little brain becomes optimized for its particular environment, the one it developed in. Caregivers curate a baby’s physical and social niche, and the baby’s brain learns that niche. When the baby grows up, he perpetuates that niche by passing his culture to the next generation through his words and actions, wiring their brains in turn. This process, called cultural inheritance, is efficient and frugal because evolution doesn’t have to encode all our wiring instructions in genes. It off-loads much of the job to the world around us, including the other humans in that world. We unknowingly wire the knowledge of our culture into our offspring after birth, for better or worse.

> How does your brain decipher the sense data so it knows how to proceed? If it used only the ambiguous information that is immediately present, then you’d be swimming in a sea of uncertainty, flailing around until you figured out the best response. Luckily, your brain has an additional source of information at its disposal: memory. Your brain can draw on your lifetime of past experiences​—​things that have happened to you personally and things that you’ve learned about from friends, teachers, books, videos, and other sources. In the blink of an eye, your brain reconstructs bits and pieces of past experience as your neurons pass electrochemical information back and forth in an ever-shifting, complex network. Your brain assembles these bits into memories to infer the meaning of the sense data and guess what to do about it. (Location 674)


> Your past experiences include not only what happened in the world around you but also what happened inside your body. Was your heart beating quickly? Were you breathing heavily? Your brain asks itself in every moment, figuratively speaking, The last time I encountered a similar situation, when my body was in a similar state, what did I do next? The answer need not be a perfect match for your situation, just something close enough to give your brain an appropriate plan of action that helps you survive and even thrive. (Location 680)


> This explains how the brain plans your body’s next action. How does your brain also conjure high-fidelity experiences, like guerrilla fighters in the forest, out of scraps of raw data from the outside world? How does it create feelings of terror from a thundering heart? Once again, your brain recreates the past from memory by asking itself, The last time I encountered a similar situation, when my body was in a similar state and was preparing this particular action, what did I see next? What did I feel next? The answer becomes your experience. In other words, your brain combines information from outside and inside your head to produce everything you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. (Location 683)


> Artwork, particularly abstract art, is made possible because the human brain constructs what it experiences. When you view a cubist painting by Picasso and see recognizable human figures, that happens only because you have memories of human figures that help your brain make sense of the abstract elements. The painter Marcel Duchamp once said that an artist does only 50 percent of the work in creating art. The remaining 50 percent is in the viewer’s brain. (Some artists and philosophers call the second half “the beholder’s share.”) (Location 700)


> Your aches and jitters and other inner sensations are some combination of what’s going on in your brain and what’s actually happening within your lungs and heart and gut and muscles and so on. Your brain also adds information from your past experiences to guess what those sensations mean. (Location 710)


> Neuroscientists like to say that your day-to-day experience is a carefully controlled hallucination, constrained by the world and your body but ultimately constructed by your brain. It’s not the kind of hallucination that sends you to the hospital. It’s an everyday kind of hallucination that creates all your experiences and guides all your actions. (Location 722)


> This whole constructive process happens predictively. Scientists are now fairly certain that your brain actually begins to sense the moment-to-moment changes in the world around you before those light waves, chemicals, and other sense data hit your brain. The same is true for moment-to-moment changes in your body​—​your brain begins to sense them before the relevant data arrives from your organs, hormones, and various bodily systems. You don’t experience your senses this way, but it’s how your brain navigates the world and controls your body. (Location 726)


> Predictions let you read the squiggles on this page and understand them as letters and words and ideas. They’re also the reason why it feels unsatisfying when a sentence is missing its final. (Location 735)


> In a very real sense, predictions are just your brain having a conversation with itself. A bunch of neurons make their best guess about what will happen in the immediate future based on whatever combination of past and present that your brain is currently conjuring. Those neurons then announce that guess to neurons in other brain areas, changing their firing. Meanwhile, sense data from the world and your body injects itself into the conversation, confirming (or not) the prediction that you’ll experience as your reality. (Location 749)


> In actuality, your brain’s predictive process is not quite so linear. Usually your brain has several ways to deal with a given situation, and it creates a flurry of predictions and estimates probabilities for each one. Is that rustling sound in the forest due to the wind, an animal, an enemy fighter, or a shepherd? Is that long, brown shape a branch, a staff, or a rifle? Ultimately, in each moment, some prediction is the winner. Often, it’s the prediction that best matches the incoming sense data, but not always. Either way, the winning prediction becomes your action and your sensory experience. (Location 753)


> So, your brain issues predictions and checks them against the sense data coming from the world and your body. What happens next still astounds me, even as a neuroscientist. If your brain has predicted well, then your neurons are already firing in a pattern that matches the incoming sense data. That means this sense data itself has no further use beyond confirming your brain’s predictions. What you see, hear, smell, and taste in the world and feel in your body in that moment are completely constructed in your head. By prediction, your brain has efficiently prepared you to act. (Location 757)


> Brains aren’t wired for accuracy. They’re wired to keep us alive. (Location 770)


> Now here’s the final nail in the coffin of common sense: All this predicting happens backward from the way we experience it. You and I seem to sense first and act second. You see an enemy and then raise your rifle. But in your brain, sensing actually comes second. Your brain is wired to prepare for action first, like moving your index finger onto a trigger and making body-budgeting changes to support that movement. It’s also wired to route these predictions to your sensory systems, which predict the feeling of cold steel on your fingertip and your racing heartbeat. In the case of our soldier friend, his brain heard rustling leaves, moved his hands on the gun, and guided itself to see enemies that weren’t present. (Location 773)


> But the brain is a predicting organ. It launches your next set of actions based on your past experience and current situation, and it does so outside of your awareness. In other words, your actions are under the control of your memory and your environment. (Location 780)


> You can invest a little time and energy to learn new ideas. You can curate new experiences. You can try new activities. Everything you learn today seeds your brain to predict differently tomorrow. (Location 794)


> Research shows that students can learn to experience their physical sensations not as anxiety but as energized determination, and when they do, they perform better on tests. That determination seeds their brains to predict differently in the future so they can get their butterflies flying in formation. (Location 798)


> Pick a controversial political issue that you feel strongly about. In the United States, that might be abortion, guns, religion, the police, climate change, reparations for slavery, or perhaps a local issue that’s important to you. Spend five minutes per day deliberately considering the issue from the perspective of those you disagree with, not to have an argument with them in your head, but to understand how someone who’s just as smart as you can believe the opposite of what you do. I’m not asking you to change your mind. I’m also not saying this challenge is easy. It requires a withdrawal from your body budget, and it might feel pretty unpleasant or even pointless. But when you try, really try, to embody someone else’s point of view, you can change your future predictions about the people who hold those different views. If you can honestly say, “I absolutely disagree with those people, but I can understand why they believe what they do,” you’re one step closer to a less polarized world. This is not magical liberal academic rubbish. It’s a strategy that comes from basic science about your predicting brain. (Location 808)


> This co-regulation has measurable effects. Changes in one person’s body often prompt changes in another person’s body, whether the two are romantically involved, just friends, or strangers meeting for the first time. When you’re with someone you care about, your breathing can synchronize, as can the beating of your hearts, whether you’re in casual conversation or a heated argument. This sort of physical connection happens between infants and their caregivers, between therapists and their clients, and among people taking a yoga class or singing in a choir together. We often mirror each other’s movements in a dance that neither of us is aware of and that is choreographed by our brains. One of us leads, the other follows, and sometimes we switch. In contrast, when we don’t like or trust each other, our brains are like dance partners who step on each other’s toes. (Location 856)


> It’s metabolically costly for a brain to deal with things that are hard to predict. No wonder people create so-called echo chambers, surrounding themselves with news and views that reinforce what they already believe​—​it reduces the metabolic cost and unpleasantness of learning something new. Unfortunately, it also reduces the odds of learning something that might change a person’s mind. (Location 887)


> Why do the words you encounter have such wide-ranging effects inside you? Because many brain regions that process language also control the insides of your body, including major organs and systems that support your body budget. These brain regions, which are contained in what scientists call the “language network,” guide your heart rate up and down. They adjust the glucose entering your bloodstream to fuel your cells. They change the flow of chemicals that support your immune system. The power of words is not a metaphor. It’s in your brain wiring. We see similar wiring in other animals too; for example, neurons that are important for birdsong also control the organs of a bird’s body. (Location 909)


> It’s important to understand that the human brain doesn’t seem to distinguish between different sources of chronic stress. If your body budget is already depleted by the circumstances of life​—​like physical illness, financial hardship, hormone surges, or simply not sleeping or exercising enough​—​your brain becomes more vulnerable to stress of all kinds. This includes the biological effects of words designed to threaten, bully, or torment you or people you care about. (Location 926)


> Simply put, a long period of chronic stress can harm a human brain. Scientific studies are absolutely clear on this point. When you’re on the receiving end of ongoing insults and threats, for example, studies show that you’re more likely to get sick. Scientists don’t understand all the underlying mechanisms yet, but we know it happens. (Location 931)


> The best thing for your nervous system is another human. The worst thing for your nervous system is also another human. This situation leads us to a fundamental dilemma of the human condition. Your brain needs other people in order to keep your body alive and healthy, and at the same time, many cultures strongly value individual rights and freedoms. Dependence and freedom are naturally in conflict. (Location 944)


> We also pay the costs of reduced innovation in a global economy, because when people are persistently stressed, they don’t learn as well. Creativity and innovation often mean failing repeatedly and having the tenacity to pick yourself up and try again. (Location 973)

> Scientists are often asked to make their research useful to everyday life. These scientific findings about words, chronic stress, and disease are a perfect example. There is a real biological benefit when people treat one another with basic human dignity. And if we don’t, there is also a real biological consequence, and it eventually trickles down to a financial and social cost for everyone. (Location 977)


> Sometimes it’s necessary to say things that other people find offensive or don’t like. That’s an essential part of democracy. But in these situations, do we just want to speak, or do we also want to be heard? If the latter, then our messages may be more effective if we give more consideration to how they’re delivered. The form of delivery can make an already difficult message easier or harder on a listener’s body budget. When we speak freely, it makes sense to communicate in ways that encourage others to listen. (Location 986)


> We’ve also learned that the mind and the body are strongly linked, and the boundary between the two is porous. Your brain’s predictions prepare your body for action and then contribute to what you sense and otherwise experience. (Location 1020)


> In short, a particular human brain in a particular human body, raised and wired in a particular culture, will produce a particular kind of mind. There is not one human nature but many. A mind is something that emerges from a transaction between your brain and your body while they are surrounded by other brains-in-bodies that are immersed in a physical world and constructing a social world. (Location 1022)


> Sadly, the MBTI’s scientific validity is pretty dubious. This test and its many cousins typically work by asking what you believe about yourself, which research suggests may have little to do with your actual behavior in daily life. (Location 1045)


> Brains have a lot of common features; minds, less so, because minds depend in part on micro-wiring that is tuned and pruned by culture. For example, many Western cultures draw strong dividing lines between the mental and the physical. If your stomach hurts, you’re likely to visit your primary care physician or a gastroenterologist; if you’re feeling anxiety, you’re more likely to see a psychologist, even if the symptoms and the underlying causes are identical. But in some Eastern cultures, such as those that practice Buddhism, mind and body are much more integrated. (Location 1057)


> you’re feeling anxiety, you’re more likely to see a psychologist, even if the symptoms and the underlying causes are identical. But in some Eastern cultures, such (Location 1059)


> An especially useful feature of the mind, and one of the closest things we have to a universal mental feature, is mood​—​the general sense of feeling that comes from your body. Scientists call it affect.* Feelings of affect range from pleasant to unpleasant, from idle to activated. Affect is not emotion; your brain produces affect all the time, whether you’re emotional or not and whether you notice it or not. (Location 1068)


> Your brain, however, makes meaning from this data storm continuously to predict your body’s next action and meet its metabolic needs before they arise. In the midst of all this activity inside you, something miraculous happens. Your brain summarizes what’s going on with your body in the moment, and you feel that summary as affect. (Location 1079)


> Scientists are still puzzling out how your brain’s body-budgeting activities, which are physical, become transformed into affect, which is mental. Hundreds of studies from laboratories around the world, including mine, observe that it happens, yet this transformation from physical signals to mental feelings remains one of the great mysteries of consciousness. It also reaffirms that your body is part of your mind​—​not in some gauzy, mystical way but in a tangible, biological way. (Location 1088)


> We need brains that cooperate on a vast geographical scale. Even the most mundane act, like reaching into a kitchen cupboard for a can of beans, is possible only because of other humans. Other humans planted and watered those beans, perhaps thousands of miles away. Other humans mined the metal for the can. Still other humans transported the beans to your local store, which was built by other humans with wood and nails and bricks that were manufactured and hauled by other humans, using techniques and tools invented by other humans long dead. You paid for the beans with money that was invented and blessed by a government of other humans. Thanks to a shared social reality, all these thousands of people were in the right place at the right time doing the right things for you to grab the can and make dinner. (Location 1159)


> In short: The wiring of your cerebral cortex makes compression possible. Compression enables sensory integration. Sensory integration enables abstraction. Abstraction permits your highly complex brain to issue flexible predictions based on the functions of things rather than on their physical form. That is creativity. And you can share these predictions by way of communication, cooperation, and copying. That is how the Five Cs empower a human brain to create and share social reality. (Location 1206)


> The scientific name for body budgeting is allostasis: Allostasis is not the only factor influencing how brains evolve and how they work, but it’s a big one. Allostasis is a predictive balancing process over time, not a process that seeks a single, stable point for the body to maintain (it’s not like a thermostat). The word for seeking a single, stable point is homeostasis. See 7half.info/allostasis. (Location 1410)


> The idea of worthwhile movement is well studied in the field of economics, where it’s called value. See 7half.info/value. (Location 1415)


> In the same way that the motor movements of your arms, legs, head, and torso produce sense data that is relayed to your brain (specifically, to the somatosensory system), visceromotor movements produce sensory changes, called interoceptive sense data, that are sent to your brain (to the interoceptive system). All this sense data helps your brain better control your motor and visceromotor movements. (Location 1426)


> In the late 1940s, the neuroscientist Paul MacLean transformed Papez’s “cortical circuit” into a full-fledged limbic system and embedded it within a three-layered brain that he named the triune brain. See 7half.info/triune. (Location 1454)


> (As Henry Gee says in his book The Accidental Species: Misunderstandings of Human Evolution, science is a process of quantifying doubt.) (Location 1464)


> Learn more in Stuart Firestein’s books Failure: Why Science Is So Successful and Ignorance: How It Drives Science. See 7half.info/triune-wrong. (Location 1470)


> There is no such thing as a limbic system dedicated to emotions: Even though the limbic system is a myth, your brain does contain something called limbic circuitry. Neurons in limbic circuitry connect to the brain stem nuclei that regulate your autonomic nervous system, immune system, endocrine system, and other systems whose sense data create interoception, your brain’s representation of the sensations in your body. Limbic circuitry is not exclusive to emotion and is distributed across multiple brain systems. It includes subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus and the central nucleus of the amygdala; allocortical structures, such as the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb; and parts of the cerebral cortex, such as the cingulate cortex and the anterior part of the insula. See 7half.info/limbic (Location 1520)


> we’re just an interesting sort of animal: This idea comes from Henry Gee’s book The Accidental Species. See 7half.info/interesting (Location 1534)


> Through this process, one individual neuron influences thousands of others, and thousands of neurons can influence one, all simultaneously. This is the brain in action. See 7half.info/wiring. (Location 1565)



> “the beholder’s share”: This idea about the perception of artwork originated with the art historian Alois Riegl, who called it “the beholder’s involvement.” The later term beholder’s share was coined by art historian Ernst Gombrich. See 7half.info/art. (Location 1642)


> an everyday kind of hallucination: I referred to conscious perception and experience as an everyday hallucination for a number of years before discovering that philosopher Andy Clark eloquently makes the same point, calling conscious experience a “controlled hallucination.” See his book Surfing Uncertainty: Prediction, Action, and the Embodied Mind. Today, other scientists also describe experience in this way, notably the neuroscientist Anil Seth in his engaging TED Talk “Your Brain Hallucinates Your Conscious Reality.” See 7half.info/hallucination. (Location 1645)


> many brain regions that process language also control the insides of your body: The brain regions that scientists call the “language network” overlap to a large extent with a network called the “default mode network,” particularly on the left side of the brain. The default mode network is part of a larger system that controls the internal systems of your body, including your autonomic nervous system (which controls your cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and other organ systems), immune system, and endocrine system (which controls hormones and metabolism). See 7half.info/language-network. (Location 1657)


> Feelings of affect range from pleasant to unpleasant, from idle to activated: Affect is described by a mathematical structure depicted in the figure on page 105, called a circumplex, which was first discussed by the psychologist James A. Russell. A circumplex represents relations using the geometry of a circle; in this case, the relations among affective feelings. The term circumplex means “circular order of complexity” to indicate that the feelings in question are characterized simultaneously by at least two basic psychological features. The circle maps how similar the feelings are to one another, and the two dimensions describe the properties of similarity. See 7half.info/circumplex (Location 1737)
