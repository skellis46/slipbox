# Suchman - comparing domains of improvisation 

_previous note:_ [[Tim Ingold - Making]]

These quotes are from a presentation that Suchman gave in 2020 at Columbia University

> Thomas Gladwin (1964) has written a brilliant article contrasting the method by which the Trukese [of Micronesia] navigate the open sea, with that by which Europeans navigate. He points out that the European navigator begins with a plan – a course – which he has charted according to certain universal principles, and he carries out his voyage by relating his every move to that plan … The Trukese navigator begins with an objective rather than a plan. He sets off toward the objective and responds to conditions as they arise in an ad hoc fashion. He utilizes information provided by the wind, the waves, the tide and current, the fauna, the stars, the clouds, the sound of the water on the side of the boat, and he steers accordingly. His effort is directed to doing whatever is necessary to reach the objective. If asked, he can point to his objective at any moment, but he cannot describe his course.[Berreman 1966: 347 in @suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]


> Although the objective of the Trukese navigator is clear from the outset, his actual course is contingent on unique circumstances that he cannot anticipate in advance. The plan of the European, in contrast, is derived from universal principles of navigation and is [taken to be] independent of the exigencies of his particular situation.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]

> In the pages that follow, however, I argue that all activity, even the most analytic, is fundamentally concrete and embodied. So although there must certainly be an important relationship between ideas about action and ways of acting, this first interpretation of the navigation example stands in danger of confusing theory with practice.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]


- what of actions that are not instrumental? There is no purpose other than being in direct experience. Nothing is gained, nothing is lost. No objective is reached. It's in the word objective: striving towards the object. 

- raises questions of in/determinacy -- the lure or perhaps illusion of indeterminacy in human actions (improvisation being the most startling in which we talk the talk of indeterminacy)

> I see my choice of the term ad hoc here as an unfortunate one, particularly in light of subsequent readings of the text. The problem lies in the term’s common connotations of things done anew, without reference to historically constituted or broader concerns. Perhaps a better way of phrasing this would be to say that situated actions are always, and irremediably, contingent on specific, unfolding circumstances that are themselves substantially constituted through those same actions. This is the case however much actions may also be informed by prescriptive representations, past experience, future considerations, received identities, entrenched social relations, established procedures, built environments, material constraints, and the like. To be rendered effective the significance and relevance of any of those must be reiterated, or transformed, in relation to what is happening just here and just now.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]

> So I’m thinking about improvisation here in the somewhat unconventional sense not of the alternative to ‘executing’ a plan or procedure, but as what is actually required to do that; the improvisation necessary for accountable action. We could take the favourite analogy in computer science, which compares an algorithm to a recipe. How can we recognise the difference between cooking according to a recipe and inventing a new dish, and/but also the necessary improvisation presupposed by the recipe? This has implications for grasping both the determinate relation of code to computational processes, and the irremediable indeterminacies and contingencies of computing in and as social practice.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]

- make a custard (touches more on Ingold's work re craft and deeply understood practices that are learned without learning or knowing that one is learning)

- what does Lucy mean by computing in and as social practice? 


> In my current work I focus on the military concept of ‘situational awareness,’ and more specifically the requirements of ‘positive identification’ and ‘imminent threat’ that underwrite the canons of legalized killing. I’m thinking about the trope of ‘situational awareness’ through related questions of intelligibility and identification, and more particularly through a frame inspired by Judith Butler’s theoretical analysis of recognition’s performative and generative agencies.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.] 

- performative recognition! amazing

> It’s there, I argue, that it’s helpful to articulate differences in the resources available to people and machines in constructing a mutually intelligible world.  Articulating those differences suggests the value of a shift from treating machines as almost or quasi humans, to recognizing their particular, machinic agencies.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]

- what might a mutually intelligible world now look like? (since you wrote this in 2020). Not least because of how AI seems to have entered the cultural imaginary with quite a bang in the last 6-12 months -- you described it even then as a 'frenzy'

> ‘AI’ is a cover term for a range of technologies of data processing and techniques of data analysis based on the iterative adjustment of relevant parameters, according to some combination of internally and externally generated feedback. 
> This definition is not meant to understate the extraordinary scale and complexity of the multi-dimensional models and the layered architectures of so-called machine or ‘deep’ learning systems, or the exponentially growing speed and storage capacity of the hardware that enables them. But it is meant to underscore that these are elaborations of pattern identification based not on significance (or learning) in the human sense, but on computationally detectable correlations that, however meaningless, selectively produce results that are legible to humans. From training data to the assessment of results, it is humans who inform the input and find significance in the output of an algorithmic system’s operations.[@suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.] 

Anatomy of an AI system by Kate Crawford 1 and Vladan Joler 2. https://anatomyof.ai

From Crawford and Joler:

> ‘In this fleeting moment of interaction, a vast matrix of capacities is invoked: interlaced chains of resource extraction, human labor and algorithmic processing across networks of mining, logistics, distribution, prediction and optimization. The scale of this system is almost beyond human imagining. How can we begin to see it, to grasp its immensity and complexity as a connected form?’[Crawford and Joler, in @suchman-2020-comparing n.pag.]
