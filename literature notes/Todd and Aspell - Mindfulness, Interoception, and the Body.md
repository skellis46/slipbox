# Todd and Aspell - Mindfulness, Interoception, and the Body

_previous note:_ [[interoception]]

_chatGPT summary:_ 

> This research article explores the relationship between interoception (the body's ability to sense internal states) and mindfulness. It discusses how mindfulness practices, which involve attention to body sensations, can influence interoceptive processes. The article reviews various studies on the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on interoceptive abilities in both clinical (e.g., substance use disorders, depression, suicidal ideation) and non-clinical populations. Findings indicate that mindfulness can enhance interoception and potentially improve symptoms related to various mental health conditions. However, the extent of this impact varies depending on the type of mindfulness practice and individual differences. The article suggests more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and to personalize mindfulness and interoceptive interventions for different psychological disorders.

> In terms of defining interoception, researchers have recently acknowledged that it can be broadly defined as a collection of processes through which the nervous system senses, interprets, integrates and regulates information originating inside the body, providing a moment-by-moment mapping of the body’s internal environment [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B2-brainsci-12-00696),[5](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B5-brainsci-12-00696)].

> However, there does not appear to be a consistent relationship between mindfulness and other components of interoception, such as interoceptive accuracy [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B18-brainsci-12-00696),[19](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B19-brainsci-12-00696)]. The interaction likely depends on the type of mindfulness practise employed and the timescale considered; for example, increases in interoceptive accuracy have been observed in training programmes utilising body scan mediations over a period of eight weeks [[20](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B20-brainsci-12-00696)] or over nine months of engaging in contemplative practices [[21](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B21-brainsci-12-00696)].

> Here, the authors found that participants with depression had a significant decrease in depression symptoms, and an increase in trait mindfulness and interoceptive abilities (heartbeat tracking task scores, task-related confidence ratings, and scores on the Body Awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire), following the four-week CBT programme.

> Furthermore, Smith and colleagues [[27](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B27-brainsci-12-00696)] found that Reconnecting to Internal Sensations and Experiences (RISE)—a four-session mindfulness-informed intervention designed to reduce suicidal ideation by improving interoception (first tested in US adults; [[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B31-brainsci-12-00696)])—had good levels of acceptability, and was associated with improvements in interoceptive dysfunction and reductions in suicidal ideation in a sample of Indian adults.

> In the current Special Issue, Schillings and colleagues [[34](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B34-brainsci-12-00696)] report a study that investigated whether a single twenty-minute yoga session would have any effects on interoceptive accuracy and emotional experience. Compared to participants assigned to an inactive control or endurance session, the yoga session participants showed no significant changes in interoception (measured via the heartbeat tracking task), nor any changes in affect. The authors suggest that the negative findings are due to an insufficiently long engagement with the practise: it may be that a longer course of multiple yoga sessions would be needed to increase body awareness and to have consequent effects on interoceptive accuracy. They also acknowledge the limitation of using only a single measure of interoception, namely the heartbeat tracking task, the validity of which has been criticised heavily in the recent literature (e.g., [[35](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B35-brainsci-12-00696)]). Future research should employ additional/alternative measures of interoception, including self-report measures, and examine the effects of multiple and/or longer yoga sessions.

> The authors employed the following multidimensional definition of body awareness: “the subjective, phenomenological aspect of proprioception and interoception that enters conscious awareness, which is modifiable by mental processes including attention, interpretation, appraisal, beliefs, memories, conditioning, attitudes and affect”, from Mehling and colleagues [[37](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B37-brainsci-12-00696)]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6tr4wtjf62pj8atvjp8hwh2))


> A number of authors have suggested that there are two main ‘attention/attitude styles’ towards bodily sensations. Maladaptive BA is avoidant, evaluative and linked to anxiety and other negative emotional states, whereas adaptive BA is accepting, non-judgmental and related to wellbeing [[38](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B38-brainsci-12-00696)]. There is some evidence that adaptive BA can be trained using mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs; [[39](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/6/696#B39-brainsci-12-00696)]) but few studies have tested this with studies of sufficient power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6trjwrzjm17gqw1gtfh55w7))


> In sum, the articles indicate that mindfulness interventions may exert some of their effects via changes to interoceptive processing, in both clinical and non-clinical samples, but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms.
