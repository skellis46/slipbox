## Highlights

> Flour, water & salt + Culture, warmth & time = Sourdough (Location 123)


> Sourdough is the oldest way of making bread, and uses naturally occurring wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria. It produces bread with a distinctive taste, but it is about far more than amazing flavour and nutrition. The process of baking sourdough is sensuous and nurtures both mind and body, and requires a thoughtful and spiritual approach. Artistic and scientific, it is a combination of passion, patience, dedication and craftsmanship. It is about connection, using hands, touch, smell, taste, sight, heat and mind. (Location 127)


> Sourdough is bread made from flour, water and salt and fermented using lactic acid bacteria and wild yeast. (Location 140)


> It is a web – the soil is full of microbes, a sourdough starter is full of microbes, our digestive systems are full of microbes. (Location 227)


> These revealed that in the last 20 years the use of glyphosate in UK farming has increased by 400%. Furthermore, it is one of the three pesticides regularly found in routine testing of British bread, appearing in up to 30% of samples tested by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Location 258)


> Triticum aestivum, or bread wheat, is the most widely grown of all crops and represents about 95% of all wheat grown. (Location 266)


> When we harvest these grains and grind them into flour the organic reactions remain the same, and as the enzymes break down the starch into sugar, so the lactic acid and wild yeasts benefit from the transformative abilities of the many enzymes. If you think about flour in this way, the whole sourdough process makes more sense. It reacts as though it is about to grow into a plant as you add the water. (Location 272)


> The flour you use also dictates, to a large extent, the speed of fermentation. Flour contains amylase, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into sugars that the yeasts can access. A flour’s enzyme levels will depend on where in the world it was grown. British flours tend to have high levels of naturally occurring enzymes because they are grown in a maritime environment. This results in high levels of enzyme activity, which means that dough ferments more quickly, yeasts are more active and more carbon dioxide is produced, making the bread more bouncy and voluptuous. You will sometimes find flours that have had enzymes added to them – flours from the USA, for example, tend to have less naturally occurring enzymes so millers make adjustments using malt and alpha-amylase to get the liveliness and activity needed.

> Check that your base white flour is between 11–13% protein. Lower protein flours need less water. (Location 995)


> The bassinage method ensures that the gluten develops and you don’t flood your bread. (Location 997)


> 1. Refresh your starter 2. Make your leaven 3. Mix the dough 4. Autolyse 5. Add the salt 6. Bulk fermentation 7. Shaping your loaf 8. Prove 9. Score 10. Bake (Location 1004)


> HOW TO REFRESH AND MAINTAIN 25g white starter 100g organic white flour 100g water at 36°c Mix all the ingredients in a pot, leaving room for the starter to rise again by half. Cover with a breathable lid and leave to ferment at an ambient temperature of 20–23°C for 8–10 hours. Ideally use straight away to make a leaven. If that’s not possible, refrigerate and use to make a leaven within 8 hours. Refrigerate the remainder in a covered pot until next needed. Refresh at least twice a week. (Location 1046)


> We make our own muesli, but if you are buying your mix look for one that’s organic with no added sugar and packed with nuts, seeds and malted flakes. Some varieties of muesli will need more water than others to make the right consistency porridge, so the amount of water advised is approximate. (Location 2178)
