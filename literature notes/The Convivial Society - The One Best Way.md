## Highlights

> The 20th century French polymath, Jacques Ellul, wrote around 50 books, but he is best remembered for *[The Technological Society](https://substack.com/redirect/a6d624f6-241e-4244-87f2-ed3e16c8fdc3?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* . ¹ And this fat book, stuffed with countless examples, basically conveys a single overarching idea: modern society is ordered by one master principle, which Ellul, in French, called *la technique* .
>  The standard definition of *technique* from Ellul goes like this: “Technique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity.”
>  That may not be the most elegant or memorable formulation. Lately, I’ve been summing up Ellul’s *technique* by describing it as the relentless drive to optimize all human experience for efficiency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22ca1tmbs567g9td05satfz))


> So, for example, in *The Technological Society* Ellul wrote, “This ‘one best way’ becomes a dogma that applies to increasingly more aspects of life. This destroys choice. Nothing can compete with technique.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22ca8sedt3kdr84sc03299r))


> I would submit that digital technology, broadly speaking, has been the “new technique of organization” that has brought the different pieces together and enabled the very fast development of human techniques about which Ellul warned. Digital tools have made it possible to measure, quantify, analyze, and regiment ever larger swaths of human experience, and so often with the implicit promise of disclosing the “one best way.” As Ellul put it, a society ordered by *technique* “can only act on man by lessening him and putting him in the way of the quantitative.” And digital technologies excel at putting us in the way of the quantitative.
