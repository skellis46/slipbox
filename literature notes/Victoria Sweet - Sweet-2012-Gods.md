## Highlights

> She did so slowly, like a gardener, by fussing and fiddling, doing a little of this and a little of that. Then she waited to see what would happen. Which is to say that she followed the patient’s body; she did not lead. (Location 661)

> In many ways it had been the right decision, but, like so many of our society’s decisions that end up as laws, it was intractable. It was a law. And, while medicating people because they don’t conform to our ideas of rationality had been incorrect, the more I saw of people like Jimmy—of the acutely psychotic, the real schizophrenic—the more inclined I was to believe that schizophrenia was not primarily a mental affliction, but a physical disease with mental concomitants. (Location 944)


> He reminded me of an aphorism I loved but had never understood: “The secret in the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.” I’d always assumed that it meant caring about the patient—loving or at least liking the patient—but when I saw Dr. Curtis rushing off to put shoes on a patient he barely knew, I thought there must be more to it than that. So I tracked down the quote and found it in a talk by Dr. Francis Peabody to the graduating medical class of Harvard in 1927. It turned out that Dr. Peabody didn’t mean caring about a patient but caring for a patient, which, he explained, meant doing the little things, the little personal things that nurses usually do—adjusting a patient’s bedclothes or giving him sips of water. That took time, Dr. Peabody admitted, and wasn’t, perhaps, the most efficient way for doctors to spend their time. But it was worth it, he told his students, because that kind of time-costly caring was what created the personal relationship between patient and doctor. And that relationship was the secret of healing. So what Dr. Peabody really was saying was that the secret in the care of the patient was—inefficiency. (Location 1177)


> I didn’t like their title though. It was too bland, too nondescript for what they were trying to do. The French is better: Activity therapy is called animation and the activity therapist an animatrice, as in anima—that which animates the body, which makes it come alive and stay alive, and which leaves the body after death. (Location 2456)


> They were not very good dancers, kind of stiff and slow, but they were enthusiastic, and I stopped to watch. The patients sat in various attitudes of attention and slumber, and none was brave enough to join them. Suddenly one nurse threw out both arms and pulled up a patient to dance with her. It was Mr. Bramwell. He stood for a moment in front of her, confused and uncertain. He swayed a little, and I was afraid he might fall. With his slack jaw and open mouth, he stared at the nurse, puzzled. Then, slowly, he lifted his right hand and took her left hand, and her right hand in his left, and he began to dance. And though he no longer remembered how to talk, how to clean himself, and barely how to eat, he wasn’t a bad dancer. Actually, he was a very good dancer. After a few turns with the first nurse, he held out his hand in a gentlemanly way to another nurse, and she obliged him and stepped up. And then he was spinning her under his arm, twirling her in and out and smiling—just a bit, not too much. He was manly, in control, and suddenly young. Though he’d forgotten everything else, he still did know how to dance, and with the dancing, he remembered not only his steps but his style, his manners, and his charm. The music stopped eventually, and Mr. Bramwell stopped, too. He slumped, he stooped, he came to a halt; he forgot the dancing and shuffled with the nurse back to his ward. (Location 2473)


> That is what the word hospitality encodes. And in a hospital, the meaning of that interchangeability is even more profound, because in the hospital, every host will for sure become a guest; every doctor, a patient. (Location 2524)


> Community comes from the Latin communio, for which the Oxford Latin Dictionary gives two derivations. Communio as a verb comes from munio—wall—and means “to build a wall around.” So a community is defined by the wall—symbolic or otherwise—around it. Everything inside the wall is the community, and everything outside the wall isn’t. (Location 2804)


> But communio as a noun derives from munis—gift; so communio also means “those who share a gift in common.” That was true of the hospital’s community, too, though it was not as obvious as the wall. At the Teals’ wedding, when I saw almost all of Laguna Honda pouring into that church, sitting rapt during their vows, and, yes, even crying, I understood that it wasn’t only me who was interested in the Teals, who made time, who was touched by them. Almost everyone was there; the wedding was a gift we shared in common, and that sharing made us a community. (Location 2810)


> I was happy and knew I was happy, the happiest I’d ever been. Not blissful, joyous, angels-coming-out-of-the-clouds happy, but happy as in “a feeling of great pleasure or contentment of mind, arising from satisfaction with one’s circumstances.” Happy from hap, as in what happens—things as they turn out to be. (Location 3003)


> Although the men of E4 were complicated and sick, they were not withdrawn or depressed but open-faced, flirtatious, and handsome. There was a reason for their good looks: No ugly person would have survived what they had survived. Even in orphanages, on the streets, and in prison, handsome people get special treatment. And the men of E4 knew that they were handsome, which is why they were flirtatious. (Location 3023)


> Whenever I walked past him in that busy, hectic ward, repository of so much damage, so much sadness, Mr. Gillon recalled me to myself. He reminded me that there were more ways to be of use than to be of use; that there was something to be said for pure existence; that none of us knows what is valuable to God. Isn’t the Buddha’s description of nirvana “no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind”? And hadn’t Mr. Gillon unwittingly achieved it? (Location 3072)


> The charity I meant was nothing organized. It was not in the hospital’s mission statement, on its new website, or in the PowerPoint presentations of middle management. And yet charity, in the medieval sense of a “personal action evoked by dearness and contributing to the well-being of its giver as well as its receiver,” was as much built into the place as its arches, bell tower, and church. (Location 3258)


> The Greeks called that emotion eleos, I later discovered, and defined it as the “feeling of pain caused by the sight of some evil that befalls one who doesn’t deserve it.” The pleasure I felt was, in part, the relief of pain by giving. Eleos gave the Latin eleemosyna, the French aumone, and eventually even our English alms. The emotion of eleos was why Laguna Honda had been built as an almshouse in the first place and why it was still an almshouse despite its name, because eleos—alms, charity—was still one of its main motivating forces. (Location 3279)


> What he’d taught me, I understood at that moment, was integrity—from integer, wholeness—from integro—untouched, unhurt. It wasn’t that I’d lacked integrity before I knew him, but I’d accepted the teaching that a good doctor does not get too close to his patient. (Location 3566)


> Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disease: a faulty enzyme causes the muscles to deteriorate. It runs in families. The girls are carriers; the boys are affected as children and usually die in their teens. (Location 3670)


> Besides, he’d taught me something unique. The sound of his sister’s voice, “You mean—like muscular dystrophy?” echoed in my ears for years, and even to this day, as a reminder of how much we don’t know about our patients or, for that matter, about one another. There’s so much experience in a single life, in a single day. Even with all the questions in the history, there was so much I would never know about my patients. (Location 3716)
