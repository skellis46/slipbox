# Michael Taft - The Mindful Geek Secular Meditation for Smart Skeptics

_previous note:_ [[AIDAN LYON - What Is Meditation, and Why Should You Do It]]

> The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a technology as “the practical application of knowledge, especially in a particular area.”

> Mindfulness meditation probably achieves this self-knowledge by actually growing the relevant areas of your brain. In the case of contacting your own feelings, the crucial area of the brain is known as the insula.29 You have one insula in each hemisphere of your brain, and the job of these structures is to allow you to detect your own internal body sensations (a skill known as interoception), as well as processing social emotions and even orgasms. A large number of studies have demonstrated that when you meditate, your insula grows larger and more convoluted.30 In other words, your brain actually gets better at consciously feeling what you’re feeling. You’ve got more processing power to bring to bear, more cycles per second to apply to the job.

> The ramifications of that statement (“All learning is neuroplasticity”) are immense. It means that you can almost “sculpt” your brain in an intentional and directed manner. Whatever you focus your attention on, regularly over time, will change the brain itself—physically alter it, some parts becoming larger or smaller—to get better at processing the thing you’re focusing on.

> mindfulness means paying attention to your present-moment sensory experience in a nonjudgmental manner. That’s the basic definition.

> But it was too much for a lot of people. Twenty-five percent of women, and a walloping 67 percent of men chose to self-administer a painful electric shock, rather than sit there quietly with their thoughts.

> As the researchers say in the paper: “This [difficulty controlling the mind] may be why many people seek to gain better control of their thoughts with meditation and other techniques, with clear benefits… Without such training, people prefer doing to thinking, even if what they are doing is so unpleasant that they would normally pay to avoid it. The untutored mind does not like to be alone with itself.”

> The results were fascinating. It turns out that it doesn’t matter much what activity a person is doing. Typically fun activities didn’t correlate much with happiness. Instead, what matters is whether you are paying attention to what you are doing. Focused attention was strongly correlated with feeling happy, whereas having a wandering mind was usually accompanied by unpleasant feelings. Interestingly, human beings are very prone to mind wandering. It occurred in nearly 50 percent of all samples.

> Mindfulness is the act of noticing sensory experiences, and each time you do this, you can make a label to help you focus on that experience.

> What’s the big deal with sitting still? Just like having an agitated mind makes you fidgety, having an antsy body stirs the mind. Remaining physically still creates a feedback loop with your mind and allows your thoughts to settle down. There are other factors as well, such as the fact that it’s much easier to meditate on subtle body sensations when you’re not moving around.

> Concentration means being able to train your attention on whatever object you choose, and sustain it there over time. Sensory clarity means having a lot of resolution of the details of whatever object you’re focusing on. Acceptance means having an attitude of openness, curiosity, and nonjudgment with whatever is happening in the moment.

> It’s important to notice that acceptance means accepting your sensory experience, not accepting the conditions of your life. You’re free to take all the actions necessary or desirable to make your life better. Acceptance doesn’t mean becoming passive or inactive. It just means that the current sensory experience is what it is, and you accept that part of things.

> “Contacting it deeply” means to actively explore your focus object with a lot of curiosity. You definitely do not want to let Step 2 be the end of the process. Here, we’re using the label as a signal to dig more deeply into the richness and depth of the experience. You want to get the sense that awareness is caressing, investigating, even permeating the focus object. Imagine that the sensations in your hand are a sponge, and that awareness is like water soaking into that sponge. It is “knowing” every bit of the sensations in your hand.

> more deeply into the richness and depth of the experience. You

> Get into every little micro detail of the sensations in your hand. The more you gently stretch yourself in the effort to investigate ever-subtler details of sensation, the more you’re building the part of your brain (the insula) which allows you to feel your own body. It takes effort, but the effort is not wasted.

> If you’re having difficulty accepting this fact, let me introduce you to a young man by the name of Roberto S. He is one of seventeen individuals in the United States who literally cannot feel pain due to a genetic condition known as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). Roberto is constantly laughing and smiling and is unusually happy. His mother couldn’t believe what a good baby he was, because he never cried about anything.

> In mindfulness meditation, the general stance is to attempt to accept and investigate all sensory experience, regardless of its hedonic tone. Unpleasant sensory experiences are greeted (at least in theory) just as readily as pleasurable ones. There are several good reasons to do this.

> The HPA system also releases neurotransmitters called catecholamines, particularly dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline. Catecholamines suppress the activity of the frontal lobes of your brain, making simple decision-making easier (fight or flight, anyone?), but hindering social interaction and complex task solving. They also trigger the amygdala—an area of the brain associated with an emotional response, usually fear—to have an appropriate response. These neurotransmitters then signal the hippocampus to store the fear and other data about the experience in long-term memory so that you know how to survive a tiger attack next time, if you survive.69

> Paying attention to the body is a radical act. We tend to think of the mind as transcendent, clean, pure, and perfect, whereas the body is limited, unclean, impure, and imperfect.

> Yet in mindfulness meditation, paying attention to the body is incredibly important. When you first begin to tune into body sensations in meditation, your mind will probably resist. Rather than feeling the body directly, it will usually try to think about the body. It will create mental pictures of the body parts and then imagine that they should be different. It may also get involved in a lot of imagination about medical conditions or illness. That’s what the mind does: it worries about the body, dislikes it, or tries to change it.

> Whatever its genesis, contacting the body is a particular challenge for non-kinesthetic people, but one that therefore has a greater payoff once it’s accomplished.

> Meditating on the body means meditating on body sensation, not on mental images of the body.

> When you meditate on the body in this way, it is vital that you learn to listen to the body as the body. You listen to it speaking in its native tongue, so to speak. What is the native language of the body? Its machine code? The native language of the body is sensation. It is feeling. If you want to deeply understand a foreign culture, the only way to do it is to learn the language. It’s the same with the body. If you really want to become mindful of body sensations, you have to learn to understand the language of the body. And what the body says in its native language may be very different from the things the mind says about it.

> Meditating on the body, then, is a bit like dancing. It’s not about feeling a certain way, or getting the body to do what you want it to. It’s about feeling how you feel, and not judging it, “correcting” it, or trying to change it. Instead, just accept the fact that your thoughts about the body and its characteristics and how it should be are sometimes very different than the actual feelings that occur in the body.

> On some level, we feel that if we just live right—if we just make enough money, if we just do X, Y, and Z—then nothing bad will happen to us or the people we love. This attitude means that the facts of the situation have been submerged beneath the surface of awareness, into the deep waters of the unconscious. That’s where meditation comes in.

> Meditation has been shown in several powerful studies to re-engineer your relationship to pain in a way that makes it much less difficult to bear. Mindfulness teaches you to feel your body sensations more accurately and completely, so you might think that that would make pain worse. And, indeed, fMRI studies show that long-term meditators do experience pain more completely—they are in essence meditating on the painful sensation, feeling it deeply. Non-meditators, on the other hand, show activation in the areas that suggest they are thinking about the pain. The paradoxical outcome of this is that the meditators actually have a much easier time bearing the pain. Why? Because they are not resisting it.78

> The equation is simple: P x R = S, or “pain times resistance equals suffering.” This means that your level of suffering from pain is dependent upon how much you can let go of resisting it. In other words, relief from pain is all about how much you can accept the pain. Don’t resist it, and you suffer much, much less. Japanese author Haruki Murakami has a famous quote, which sums up the situation nicely, “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.”

> This way of looking at emotions is so useful that there is a short mnemonic I want you to use whenever you’re trying to understand an emotion that you’re experiencing: just say to yourself “guidance system.” It forces you to look at an emotion for what it really is: an evolved response.

> The basic emotions are generally agreed to be fear, anger, sadness, disgust, and joy. (There are a surprising number of different lists.) They all shape our behavior in direct and specific ways. Fear gets you away from dangerous situations. Anger defends something you want, or drives away something you don’t want. Sadness lets you know when you made a mistake, essentially saying, “Don’t do that again.” Disgust keeps you away from disease agents and poisons. Joy lets you know when you did something right, saying, “Do that again.” These are evolved responses to motivate and direct us to make the most of various threats and opportunities.

> What about more complex emotions such as guilt, shame, embarrassment, and pride? Human beings evolved for millions of years to function as part of a group, and these emotions are specifically for social situations, helping us to navigate our behavior with our clan, tribe, or in-group. Guilt, shame, and embarrassment are all slightly different, but they essentially say, “I’ll never do that again” in a way that the whole group can read. Because the emotion plays a role in social interaction, it’s important that those around us can actually see our embarrassment and grok that we are embarrassed. The skin flush is therefore a clear signal to everyone around us.

> It’s impossible to be permanently happy because the system always corrects itself. No matter how far you push the needle away from zero into the realm of super happiness, your biology will adjust and make that place the new zero. It’s a self-adjusting, homeostatic system, and its tendency to return to a set-point is called “hedonic adaptation,” or the “hedonic treadmill.” (Hedonic, comes from the same root as “hedonism,” and means to pursue pleasure.)

> Neuroscientist and author Antonio Damasio calls one idea about how this works the “Somatic Marker Hypothesis,” or SMH. To understand the SMH, you first have to understand that emotions are primarily somatic events—that is, we know we’re having an emotion because we feel it in our body.

> In short: emotions are mainly embodied events.

> But recognizing that the emotions you’re feeling are not necessarily “yours” as much as they are a reaction is very useful.

> Third—and this is the big one—feeling bad doesn’t always mean that there’s something wrong with you, or that you did something wrong. We as a society are very intolerant (resistant, even) to the presence of unpleasant emotions. If you’re feeling bad, something is terribly wrong and we rush to fix it immediately. We do this even when the feeling response makes perfect sense. For example, Americans even take antidepressants after the death of a loved one, because the grief can be so intense.

> During the recent updating of the DSM-IV—the manual psychiatrists use to diagnose patients—they wanted to categorize grief as a mental illness! A suggestion that was thankfully vetoed. Grief feels very unpleasant, it’s true, but is that negative feeling actually a problem? Isn’t it a completely natural response to feel grief after someone you love dies? Would you want to somehow not feel it?

> When we see emotions in this light, we can begin to have an entirely different relationship to them. You start to understand that they are simply happening, like your heartbeat or your breathing. They are there to guide your behavior, not to make you feel good.

> Meditating on emotions in the body will, like other body sensation meditations, develop your insula,90 which is that part of your brain that is associated with (among other things) the feeling of visceral sensations.

> Body meditation practice will help you get better at sensing such sensations over time, something that Shinzen calls “skill at feeling.”91

> Viktor Frankl—the neurologist, psychologist, and Auschwitz survivor—once wrote that “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

> Think of all the times you’ve done something rash and regretted it afterward. Said something out of rage or spite that should never have been spoken. Think of all the urges, maybe even compulsions or addictions that you automatically respond to, even when you don’t want to. Meditation on emotions allows you to gain some measure of control; one might even dare to say wisdom, with respect to the expression of emotions. You are able to respond, rather than simply react.

> It can also make you dissociate. Dissociation happens when the feelings are so bad that you cannot bear to feel your body anymore at all, and you, metaphorically, “leave your body.” That means to lose direct conscious contact with most body sensations. It’s a common response for people who have PTSD. Dissociation feels like spacing out, blanking out, being half in a trance, or slightly on drugs.

> It’s good to connect with your feelings under normal conditions, but wading directly into an enormous flood of emotion that threatens to drown you is not recommended.

> Accomplishments — human beings find joy in pursuing success and mastery, even if it causes some difficulty and stress.

> Mindfulness is an excellent, concrete practice you can work with to find what is meaningful to you. The key is to remember that emotions are not in your head, they are embodied experiences. We may think of meaning as being mental or conceptual, but it is through the feelings in your body that you discover where meaning exists for you. What tugs at your heart.

> It’s possible to almost know “in advance” what you’re going to feel about something. This is not literal prediction, but rather you’re able to detect the faint stirrings of emotion about a topic or experience far sooner than you would have been able to previously. It almost feels like a kind of radar or early warning system for feelings. The normal everyday word for this capacity is intuition. It’s about becoming clearer about your own gut feelings. Intuition is not magic. It is eminently trainable and can be cultivated on purpose, using meditation.

> But once you can detect these sensations, you can tune into the explicit guidance they are offering you. They point toward something that is indispensable in life: knowing what you value.

> The only way to know is to think about it and feel what happens in your body. If the feeling of excitement, energy, or a tingling sensation is there, that is the sign that you still find this important. If not—or if you actually feel some subtle deflation, let down, or even negative feelings—maybe your interest in it is taking a momentary break, or you’ve moved on to other things.

> Have you ever been so involved in doing something that the rest of the world seemed to disappear? Or time slowed down, you felt wonderful, and even your sense of self disappeared? The great Brazilian soccer star Pele talked about an experience in which he felt:

> Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi—basically the living god of concentration theory—looked at people doing different activities in a state of high concentration, and found that they were generally calm, relaxed, open, and felt very good.

> If the concentration state went even deeper, time seemed to slow down or stop, and the sense of self diminished or disappeared, with only the sense of pleasurable and total involvement in the activity remaining.

> As Csikszentmihalyi defined it, flow is “being completely involved in an activity for its own sake.97 The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.”

> That sounds pretty mystical, but it’s actually totally normal, even mundane. We all get into a light flow state at least some of the time. A typical example of a flow state would be a crossword puzzle enthusiast focused on filling in the squares.

> It’s this last feature, skill, which is the critical factor in a flow experience. Across the board, people in a flow state describe the pleasure that comes from mastering a series of small challenges over and over. Flow does involve work, but it is work that you like doing and can do well. If a challenge is too difficult, frustration and disappointment arise, and that blocks the flow state. Flow has to involve a task you can actually achieve. On the other hand, if the task is too easy, it doesn’t capture your attention, and flow cannot happen either. You get bored and float away into distraction. In between anxiety when the task is too hard, and boredom when it’s too easy, there is a Goldilocks zone for the flow state; a condition of a task that is just right.

> Csikszentmihalyi’s formula for achieving flow involves manipulating the difficulty of the activity in order to induce it. You adjust the level of difficulty to match your skill level until you hit the Goldilocks zone. But there is another possibility that I don’t believe Csikszentmihalyi ever mentions: cultivating your ability to focus. Intentionally training your concentration ability so that it’s much stronger than normal. And, as you might have guessed by now, I’m here to tell you that meditation is a powerful and effective way to do just that. A host of studies have shown that one of the chief measurable effects of meditation training is to increase your attention levels.99

> meditation can achieve at the extreme end of the scale. The study used a phenomenon known as “attentional blink” to measure the subject’s ability to pay attention. Let’s say you flash a series of letters on a screen very quickly. Embedded in the series are two numbers. If the numbers are far enough apart in time, you will notice both. But if the numbers get close enough together in time, less than half a second apart, then subjects notice the first number, but miss the second one. There is a kind of “blink” in attention, a moment when your awareness is not involved in what you are doing.

> It’s one of the secrets to making meditation work for you in life: make the effort to meditate on things that are just slightly too hard for your focus ability. This stretches your capacity to handle the anxiety of a task that’s a little hard.

**Note:** In AM its the quantity of information that makes it difficult and yet it doesn't feel difficult

> As the founder of the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program popular in US hospitals, Jon Kabat Zinn, says, “When you pay attention to boredom, it gets unbelievably interesting.”

> Having media on in the background actually uses up a large portion of the neurons that could otherwise be employed on the task at hand. Think: one thing at a time.

> Mammals are wired to look for novelty in the environment, a behavior called “seeking.” In his research, neuroscientist and psychologist Jaak Panksepp discovered an interesting feature of the networks in mammalian brains, particularly rats. If you place an electrode in the area for sexual stimulation, for example, and provide the rat with a button that will stimulate the electrode, the rat will press it for a while, achieve satisfaction, and then stop pressing the button, until another day. He or she is now satisfied, and doesn’t look for further sexual stimulation. The same thing happens with hunger and sleep.

> The neuroscience behind this is fascinating, but the short version is this: your brain is wired to seek, and it gets a dopamine hit each time it does.103

> This means that the system in your brain is rigged: there seems to be much more drive to seek than to be rewarded. We would rather look than actually find.

> Our brains have an insatiable urge for seeking new things, but now we have a limitless source of novelty. We are stuffed beyond the limit with unprocessed, undigested, and unhelpful experiences that we cannot convert to energizing, useful, practical knowledge. We can’t stop pressing the seek button, looking for another hit of dopamine.

> The Greek philosopher Heraclitus said that you couldn’t step in the same river twice.

> Education is an excellent thing, but in our society we educate people into a mental/conceptual relationship with life and away from an experiential relationship with it.

> When was the last time you actually encountered a tree as a tree? It’s possible to see a tree as a sensory phenomenon: the rich texture and scent of the bark, the luscious colors of the leaves, the sound it makes as the wind passes through it, and so on. This is the sensory experience of a tree. Yet most of us pass dozens or hundreds of trees a day, and we notice none of these features. We barely encounter trees as sensory experiences at all. Instead, we simply reduce all this sensory richness into a single word, “tree,” and leave it at that. The word tree functions as a concept, or symbol—mental shorthand that allows us to shortcut having to actually encounter the tree.

> You’ve lost the connection to your senses; to what poet Mary Oliver calls “the soft animal of your body.”

> We evolved from animals, and we require a connection to our senses in order to feel safe, comfortable, happy, and joyous. This is what people are talking about when they talk about “embodiment.” Embodiment means being in touch with the lush world of the senses. The colors of light. The nuances of sound. The textures of touch. This is where connection to the world, the present moment, and the body exist. People use booze or other sedatives to knock their endless conceptual blather offline and get into their body, but this is a brute-force method with a lot of drawbacks, like hangovers and addiction. Plus it partially defeats itself, since it tends to be numbing to be the body, too. Drink may get you back in your senses, but your senses will be foggy and fuzzy.

> Default mode network activity is roughly the opposite of a flow state. In a flow state, you begin to lose your sense of self in a task; most thought is self-referential in the DMN. A flow state is intrinsically rewarding and serene, whereas mind wandering typically leaves you feeling bad. The essence of a flow state is concentrated activity; the DMN turns on when you are not focused on any activity. In fact, DMN activity is so closely associated with not paying attention that scientists found that they could use it to predict people making a mistake on a concentration task almost thirty seconds in advance—just by measuring an increase in DMN activity.146

> But there is a second kind of attention in which you don’t try to control which object you’re paying attention to at all. You allow your attention to wander wherever it likes. This second kind of attention is called “open awareness,” or “choiceless awareness.” The most important feature of open awareness is that it feels effortless.

> It sometimes helps to frame the Focus on Now practice as a strong acceptance meditation, because to sit and allow almost anything to unfold in meditation is a deeply accepting stance to take. Everything that arises, everything that occurs in your senses is fine. Everything. You’re just going to stay with it, no matter what it is.
