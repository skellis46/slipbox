# L. M. Sacasas - The Thing That Is Silence

_previous note:_ [[silence is a prerequisite for the apprehension of reality]]

> “When language ceases, silence begins,” [the Swiss philosopher Max] Picard explains early on. “But it does not begin *because* language ceases. The absence of language simply makes the presence of Silence more apparent.”

> At another point, Picard puts the matter this way:
>> Silence is not visible, and yet its existence is clearly apparent. It extends to the farthest distances, yet is so close to us that we can feel it as concretely as we feel our own bodies. It is intangible, yet we can feel it as directly as we feel materials and fabrics.

> In other places, Picard’s descriptions of the phenomenology of silence take on an almost mystical quality, and, indeed, Picard is a religious thinker. He writes, for example, “Silence contains everything within itself. It is not waiting for anything; it is always wholly present in itself and it completely fills out the space in which it appears.”

> For, as Picard puts it, “Man does not put silence to the test; silence puts man to the test.”

> But he immediately warns that “language becomes emaciated if it loses its connection with silence.” Thus Picard believes, writing in the mid-20th century, that the task before us “is to uncover the world of silence so obscured today—not for the sake of silence but for the sake of language.”

> Interestingly, Picard devotes a small chapter to the radio. Friends, it would be hard for me to overstate how much Picard appears to despise the radio. Although, to be fair, it is not radio itself he despises, but how the radio pushed silence to the margins of our experience by filling our spaces with a practically infinite supply of noise. You can imagine as well as I can how the advent of television, portable electronic devices, and finally the internet and smartphones have heightened the situation Picard found so distressing in his own age.

> Perhaps, we could just as easily say that everything that lives emerges from silence and however strong its tendency to express itself in sound it nevertheless needs the security of silence to express itself at all. Or something like that. The point is that we may need silence more than we’re willing to acknowledge and despite the fact that we have grown so uncomfortable with the presence of silence.

> “Words that merely come from other words are hard and aggressive,” he counsels. “Such words are also lonely, and a great part of the melancholy in the world today is due to the fact that man has made words lonely by separating them from silence.”

> “Words that merely come from other words.” Are these not the words we are now most likely to encounter given the immediacy, intensity, and scale of our digital milieu? Words that have not passed through silence, silence which might nurture mutual comprehension and considered responses, but have rather emerged reactively and kinetically, even violently, from other words.

> By contrast, Picard believes, “one can hear silence sounding through speech. Real speech is in fact nothing but the resonance of silence.” What would it mean for us to so nourish our words with silence that they may be described as the resonance of silence. Again, the language is figurative and evocative, but perhaps that this the only kind of language that will do to help us perceive these subtle realities.

> Picard asserts that “silence is the only phenomenon today that is ‘useless’.” “It does not fit into the world of profit and utility,” he continues, “it simply is. It seems to have no other purpose; it cannot be exploited.”

> This wholeness emerges from Picard’s metaphysical reflections on the nature of silence. At another point he speaks of silence as a substance that enters into us. That substance creates a buffer among the various, often conflicting realities within us. Our own contradictions must pass over the substance of silence before coming into contact with one another. In this way, silence is a substance protective of our inner life. Picard also suggests that “man is better able to endure things hostile to his own nature, things that use him up, if he has the silent substance within …. Technics in itself, life with machines, is not injurious unless the protective substance of silence is absent.”

> What are the practices that will sustain us? Silence may be just such a practice, and we may do well to experiment with whatever possibilities are afforded to us to enter into silence and to allow silence to enter into us.
