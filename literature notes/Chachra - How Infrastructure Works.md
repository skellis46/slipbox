# How Infrastructure Works by Deb Chachra

Central to any new order that can shape and direct technology and human destiny will be a renewed emphasis on the concept of justice. Ursula M. Franklin, The Real World of Technology


Scientists and engineers have a concept of elegance, which is among the highest praise that can be given to a theory, a proof, or a device. It’s hard to explain exactly what it is, but it incorporates ideas of efficiency or parsimony—accomplishing something with a minimum of effort, energy, or materials. Elegance in engineering often encompasses the surprising and very particular use of the specific resources that are available.


The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to keep fast typists from jamming the keys on manual typewriters, but it’s still in use on smartphone touchscreens.


Carl Sagan famously said, “If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, first you must invent the universe.” Ever since I was a kid, whenever I find myself someplace far from city lights on a clear night, I take some time and stare up at the stars. It reminds me that we’re all whirling through space, and that everything I can see in the sky will continue to move along its own path regardless of anything that happens on our planet.


“All of the stuff that you don’t think about” turns out to be a surprisingly good starting point. For something to be considered infrastructure, its presence and characteristics are taken as a given.


Helen introduced me to Richard Mabey’s idea that the natural world can only be understood and appreciated as a result of careful, knowledgeable attention. Without the ability to describe the differences with detail and specificity, a meadow of native grasses and the pesticide-soaked monoculture of a golf course that replaces it are effectively indistinguishable. Helen borrowed Mabey’s phrase for this in an interview, calling it a “green blur.”


Since they’re always there for my use, at any moment of the day, these infrastructural systems are all but part of me—they extend my capabilities beyond my biological limitations in a way that I almost never have to think about.


Alone at home I am a continent-spanning colossus, reaching out for my tiny share of these communal systems, whether it’s a few drops of water from my local reservoir via the municipal treatment plant or a few electrons getting a push from a dam in northern Quebec, thousands of miles away. If driving my car makes me a cyborg because it augments my individual body with a more powerful machine, then these systems make me part of, in the words of infrastructure researcher Paul Graham Raven, a “cyborg collective.”


For example, the process of refining the aluminum for the Red Bull can—separating the metal atoms from the oxygen atoms to which they’re tightly bound—requires electricity in such enormous amounts that researchers who work in sustainable design describe the material as “solid energy.”


Infrastructural systems make it easier for us to consume energy in this subtle way, as embodied energy over the entire life cycle of a product: in the extraction and distribution of the raw materials, in the manufacturing and distribution of the product, and in its disposal—whether landfilled, recycled, or upcycled—at the end of its useful lifetime.


Roads are perhaps the oldest systems that we would recognize as infrastructure. Humans have created paths for their entire existence as a species, just as other animals do, and for the same reason: as anyone who’s ever gone for a hike appreciates, it takes less energy to follow an existing trail than it does to create a new one. The act of following it often makes the trail wider or more distinct, and easier still to follow—to borrow the words of Paulo Freire, we make the road by walking.


The Nature of Technology, W. Brian Arthur makes the case that all technology has three elements. The first is that there must be some physical phenomenon at its root.


The second characteristic of technologies is that they are combined and assembled out of other technologies.


The third characteristic is, to my mind, the most interesting and subtle: technologies are recursive. If you look closely at any given technological artifact or process, you can observe that it’s created out of other technologies, and the same is true if you look more carefully at that technology, all the way down to some basic physical phenomenon


In The Real World of Technology, Ursula Franklin describes such a practice as a “holistic technology,” one in which a single person understands and has the skills and autonomy to carry out every step of the process, closely related to the idea of artisanal labor. Even today, there are people who raise sheep, turn their fleece into wool, and knit the wool into garments.


As a general rule, if it didn’t already exist about a hundred years ago, it’s not something that a single person could fully understand or create today. The fabric of daily life is created from technologies that have outpaced our ability as individuals to fully understand or recreate them. And that includes the technologies that are the interfaces to infrastructural networks.


Helen Macdonald, the naturalist and historian who talked about the “green blur,” also wrote about the times when their “attention has unaccountably snagged on something small and transitory” in the natural environment and how these elements serve as tiny portals, as long as the observer possesses a “sufficient quality of attention to see them at all. When they occur, and they do not occur often, these moments open up a giddying glimpse into the inhuman systems of the world that operate on scales too small and too large and too complex for us to apprehend.”

**Note:** Kinship film


The moment of noticing sparks Helen’s remembrance and awareness that they are surrounded by and embedded in the natural world, of the sea and sky and the land and the ecological systems that connect them through time, revealing the “numinous ordinary.”

**Note:** Kinship


The writer Tim Carmody has called this the “systemic sublime”—a parallel to Helen Macdonald’s numinous ordinary for human-created systems instead of the natural world.


If you’re reading this book, you’ve almost certainly had the feeling of glimpsing the systemic sublime, the human systems of the world that, in Helen’s words, operate on scales too small and too large and too complex for us to apprehend, vast and seemingly unknowable.


The brain-exploding insight, the one that we all live with whether we acknowledge it or not, is this: for a large fraction of humanity, the ways we meet our most basic needs, the ways we carry out the most routine and quotidian activities of our daily lives, and the material culture in which we are embedded are all beyond our capacity to understand, or even fully apprehend.


But unlike the “numinous ordinary,” which describes the natural world that has been evolving for many millions of years, the systemic sublime is about human-created systems. There is nothing natural or inevitable about the way they work.


Instead, the number of vehicles quickly increases to match the carrying capacity of the new road—a phenomenon known as induced demand—until the congestion is just as bad as before.


Pumped-storage hydroelectric stations are used globally but I love Dinorwig in particular because it really foregrounds how infrastructural systems are built to fulfill human desires, and how specific, contingent, and culturally situated these desires can be. What do people want? How can these desires be fulfilled? How are the desires of different communities balanced? How are the necessary resources distributed? These are political questions, not engineering questions. But in infrastructure, the political and the engineering questions are inextricably linked.


Over and over again, as new technological systems have been invented and the networks have begun to be built out, their efficiency, their value, and the way they enable personal, civic, and economic agency have been recognized, along with technical, social, and economic incentives to move toward universal provision—to treat the services they provide as a public good, in all senses of the phrase. It’s why good infrastructure is strongly correlated with not only access to resources, but with equitable, stable political systems.


As these infrastructural systems have grown in size, population reach, and geographic extent, the magnitude of harms—the negative impacts associated with vastly increased usage of energy and consumption of raw materials—has grown commensurately. It’s become possible to displace the harms of these systems farther and farther away, creating a severe moral hazard: any incentive to mitigate harms is reduced by the ability to retain the benefits while offloading the costs onto, bluntly, someone else. Or, in the case of pollutants in the oceans or the atmosphere, everyone else.


In Stafford Beer’s resonant phrasing, the purpose of a system is what it does. Infrastructural networks could be fairly described as vast constructions whose purpose is to centralize resources and agency to a small fraction of extremely privileged humans and to displace the harms to many others.


Borders, especially national borders, are the political determinants of where our physical bodies may be located. To the extent that infrastructural systems embody sustained relationships, borders set the terms of who gets to be in them.


Colonies were no longer subject to control by the military strength of the colonizers. (It’s not quite a joke that sixty-odd countries celebrating their independence from the British every year likely makes it the most widely observed secular national holiday in the world.)


Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is allowed to go everywhere, but people are not. And as the impacts of climate change increasingly take hold (to say nothing of other phenomena, like pandemics), one response will likely be increased political pressure to “secure the borders,” to make the fencing even higher and more deadly, a continuation of what’s already happening at the southern border of the United States or in the responses to migrant ships crossing the Mediterranean, where nationality becomes a life sentence.


(My friends who worry that I don’t get enough rest or relaxation have taken the opportunity to point me to an industrial safety sign that reads, “If you don’t schedule time for maintenance, your equipment will schedule it for you.”)


Locating buried infrastructure is such a clearly recognized skill that there’s even an International Utility Locate Rodeo, where workers compete to demonstrate their skill at finding belowground pipes and conduits.


One way of thinking about this is that infrastructural systems are defined not by what they are or what they are made from, but rather by relationships: between the various parts, and how they interact with other elements of the network, and how we interact with them.


But there is one final piece to this, which is that these systems can’t be static. Even if they’re thoughtfully designed, carefully built, and conscientiously maintained, that wouldn’t be enough, because the world that they are embedded in, and our understanding of it, changes with time.


But the widespread understanding at the time was that disease was linked not to the waste itself but to the foul smell that came along with it. Sickness was a result of breathing “bad air” (this idea lives on in the name for mosquito-borne “mal aria”). Avoiding disease meant avoiding this air by being on high ground or away from the densely populated city entirely.


The modern understanding among civil engineers is that, no matter what advertisements for bottled water might say, there is no water on earth that is pure or untouched. As my colleague Alison Wood, who researches wastewater systems, puts it: “all water is reused water.”


On that field trip to our local water treatment plant in Needham, we asked the staffers what concerns were on their radar. Their response: “PFAS.” Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a group of a thousand or more synthetic chemicals that first began to be used in industrial and consumer products in the 1940s but whose ecological and biological effects became a matter of widespread concern in the early 2000s. PFAS are sometimes known as “forever chemicals” because they are stable and long-lasting—Teflon is an example—which means it’s likely that they can accumulate in the environment and in body tissue. PFAS have mostly been manufactured and sold by only two companies, first DuPont and now 3M, but they are widely used and now found in drinking water and other sources.


What defines infrastructure is precisely that we don’t have to think about it. It’s not invisible so much as it’s transparent—we see through it to the tasks that it enables.


Infrastructural systems themselves are a form of care, made possible both by technologies and by the daily work of humans. But just as we still want to recognize, appreciate, and value the human caregiving labor that makes our lives possible, we need to do that for infrastructural systems too, including the people whose skill and labor keeps them functioning.


The journalist Michael Lewis described something that he calls “the fifth risk” in his book of the same name: it’s the risk a society runs when it falls into the habit of responding to long-term risks with short-term solutions.


But it’s still really clear to me that many of Rand’s ideas are prevalent in culture, especially American culture, and especially in engineering and technology: they prioritize making things over caregiving and maintenance, the new and novel over what’s sustained, ideas and artifacts that can deliver a profit over activities that need an ongoing commitment of money and other resources, and individualism over acting collectively. As an engineering professor, I see examples of this nearly every day. It’s all about “Design new things and change the world!” Don’t get me wrong—I like new things, all the fruits of the technological development that built the world we live in, as much as the next person. But our sustained and sustaining systems are widely considered unglamorous and boring.

**Note:** What do we need to sustain at work?


In the classic example, the time it takes for a string quartet to prepare for a recital hasn’t gotten any shorter in the past century, even as new technologies and modes of production have increased productivity and lowered costs in the world around them. Economists call this discrepancy “Baumol’s cost disease,” and even the name itself is a tell, since calling it a disease categorizes it as pathological, something to be cured. But these kinds of skilled human labor, especially caregiving, can’t be made to happen faster, or at scale, and so they do not get cheaper with time. Nor should they.


All of this makes it hard to understand the value of doing the work, and makes it easy to make decisions to scale back spending, since the best-case scenario for steady, reliable infrastructural systems, whether public or private, is that no one notices them.


In contrast, the financial benefits of routine inspection, maintenance, and renewal are diffuse—anyone directly involved might make a steady salary, but no one is likely to make a windfall profit. That societal bias toward making and novelty and away from caregiving and maintenance is reflected in who makes money and how.


A habitable planet, with a stable climate, is the infrastructure to our human-made infrastructure.


In 1856, Eunice Foote filled a glass cylinder with carbon dioxide and another with air, put them both in the sun, and measured their temperature. She became the first scientist to demonstrate that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.


Engineers and scientists have a term for when someone gets really, really upset at something that seems inconsequential—they call it “going nonlinear.”


But here’s the thing: even if I did stop flying, if everyone stopped flying, it’s not going to make much of a difference. It turns out that all air travel in total only accounts for a few percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of civil aviation is dwarfed by ground transportation and power generation.


Most of our total energy usage, and therefore the bulk of our emissions, is collective—industrial usage, food production, energy generation, and goods transportation. None of these are tractable to individual decisions about reducing our carbon footprint.


Reducing energy usage by doing less—not being with our friends and family, or otherwise reducing activities to use less power—is a tough sell. But to ask communities worldwide—both in the Global South and in underserved communities in otherwise wealthy, developed countries—to limit their energy usage, communities that may never have had access to these systems and the lives they enable, would be inequitable, bordering on unconscionable.


Our infrastructural networks, as designed, funnel resources to a fraction of humanity to allow them—and I’m part of this group, so I need to say “us”—to live lives of comfort and agency. They’re the most powerful means that humanity has ever devised to take care of each other at scale, to use energy and resources collectively. These systems are how we reduce the quotidian struggle to be a human, to have a material human body with material needs in a material world. In a more equitable world, more people, globally, would have access to the benefits provided by shared infrastructural systems. But that also means taking a hard look at the inequitable distribution of the associated harms, and figuring out how to limit rather than displace them.


But also: If we’re now thinking about replacing everything anyway, do we really want to do it the same way? Do we replace every gasoline-powered car with an electric car, or do we build out more public transit?


Deciding whether something is sustainable is deciding what consequences we’re willing to accept, when, and for whom.


If terraforming is taking an uninhabitable planet like Mars and changing the atmosphere to make an ecosystem capable of supporting life, we are instead taking our perfectly habitable planet and veneriforming it, transforming our terrestrial home into our other planetary next-door neighbor, suffocatingly hot Venus.


If weather systems become increasingly chaotic and extreme, and temperature increases mean that places where humans currently live become increasingly inimical to life, then what kind of infrastructural birthright are we leaving for our descendants? If we think about infrastructure as increasing our agency and the number of choices available to us, then abdicating our responsibility to leave them a world where they can live lives of peace and stability, with their basic needs cared for, is a failure of intergenerational empathy on a civilizational scale. Our current practices are unsustainable because they reduce the choices and agency available to coming generations.


Is it even possible—is there enough available renewable energy to power these vast systems? What technologies are needed? And there’s an even bigger question: How do we transform infrastructural systems at scale, collectively, while we are depending on them? It’s an enormous challenge, but it’s also an unprecedented opportunity. Not only is it a pathway to a sustainable future, but that future is one of energy abundance, not scarcity.


Rather than focusing on reducing our energy usage—a scarcity mindset—we instead can focus on increasing the amount of energy that comes from renewable sources. And we have a suite of emerging technologies that allow us to get energy without setting anything on fire, which means that for the first time in human history, it’s possible to entirely decouple energy usage from carbon emissions. If we put these together, we can realize that stabilizing the global climate doesn’t have to mean rationing or limiting energy usage, and it doesn’t have to mean sacrifice. Transitioning rapidly and completely into renewable, decarbonized sources of power is how humanity can access unprecedented energy abundance.


But the biggest concerns, by far, are the geopolitical issues and environmental costs associated with mining and refining the raw materials for batteries—not just lithium but also cobalt and even copper. All of these concerns will get a lot worse if production scales up without reconsidering how to handle extraction, disposal, and recycling, or developing alternative ways of storing energy.


batteries, as in electric cars. While batteries are heavier than gasoline or diesel, there’s some serious energy upside. Even


While batteries are heavier than gasoline or diesel, there’s some serious energy upside. Even the most efficient internal combustion engines in modern cars max out at less than 35 percent useful energy harvested from the heat produced by burning fuel, while converting electricity into motion is more like 75–80 percent efficient. Electric vehicles are so comparatively efficient that no matter where the electricity to charge the batteries comes from, even if it’s from coal-fired generating stations, they still use less energy and produce fewer emissions than conventional vehicles


It’s true that I can walk out any time of day or night, get into my car, and drive to nearly any point on the continent, as long as it isn’t rush hour and the point in question isn’t in downtown Boston. But this car-mediated level of agency is inaccessible to many people: it excludes people who are unable to drive safely because of age (which includes not just older people but children as well) or health, it requires the full and careful attention of a driver, and not only is owning a private vehicle exclusionary simply because it’s expensive, but even just firing up the engine means energy costs.


For all of human history, we’ve been living like energy is scarce and matter is infinite, when in fact the opposite is true: we need to learn to live like we have access to unlimited energy, but with the deep understanding that the atoms we have to work with are part of a closed system. Clean, abundant energy will open all kinds of new technological possibilities, but we’ll need a deep, society-wide rethink of our relationship to matter, to extraction, consumption, and waste.


By decoupling energy consumption from combustion, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced without giving up everything that access to energy enables. This doesn’t preclude investing in reduced power usage through efficiency, of course.


The idea of business as usual—extracting raw materials from the ground, turning them into products, and then dumping the waste as pollution—isn’t just politically challenging or morally reprehensible, it’s also fundamentally at odds with basic physics.


In the short term, planning for abundant energy and limited matter might mean conservation and adaptive reuse of existing infrastructure, as well as putting energy and resources into recovering materials or otherwise diverting them from the waste stream. In the medium term, that means continuing research into ways to recover or recycle materials. But in the longer term, we can put the opportunities of renewable energy directly to work on the challenges of limited materials.


Designing infrastructural systems for resilience rather than optimizing them for efficiency is an epistemological shift as much as anything else. It’s recognizing the uncertainty in the world and preparing to respond to it in a systemic way by committing the resources to create resilient systems. It means no longer using individual humans, especially the most vulnerable—their time, agency, safety, and health—as the slack in the system.


But avoiding lock-in—forgoing a further commitment to a now-undesirable system—is genuinely hard, because it’s what currently works best. It means pulling yourself out of the sticky entangled spider-web of the existing networks.


Every infrastructural system I’ve described in this book, whether public or private, exists because of specific decisions about the ultrastructure—who pays for what, who owns it, how it’s regulated, what negative externalities are permitted. Once it exists, it has the incumbent’s advantage.


Imagine if we decided that any infrastructural provision that’s noisy, noxious, or even just unsightly had to be built in the wealthiest neighborhoods. How would that change what we build? We know the answer to this: the harms would be mitigated.


The issues with infrastructure-for-profit become even more profound if we look toward what it will take to have functioning infrastructural systems for the next century or so. To begin with, no corporation has any interest in the well-being of our descendants twenty or fifty or a hundred years from now, even as potential customers, because the profit motive is fundamentally incompatible with long-term thinking.


Economists don’t agree on much, but there is a general consensus that public infrastructure investments can pay for themselves, because any debts that might result will be offset by the increase in economic capacity. This has always been the argument for public investment in infrastructure: what the people of a community or a country can do—and what companies can do and sell—is enabled, shaped, and limited by the nature and quality of the infrastructural services that are available. And that’s only the financial value of infrastructural investment. It doesn’t capture the enormous nonmonetary benefits of resilient, sustainable, equitable infrastructural provision. A similar calculation holds true for our response to climate change—the estimated cost of building out systems to transition away from fossil fuel consumption and to safeguard our communities will be much less than the cost of not doing so.


So there’s also an element of solidarity—of recognizing that we are all in sustained relationships with all the people who aren’t like us, because infrastructural systems are trans-scalar hyperobjects, with roots in the past and branches leading on toward our future.


Twelve millennia from now, the North Star will be bright Vega. All three are marked on the star map, making it into a clockface that tells the time within this twenty-six-thousand-year cycle of axial precession. It’s a message to the far future, to anyone here in this place and observing the remnants of the dam, even twenty millennia from now. Hansen’s art makes the Hoover Dam one of the few pieces of public infrastructure I know of that explicitly recognizes an impact on timescales that go far beyond a single human life. It’s an infrastructural facility not just as charismatic mega-engineering but as monument.


We expect our infrastructural systems to endure as well, to be there for us day after day, providing the technological bedrock of our lives. But instead of building out these facilities as monuments like the Hoover Dam, we have the opportunity to think of them as ecosystems, like forests. The exact nature of a forest is specific to the local conditions and resources, from the tropical forests of Borneo to the taiga of the subarctic.


This is our aspirational model for infrastructure. Like forests, our infrastructural systems now have the potential to be modular, networked, decentralized, responsive, and resilient. Instead of a few monumental installations, they could be distributed and locally specific. And above all, they can be sustainable, cradle-to-cradle systems, using energy inputs to create closed loops for materials rather than to dig linear cycles of extraction and waste ever deeper.


There’s a theory that the reason why we haven’t yet observed any signs of extraterrestrial life is because civilizations are faced with an existential choice: either learn to live sustainably, in harmony with their environment, or die. Being “loud”—sending lots of energy or matter wastefully out into space—is a signature of a linear economy. Sustainable societies are quiet.


As long as we have bodies, we’ll be in a sustained relationship with the people around us.


The decisions that we make about infrastructure today—the systems that we decide are “normal”—will in turn shape the lives and choices of people who are not yet born, our collective future.


This idea of being in an ongoing relationship with others simply by virtue of having bodies that exist in the world and which share common needs is what I think of as “infrastructural citizenship.”


Infrastructural citizenship is not just care at scale, but care in perpetuity.


Rawls’s test is this: What kind of society would you devise if you would not only have to live there, but you’d also have to pass through a “veil of ignorance”? That is, you wouldn’t know ahead of time what role you’d have in that society, or where you’d live, how wealthy you’d be, your ethnicity, gender, social status, or even what your idea of “the good life” might be.


What matters in infrastructural citizenship is where our bodies are today, the connections we have to those around us, and the impacts that the choices we make will have on the people who live where we are in the future.


As David Graeber wrote, “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”


But I don’t want to be as unusually and enormously privileged as I am—I want everyone to have my life, not in its exact details, but in what it makes possible. Because infrastructural citizenship is planetary. It might be rooted in home and neighborhood and community, but all human (and nonhuman) life on the planet is now entangled through these systems and, as with national citizenship and restrictive borders, there is no argument that can be made for why only some people deserve to have infrastructural systems that support basic needs.


All of these possibilities are manifestations of a bunker mindset, a denial of the web of mutuality that we’re all embedded in, at all scales. It’s a failure of social imagination, and it scares me. Because however they’re realized, whether literally or metaphorically, the size of a room or the size of a country, if atomized bunkers become the norm, it will become much harder to think and act collectively at all.


What wouldn’t be immediately visible to her is the way that I’m embedded in networks of mutual care. They are social, with my friends and family; professional, with my students and my colleagues; and civic, political, and economic. Each network includes people right next to me and people on the other side of the world. Even though the source of my water or the energy that powers my lights is invisible from inside my home, these infrastructural systems, with the technologies, organization, and enormous amount of human labor needed to keep them functioning, are also networks of mutual care in which I am inextricably bound.


Futures researcher Jamais Cascio has described a “pink collar future”—while other forms of human work and labor might be replaced by computers or technology, caregiving, which has historically been gendered, won’t be. Care is so dependent on context and on embodied, human interaction that it can’t easily be automated, made efficient, or optimized


No matter who you are, no matter where you are, no matter when you are—a hundred or a thousand years ago or as many years from now—our relationships with each other, and what we create together, won’t ever be replaced, mechanized, or automated away.
