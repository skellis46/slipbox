_previous note:_ [[Harris - Solitude]]

> If, however, these needs are fulfilled, a different picture emerges. . . . The fully developed (and very fortunate) human being working under the best conditions tends to be motivated by values which transcend his self. They are not selfish anymore in the old sense of that term. Beauty is not within one’s skin nor is justice or order. One can hardly class these desires as selfish in the sense that my desire for food might be. My satisfaction with achieving or allowing justice is not within my own skin; it does not lie along my arteries. It is equally outside and inside: therefore, it has transcended the geographical limitations of the self.6 - Maslow

> In his last major public seminar just a few months prior to his death, Maslow elaborated: “It’s quite clear that we are always suffering from this cloud that hangs over us, the fear of death. If you can transcend the fear of death, which is possible—if I could now assure you of a dignified death instead of an undignified one, of a gracious, reconciled, philosophical death . . . your life today, at this moment, would change. And the rest of your life would change. Every moment would change. I think we can teach this transcending of the ego.”9

> After listening to one particular lecture of Maslow’s, I now even count him as a friend. One evening, while sitting on my bed listening to a series of public lectures he gave at the Esalen Institute in 1969, I was struck by his answer to a question from an audience member: “How do you define the word ‘friendship’?”12 Maslow began by defining a friend as someone who is truly “need-gratifying” and whose needs you want to gratify in return. He then defined the friendship of lovers as one where each other’s needs melt into one, as the partner’s needs become your needs.

We are Practising friendship

> As Maslow said, “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”17

> No human being is exempt from the dire consequences of loneliness, and no other basic human need satisfaction can substitute for a deep connection—not money, not fame, not power, not popularity, not even belonging and acceptance—even though we often seek one or another of these other routes in the false hope that they will fully satisfy our need for connection. As Leo Braudy notes in his extensive review of the history of the quest for fame, the desire for fame is often based on a “dream of acceptance” that includes the notion that becoming famous will make the person feel loved, accepted, and sought after by others for the rest of their lives.52
- thinking about quest for vitality 

> in a well-known 1962 essay called “Love and Power” in Commentary magazine, the political scientist Hans Morgenthau argues that love and power are actually united in a common motive: the striving to escape loneliness. According to Morgenthau, power and love offer very different strategies for achieving the same goal: “Love is reunion through spontaneous mutuality, power seeks to create union through unilateral imposition.”

> Emma Seppälä, science director at the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at Stanford University.56 Seppälä continues:
> The way we are prioritizing our life, and what we are prioritizing, often goes against our greatest need for belonging. Whether it’s material goods or pleasures, financial advancement, or social advancement, we’re missing the point completely. We’re not seeing that our greatest happiness comes from connection, whether from family or religious or social community, something greater than yourself, something transcendental. We are so lost and there’s a reason why so many people feel lost and anxious and depressed and lonely.57


> Looking at all of this research, Rabbi Hyman Schachtel really seemed to be onto something when he said, “Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have.”


> It seems to me that the [fully functioning] individual moves toward being, knowingly and acceptingly, the process which he inwardly and actually is. . . . He is not trying to be more than he is, with the attendant feelings of insecurity or bombastic defensiveness. He is not trying to be less than he is, with the attendant feelings of guilt or self-deprecation. He is increasingly listening to the deepest recesses of his physiological and emotional being, and finds himself increasingly willing to be, with greater accuracy and depth, that self which he most truly is.
—Carl Rogers, On Becoming a Person: A Therapist’s View of Psychotherapy (1954)

> The findings dovetail nicely with Keltner’s definition of power as altering the states of others so as to make a difference in the world.81
Keltner, The power paradox.


SELF-WORTH
I like myself.
I am a worthwhile human being.
I am very comfortable with myself.
I am secure in my sense of self-worth.
I have enough respect for myself.
MASTERY
I am highly effective at the things I do.
I am almost always able to accomplish what I try for.
I perform very well at many things.
I often fulfill my goals.
I deal well with challenges in my life.

> Uncomfortable experiences are not necessarily bad, and protecting people from them shows a lack of respect for the integrity, nature, and future development of the person. 

> Maslow also received reports from self-actualizing people whom he knew as well as unsolicited letters from people who had learned of his new research. Soon, he had accumulated more subjective reports on the mystical experience than any other major psychologist since William James. Just as he had done with his self-actualization research, he used the reports and his wide reading of the literature to create “an impressionistic, ideal, ‘composite photograph’” of the “peak experience”—a term he settled on as less religious and more generalizable to the population at large.

> Reading William James eventually led Yaden to reading more modern experimental psychology and then to the neuroscience work of Andrew Newberg at Thomas Jefferson University. The creator of a new field—neurotheology—Newberg and his colleagues published the book Why God Won’t Go Away in 2001, in which they presented their findings on the neuroscience of spiritual experiences. From Tibetan monks to Franciscan nuns, Newberg scanned the brains of expert meditators who had encountered the same sort of intense feelings of unity that Yaden experienced. Newberg found that regardless of their religion or spiritual belief, the very same brain area was implicated—the superior parietal lobe, a region of the brain associated with spatial body awareness.22

> The researchers define transcendent experiences as “transient mental states marked by decreased self-salience and increased feelings of connectedness.” Further studies since Newberg’s earlier work have confirmed that people reporting mystical and out-of-body experiences show decreases in activation of the superior and inferior parietal lobe, as well as the nearby temporo-parietal junction—a cluster of brain regions that represent self-other boundaries and egocentric spatial awareness.25 As Yaden and his colleagues note, “This line of reasoning emphasizes how most fears and anxieties come from the prospect of damage to one’s physical or social self. Therefore, when the self temporarily disappears, so, too, may some of these fears and anxieties.”

> This conceptual graph was adapted from Yaden et al. (2017), “The Varieties of Self-Transcendent Experience.” It suggests a range of transcendent experiences with varying levels of connection with the world and is included for suggestive, demonstrative purposes. Further research is required to further flesh out this model.

> We may spend most of our waking hours advancing our own interests, but we all have the capacity to transcend self-interest and become simply a part of a whole. It’s not just a capacity; it’s the portal to many of life’s most cherished experiences.
—Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind (2012)

> However, in transcendent moments of self-loss, there is often a heightened sense of pure Being, and the experience often feels “realer than real.”37 William James referred to this as the “noetic” quality of the mystic experience.38 What’s more, the language associated with feelings of realness suggest a great connection with a larger whole, inclusiveness, and physical proximity—such as “all,” “everything,” “we,” and “close”—and the use of fewer first-person pronouns such as “I” and “my.”39 Healthy self-loss does not involve fear. Rather, it is characterized by curiosity and openness to the present moment and one’s inner experience.

> Healthy self-loss is akin to what Mark Leary refers to as the “hypoegoic” state of consciousness.40 According to Leary, people who are in a “hypoegoic state focus primarily on the present situation; introspect minimally on their thoughts, motives, and feelings; think about and evaluate themselves primarily in concrete, as opposed to abstract, ways; and pay relatively little attention to other people’s perceptions and evaluations of them.”41 The hypoegoic state is similar to the quiet ego (see Chapter 5). Having a substantial quieting of the ego is strongly related to having a strong, not weak, sense of self and with increased, not weakened, authenticity. Indeed, those with the quietest ego defenses often have the strongest sense of self. As the Buddhist Harvard psychotherapist Jack Engler put it, “You have to be somebody before you can be nobody.”42

> One of the most unifying transcendent experiences is a sense of awe. David Yaden told me that when he is giving lectures, he asks people to raise their hand if they have ever “felt at one with all things,” and only about one-third of the people in the audience raise their hands. He then asks people to raise their hands if they have “had a profound religious experience or awakening that changed the direction of their life.” Slightly more hands are typically raised. Finally, Yaden asks if anyone has ever “felt awe,” and nearly everyone’s hands shoot up. For this reason, Yaden refers to awe as “the everyperson’s spiritual experience.”

> While the concepts of awe and wonder have a long history in philosophy and religion, James and Maslow helped bring them to psychology. Today, much of the contemporary investigation of awe stems from a 2003 paper, “Approaching Awe, a Moral, Spiritual, and Aesthetic Emotion,” written by Dacher Keltner and Jonathan Haidt.47 The authors argued that there are two main cognitive appraisals that are central to awe experiences: the perception of vastness and the struggle to mentally process the experience. Vastness need not be perceptual, such as seeing the Grand Canyon, but can also be conceptual, such as contemplating eternity. Awe is an unusual and complex emotion because it mixes emotions that don’t tend to go with each other, such as ecstasy and fear.48 [@kaufman-2020-transcend Chapter 7 Peak Experiences n.pag.]

> Healthy transcendence is an emergent phenomenon resulting from the harmonious integration of one’s whole self in the service of cultivating the good society.

> Wisdom tends to increase with age and is most common among those with high levels of openness to experience, the capacity for self-examination and introspection, a motivation for personal growth, and the willingness to remain skeptical of one’s self-views, continually questioning assumptions and beliefs, and exploring and evaluating new information that is relevant to one’s identities.17

> This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life, and self-expression—and with all this yet to die.37

> There are indications that such transformations are possible for anyone who has the opportunity to repeatedly confront the ultimate unknown. Eric Weiner, author of The Geography of Bliss, visited Bhutan, a Buddhist kingdom well-known for its Gross National Happiness—a collective index used to measure the happiness and well-being of large swaths of its citizens. In Bhutan, death and gruesome images of death are openly confronted every day, and no one, not even children, is protected from the constant awareness of mortality.47 There are many ways to die in Bhutan, and elaborate, lengthy rituals are performed when someone does die. As Weiner was told by one of the inhabitants of Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, “You need to think about death for five minutes every day. . . . It will cure you. . . . It is this thing, this fear of death, this fear of dying before we have accomplished what we want or seen our children grow. This is what is troubling you.”48
> Recent research shows that even in the psychological laboratory, when given the opportunity to reflect more deeply and personally about their mortality over a sustained period of time, people tend to show a shift toward growth-oriented values—self-acceptance, intimacy, and community feeling—and away from extrinsic, status-oriented values such as money, image, and popularity.49 Three characteristics that seem to be especially predictive of growth after an extended period of death awareness are mindfulness, openness to experiences, and having a quiet ego,50 characteristics that are part and parcel of the B-realm of existence. Exploring your mortality with openness, curiosity, deep reflection, mindfulness, humility, and self-compassion helps you to move beyond the defenses that insecurity begets.51

> I was able to track down some of the B-exercises that Maslow was working on during the last few years of his life. I include some of them here in the hopes that they can further help you in your own journey of integration, wholeness, and transcendent experience. Feel free to return to these again and again, as they are timeless.

> Sample things.
> Keep your eye on the ends, not only on the means.
> Fight familiarization. Seek fresh experiences.
> Solve the Deficiency-problem (i.e., don’t always regard the Deficiency-realm as prepotent over the Being-realm).
> Get out of the Deficiency-world by deliberately going into the B-realm. Seek out art galleries, libraries, museums, beautiful or grand trees, and the mountains or seashore.
> Avoid dichotomizing the D-realm and the B-realm. They are (or should be) hierarchically integrated. An either/or choice is not necessary. The firmest foundation for the Being-realm is to have satisfied Deficiency-needs (such as for safety, connection, or self-esteem).
> Cultivate periods of quiet, meditation, “getting out of the world,” and getting out of our usual locality, immediate concerns, apprehensions, and forebodings. Periodically get away from time-and-space concerns, away from clocks, calendars, responsibilities, demands from the world, duties, and other people.
> Go into the dreamy state.
> Perceive the eternal, intrinsic laws of the cosmos. To accept or even love these laws is Taoistic and the essence of a good citizen of the universe.
> Embrace your past.
> Embrace your guilt rather than running from it.
> Be compassionate with yourself. Be understanding, accepting, forgiving, and perhaps even loving about your foibles as expressions of human nature. Enjoy and smile at yourself.
> Ask yourself: How would this situation look to a child? To the innocent? To a very old person who is beyond personal ambition and competition?
> Try to recover the sense of the miraculous about life. For example, a baby is a miracle. Think, for that baby now, “anything could happen” and “the sky is the limit.” Cultivate that sense of infinite possibility. The sense of admiration, awe, respect, and wonder.
> To better appreciate your own present life situation, compare yourself not with those seemingly luckier than you but rather with others less fortunate than you.
> You musn’t be ashamed to be good in a cynical world.
> Never underestimate the power of a single individual to affect the world. Remember, one candle in a cave lights everything.
> In order to regain authentic dignity and pride, try not concealing, not relying on external signs of validation (uniforms, medals, a cap and gown, labels, social roles). Show yourself as ultimately naked and self-revealing. Show your secret scars, shames, and guilts.
> Remember, it took one child in the fairy tale to say, “The Emperor has no clothes!” and then everyone saw it.
> Do not let anyone force roles on you. That is, do not act the way other people think that a doctor, minister, or teacher should act if it is not natural for you.
> Do not conceal your ignorance. Admit it.
> Engage in deliberate, experimental philanthropy. If sometimes you are no good for yourself (depressed, anxious), at least you can be good for someone else.
> If you find yourself becoming egoistic, arrogant, conceited, or puffed up, think of mortality. Or think of other arrogant and conceited people and see how they look. Do you want to look like that? Do you want to take yourself that seriously? To be that unhumorous?
> Contemplate people who are admirable, beautiful, lovable, or respectworthy.
> Try narrowed-down absorption or close-up fascination with the small world—for instance, the anthills, insects on the ground. Closely inspect flowers or blades of grass, grains of sand, or the earth. Watch intently without interfering.
> Use the artist’s or photographer’s trick of seeing the object in itself. For instance, frame it and thereby cut it away from its surroundings, away from your preconceptions, expectations, and theories of how it should look. Enlarge the object. Or squint at it so you see only general outlines. Or gaze at it from unexpected angles, such as upside down. Look at the object reflected in a mirror. Put it in unexpected backgrounds, in out-of-the-ordinary juxtapositions, or through unusual color filters. Gaze at it for a very long time. Gaze while free associating or daydreaming.
> Be with babies or children for a long period of time. They are closer to the Being-realm. Sometimes, you can experience the Being-realm in the presence of animals, like kittens, puppies, monkeys, or apes.
> Contemplate your life from a historian’s viewpoint—one hundred or even one thousand years in the future.
> Contemplate your life from the viewpoint of a nonhuman species—for example, as it might appear to ants.
> Imagine that you have only one year left to live.
> Contemplate your daily life as though being seen from a great distance, such as from a remote village in Africa.
> Look at a familiar person or situation as if viewing for the very first time.
> Look at the same person or situation as if viewing for the very last time; imagine, for instance, that the person is going to die before you see him or her again. Think as vividly as you can how you would feel, what you would truly lose, and about what you would be sorry. Would you have any regret or remorse? How would you conduct an effective good-bye to avoid later feeling a sense of gnawing incompleteness? And how would you best preserve your fullest memory of this person?
> Imagine yourself to be dying—or to be on the edge of execution. Then imagine how vivid and precious everything and everyone looks. Imagine vividly saying good-bye to each of the persons you love best. What would you say to each one? What would you do? How would you feel?
