# Dunagen, Fenton and Dorn - Modelling Improvisation as Emergence

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM summary: 

Dunagan, Fenton and Dorn frame dance improvisation not as a sequence of choices made by an individual mover but as an emergent system arising from interactions among bodies, environments, tasks and constraints. Drawing on complexity theory, dynamical systems and emergence, the chapter argues that improvisation cannot be adequately modelled through linear causality, intention or decision-making alone. Instead, improvisational movement is understood as self-organising: patterns arise spontaneously from local interactions without being planned in advance, and agency is distributed across dancer, context, score, sensory feedback and timing. Improvisation is thus less about inventing material and more about maintaining conditions in which novel organisation can arise.

The authors develop this argument through examples from practice and pedagogy, showing how constraints, scores and attentional strategies function not to limit creativity but to stabilise conditions for emergence. Importantly, they resist romantic notions of freedom or expressivity, insisting that improvisation is always structured, but structured in ways that are adaptive, nonlinear and contingent. This has implications for how improvisation is taught, analysed and evaluated: skill lies in sensing, modulating and staying responsive to emergent dynamics rather than controlling outcomes. The chapter positions improvisation as a paradigmatic case of embodied emergence, challenging subject-centred accounts of authorship and reinforcing a view of dance as a distributed, relational process rather than an expression of an autonomous self.
