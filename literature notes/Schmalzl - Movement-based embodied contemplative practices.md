#  Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices

_previous note:_ [[the enactive approach]]

Schmalzl, Mardi, Crane-Godreau and Payne discuss embodied cognition in relation to what they call movement-based embodied contemplative practices. The writing is an overview of the neuroscientific research on the mechanisms and effects of these practices. The authors say that their task is "one of translation—the translation of phenomena and theories emerging from one world-view into a language based on a very different world-view."[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.4]

> Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscience has witnessed a shift from predominantly abstract and computational views of the mind, to more embodied and situated views of the mind.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]

Schmalzl identifies Varela as one of first to introduce the term _embodied mind_ (p.1), and _enactive approach_:

> According to the “enactive approach” to cognition (Thompson and Varela, 2001; Thompson, 2005; Di Paolo and Thompson, 2014), living beings are autonomous agents that actively generate and maintain their physical and psychological identities, and that enact their cognitive domains through their activities. As such, the enactive approach postulates that human beings exists intrinsically as embodied beings, and that mental functions such as perception, cognition and motivation, cannot be fully understood without reference to the physical body as well as the environment in which they are experienced (Varela et al., 1991; Thompson, 2007).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]

- this enactive approach seems more or less the same as embodied cognition, but 'enaction' implies that it's only a part of [[4e cognition]]
- [[senses united by action]] (Tversky)

> Such practices involve putting oneself into a state of receptivity and surrendering to the spontaneous movement that arises. Overtly, these movements may resemble animal movements, Taijiquan forms, or Yoga asanas and mudras. In other cases however, the “movement” is purely internal, involving vivid interior sensations of heat, vibration, “energy” currents, and even changes in experienced bodily shape and spatial extension. During infant development, spontaneous involuntary movement precedes controlled voluntary movement and the development of a sense of agency (Sheets-Johnstone, 1999). That is, an infant’s experience of “movement occurs” precedes the experience of “I move” (Haselager et al., 2012). We suggest that MECPs involving spontaneous movement may therefore allow a constructive regression to early stages of development of voluntary motor control, and a consequent re-modeling of the sense of agency.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2]

- this is amazing -- "constructive regression", loosening sense of self. 


> So what needs to move, and to what extent does the movement need to be overtly evident, in order for a practice to qualify as movement- based? Here we propose the idea of extending the concept of “movement-based” so as to include very subtle, and even imag- ined, movement. This idea is supported by our knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying motor control (Scott, 2012) and motor imagery (Schuster et al., 2011).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2]

- obvious connection with Paxton's small dance.

> At this point it might appear that every contemplative practice involves movement to some extent, and in fact we would argue that this is the case. Even in the most static forms of seated meditation the whole body is in constant subtle motion with the rhythm of the breath. That said however, we pro- pose to define a movement-based practice as one in which the principal focus is on the intentional induction, or the intentional disinhibition, of overt movement or subtle internal sensations of movement. This definition excludes simply watching the breath while seated, unless specific emphasis is put on cultivating attention to the subtle movement that accompanies the breath.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.3]

> The DMN is known to be involved in the construction of the “autobiographical self,” and the assessment of stimuli for their relevance to the mentally sustained image of one-self. The altered activity of the DMN during meditative states has therefore been proposed to underlie a shift to less self-centered and more objective awareness of interoceptive as well as exteroceptive sensory events (Brewer et al., 2011). To which extent these finding also relate to MECPs remains an open question. Yoga and Qigong are broad and multifaceted categories, both including a range of “meditative movement” practices (Larkey et al., 2009), which are typically complemented by seated meditation techniques. Hence, while many of the already formulated theories about the mechanisms underlying traditional mindfulness-based practices might also apply to MECPs, it can also be assumed that MECPs may involve additional distinct mechanisms. Specifically, since movement increases the intensity of proprioceptive stimuli (Prochazka, 2011), it is possible that MECPs may offer a more efficient form of practice than seated meditation when it comes to cultivating bodily awareness and the sense of self.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.3]

- this default mode network is fascinating. Less self-centred! 

> Regardless of the specific underlying mechanisms, for most practitioners of MECPs contemplation represents the cultivation of sustained attention and equanimity (Desbordes et al., 2014), that for some has the ultimate aim of transforming habitual self- identity (akin to most seated meditation practices).
