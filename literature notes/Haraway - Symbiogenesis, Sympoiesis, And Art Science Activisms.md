# Haraway - Symbiogenesis, Sympoiesis, And Art Science Activisms For Staying With The Trouble

_previous note:_

> The core concept is material play, and the IFF proposes and enacts not think tanks or work tanks but play tanks, which I understand as arts for living on a damaged planet. The IFF and the Crochet Coral Reef are art science activisms, bringing people together to do string figures with math, sciences, and arts to make active attachments that might matter to resurgence in the Anthropocene and Capitalocene—that is, to make string figures in the Chthulucene.[@haraway-2017-symbiogenesis p.M38]

> Infecting each other and anyone who comes into contact with their fibrous critters, the thousands of crafters crochet psychological, material, and social attachments to biological reefs in the oceans, but not by practicing marine field biology, or by diving among the reefs, or by making some other direct contact. Rather, the crafters stitch “intimacy without proximity,” a presence without disturbing the critters that animate the project, but with the power to confront the exterminationist, trashy, greedy practices of global industrial economies and cultures.[@haraway-2017-symbiogenesis p.M39]

> The crochet reef is a practice of caring without the neediness of touching by camera or hand in yet another travelogue of discovery.[@haraway-2017-symbiogenesis p.M39]

> Critters are at stake in each other in every mixing and turning of the terran compost pile. We are compost, not posthuman; we inhabit the humusities, not the human-ities. Philosophically and materially, I am a compostist, not a post-humanist. Beings—human and not—become with each other, com-pose and decompose each other, in every scale and register of time and stuff in sympoietic tangling, in earthly worlding and unworlding. All of us must become more ontologically inventive and sensible within the bumptious holobiome that earth turns out to be, whether called Gaia or a Thousand Other Names.47 [@haraway-2017-symbiogenesis p.M45]
