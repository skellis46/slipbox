> This in turn is partly due to conservatism’s other flaw: its love affair with private property and the sovereign individual. Both of these things can be necessary bulwarks against the top-down collectivism of the left, but taken to extremes they lead to a top-down collectivism of another kind: oligarchic capitalism. That ‘conservatives’ have been the foremost defenders of this monstrosity, as it strips the world of all the things which they claim to hold dear, is the greatest hole beneath their waterline. It is the reason why the political factions which bear the name are now little more than mammon-worshipping business cabals, throwing out anti-woke red meat to the proles here and there to disguise the fact that all they really want to conserve is their money.

> Craig Calhoun’s drily-titled book *The Origins of Class Struggle* was published back in 1982, and despite its title it was not a Marxist tome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyhk0w538pmfsbb92x1tktn))


> Calhoun called these people ‘reactionary radicals.’ In his words, they were:
>  > *… movements of those who would fight against the coming of industrial society, who had traditional communities to preserve … This populism was radical; it rejected the very foundations on which capitalist society was being built in England.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyhkrkd7rkpfdwt0qd50a6b))


> Calhoun’s book is the story of the doomed resistance of the pre-industrial people of England to the destruction of their economies and associated ways of life. Accustomed as we are now to ‘work’ and ‘home’ and ‘consumption’ and ‘production’, it can be hard for us to understand that for most people in pre-modern times these amounted to the same thing. For an artisan weaver in pre-industrial England, for example, home was where the family lived and worked, where children were born and reared and trained, where trade was carried out, where food was grown and eaten. The process of breaking this apart into small segments – turning the home into a dormitory, its adult inhabitants into both ‘workers’ and ‘consumers’ elsewhere, its children into pupils at a distant school, its parlour into a show-room for TV, tablet and gaming console, its kitchen into a store-room of shop-bought processed ‘food’ – this was the work of the Machine.

> What the reactionary radicals were defending above all, says Calhoun, was the ‘moral economy.’ The moral economy was the polar opposite of the new ‘free market’ that was being built on the bones of old England and across the wider world. The free market commodified everything, from products to people, and sought to make that commodification global. The booming British empire, built as it was on the demolition of the moral economies of other nations and their absorption into a British-led new world order, was an exemplar of what was happening in England too. Empire, in this sense, was never a story of ‘the British’ imposing their ways onto ‘the colonies.’ It was a story of factory lords, big landowners and a newly-empowered capitalist class destroying the moral economies of communities from Lancashire to the Punjab, and forcing their all of their peoples into the new capitalist ‘workplace’ instead – where most of us remain to this day.

> Reactionary radicalism, then as now, is a defence of that moral economy – a system built around community bonds, empowered people, local economics and human-scale systems – in the face of colonisation by the Machine. That colonisation may come via gunboats or trade agreements, redcoats or giant superstores, enclosure acts or digital currencies, but it will always suck wealth out of place-based communities and funnel it to distant stockholders, just as it sucks the power away from local people and funnels it to national or international bodies whose interests align with those of the Machine. It will always replace people with technology, and it will always make consumers of us all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyjybvct680yekxkjgj9pcc))


> Technology, thought the Luddites, should be applied in a way which reinforced the moral economy rather than destroyed it. E. P. Thompson’s description of how the elite understood their demands might sound familiar to anyone who has heard today’s equivalents responding to the Machine-critical voices of our own time, or indeed to today’s disruptive populist movements: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyk021k59e21a7jdgjjzpzr))


> The reactionary radicals, says Calhoun, represented an ‘English populism that was not statist or supportive of reactionary elites, [but rather] a genuine and radical insurgency.’ It came from the people, stood for the people, and represented a defence of the moral economy against the Machine. Their contemporary equivalents do the same. Their stance is reactionary because it looks for guidance to the past, to an established - or lost - moral and economic order, hallowed by tradition, rather than seeking to build a new one based on an abstract ideology. But it is radical too, in its resistance to the alternative values of the Machine, and in its demand for justice for communities and a fair and balanced moral, social and economic order.

> The Marx-inflected left wants no truck with workers who resisted capitalism in order to defend traditional ways of life, because those traditional ways stink of ‘reaction’ and what Marx himself called ‘the idiocy of rural life.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyk6tfyfxywecgbj6kber4p))


> ideology is always the enemy of genuine, rooted culture. Real culture – human-scale culture – is messy. It cannot be labelled. The moral economy rarely makes rational sense. But it makes *human* sense; which is what matters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszwe3ph1pesxybp8kbdngfz))


> It is that any society worth having is always cored around what I call the ‘Three Ps’: *[people, place and prayer.](https://substack.com/redirect/707faed8-366b-471a-bf7d-4db9771b0412?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* Roots in your place, connection to your community, acknowledgement of the spiritual underpinning of all life. A Machine society, meanwhile, is cored instead around Three Ss: *[science, sex and the self.](https://substack.com/redirect/89a89795-2b79-487c-9bfd-f814cf85b48f?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* A reactionary radicalism, in this context, could be usefully defined as *an active attempt at creating, defending or restoring a moral economy cored around the three Ps.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszwfctafp4ycj85ewpgwr48))


> This, then, is my idea of an anti-Machine politics. A reactionary radicalism, its face set against Progress Theology, aiming instead towards a life based upon principles like these:
>  • Defending – or creating – a moral economy at the human scale.
>  • Rejecting liberal notions of ‘freedom’; refusing to be an atomised individual.
>  • Understanding the sacred nature of reality: materialism has failed us.
>  • Embracing family and home and place; loving the particular.
>  • Looking on all power with suspicion. Power + technology = tyranny. Resisting all distant tyranny. Make Politics Local Again.
>  • Rejecting abstract ideologies in favour of real-world responses.
>  • Understanding that material progress always comes at a price. What is the price for your phone, your car, your cheap clothing, your internet connection? Who pays it?
>  • Limiting your needs: more want equals more serfdom, for you and others.
>  • Strategically opposing any technology which threatens the moral economy.
>  • Loving God, neighbour and enemy – a bulwark against descending into tribalism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszwgy4j579atbcvdhbztrpb))
