# Jim Franks - Existential Bread

_previous note:_ [[Jensen - Baker's Year]]

> Love is not only the most important ingredient: it is the only ingredient which really matters.” —Tassajara Bread Book

> Bread is a fermented food that in an insane alchemical way is heated at the perfect moment to change flour that is virtually inedible into one of the most nutrient-dense and filling staple foods that humans have ever stumbled onto

> I could teach you how I make bread but that inherently rejects your circumstances your wants and needs and the wants and needs of the culture and communities that you wish to feed

> People like my bread cause it tastes good and it tastes good cause I like how I make it

> While sometimes I’m trying to find that line between community and being left the fuck alone I think it’s important to challenge ourselves to envision the world we want and work towards it in everything we do

> These are the most important ingredients Once you have them You can feed your culture

> Try to make the world a better place or at least a place with better bread

> You can’t inherently digest all the nutrients in the bran through consumption so eating whole grain things that aren’t fermented is just increasing fiber and not necessarily nutritional content

> When water is mixed with these proteins it forms gluten

> Flour almost exclusively is still roller milled and even if it’s labeled whole grain has been separated and reconstituted to approximate apocryphally the original content of the initial seed

> Higher ash content is more bran Higher extraction rate is more of the total grain

> The theory of gluten is that if these proteins are stressed and then allowed to relax that they will be able to stretch further and thus the structure of the bread is defined

> Falling numbers are the result of a test that helps identify the structural integrity of the starch chains Falling number measures the amount of pre-harvest sprouting that occurs in the grain while on the stalk in the field

> World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined Globally it is the leading source of vegetable proteins in human food What we usually think of as wheat is flour ground from the seed heads commonly called wheat berries

> Einkorn has a beautiful color on a spectrum of bright yellow to beige cause it’s rich in a carotenoid called lutein and more protein and fat than other forms of wheat It tastes when cooked like butter

> Where durum is grown in Italy they make a bread called Pane di Altamura that’s known for its fluffy open texture and its incredible keeping quality This is partly because of sourdough’s preservative quality but also because durum flour when baked actually seeps water as it ages so rather than staling

> Rye relies on something different to make fluffy bread called pentosans

> The Rye Baker

> Farro is actually an ethnobotanical term for three species of hulled wheat typically cooked as whole berries much like rice

> Farro piccolo is typically einkorn farro medio is typically emmer and farro grande is typically spelt

> The sugar that your yeast likes to consume is the sugar it makes by breaking down starch This sugar is called maltose

> What the fuck is porridge It’s just like oatmeal or any cooked cereal mixture I usually go with a 4:1 water to grain mix Bring to a simmer and cook until most of the water seems to be absorbed and it looks like something you want to eat

> Typically the weight of the porridge should be 10–30% in baker’s percentages

> Cooking the grain ahead of time and then mixing it into a dough allows the starches in the pre-cooked grain to gelatinize and hold more water adding moisture and structure to the bread during baking without making your initial dough overly hydrated

> Alternatively you can roast theses grains and flours before scalding them and making them into porridge Toasting oats on a baking sheet in the oven until brown then making oatmeal adds a rich crazy flavor reminiscent of turkey skin

> Things that are soaking will ferment which isn’t the biggest of deals especially because you should salt them slightly to adjust for taste and that will curb fermentation

> Beets and carrots create incredible unique sweet flavors in bread Supremely starchy vegetables like potatoes and squash make great bread additions because they act like porridge infusing extra moisture as the bread develops

> I typically roast these vegetables with oil and salt then puree them before adding them into the dough

> Bananas are really interesting in baking because they act like a 1:1 replacement for butter and sugar and flour and eggs

> Making a starter is so simple you’ll probably screw it up because you want it to mean more than it does just like your first relationship

> The bacteria and yeast on your skin and in your environment are incredibly unique and will be different no matter what you do so don’t get too caught up trying to create the perfect blend It’s nature it’s a mess it’s already perfect

> Durum starters do very well being refrigerated They’re great for long periods of time at cold temperatures with very low hydration often referred to as pasta madre

> Some people like dense stuff Some people like chewy things Some like soft open custardy bread and everything you do in terms of development or touching the dough is a decision in this direction

> if you’re reading this book and believing anything I say you’re using nice grain from local farms grain that someone pet a deer near and if that’s the case you don’t have to worry about fava bean dilution and reduced enzymatic activity

> The thing is a book is the worst way to learn this Shaping is mostly finesse otherwise known as ineffable bullshit I can’t teach you this you need to teach yourself

> Take a long deep breath you’re halfway through It’s gonna be bread It’s gonna be okay and even if it’s not okay that will be okay

> But making great bread is possible It takes time It takes respect It takes love It’s not something that’s ever really done but anyone can do it The reason that I make bread that people love is that I truly love making bread
