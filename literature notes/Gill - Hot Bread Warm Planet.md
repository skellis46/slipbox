# Hot Bread, Warm Planet by Graison Gill from Sourdough Madrigals

> Wheat, the most widely grown crop on the planet, accounts for 1 out of every 5 calories consumed across the world. And the white flour made from it is treated by bakers and eaters alike as a product. But I’ve spent my career saying that flour is an ingredient. (I’m pretty sure it’s why I was a James Beard Finalist in 2020). I believe this not just from a culinary perspective: fresh, whole grain flour is deliciously alive and encourages bakers to respond creatively. But also from an ecological perspective–the self-stable, tasteless, colorless, anemic white flour we’re all used to is killing our bodies and the planet.

> So we’re committing three fatal acts when we’re buying and baking with white flour: we’re throwing out whole food to make refined food, we’re using more energy to transform whole grains into white flour, and we’re using more land and resources to compensate for this waste by growing more wheat we don’t need. All of this for a [product](https://substack.com/redirect/658fe99e-c785-4b51-bdd2-faa559e8a7a5?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) which is making us, and in turn the planet, sicker with the cocktail of modern plagues: diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and colo-rectal cancer.

> Value is the most neglected topic in the climate change and food discussion. Most people in the Western world do not balk at spending $18 on a cocktail, $6.50 on an oat milk latte, $15 on a glass of wine, or $9 on a pint of “craft” beer. Yet, if an artisan baker dares to charge $12 for a loaf of wholegrain, sourdough bread those same customers raise eyebrows and pinch pennies. This–despite the fact that none of the above things–require a fraction of the skill, labor, or technique it takes to make healthy and delicious bread. For whatever reason, right or wrong, most food consumers place a higher value on everything except bread.
