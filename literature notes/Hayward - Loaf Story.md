# Tim Hayward - Loaf Story a Love-Letter to Bread, With Recipes

_previous note:_ [[Pollan - In Defence of Food]]

> The problem is that although, compared with mass-produced bread, bro bread is ‘full of character’, it has no local cultural relevance and, as my friend insisted with increasing frustration, it distracts bakers from the local breads that do.

> Wheat for flour was one of the first crops we grew collectively.

> Bread production and the elements of the process that must be undertaken collectively are at the roots of our communities, our nationalities, our cultures and even our politics… but what bread has never been is a solitary art.

> Today, Cancer Research UK states on its website that ‘for most cancer types, there is no link between acrylamide and cancer risk’.

> Tomás Graves’ amazing book Bread & Oil (2000)

> I find three anchovies, dressed in their own oil, on a slice of fresh white sourdough with a few additional crumbs of salt and perhaps a couple of drops of sherry vinegar a superlative snack, but I’m then left with the rest of the jar to deal with. I chill the remaining anchovies in their oil until it solidifies, then weigh the resulting mixture. I add twice the amount of fridge-cold butter, a little Espelette pepper and the merest scraping of lemon zest and then blitz the lot in a small spice blender. The resulting anchovy butter gets rolled in a piece of greaseproof paper and frozen – leaving no problematic, smelly leftovers in the fridge, but providing me with a sort of fragrant candle of solid butter from which I can crack a chunk in the morning and allow it to melt over my hot toast.

> I’ve ‘baked’ beans in pressure cookers, in sous vide baths and crock pots and they’ve all been delicious, but the terrible truth is that none of them were tinned Heinz baked beans. I know, you’re expecting the standard disclaimer that ‘other brands of sauced bean are available’, but c’mon. We know the truth. Heinz beans are sui generis, entirely and utterly a thing on their own. They have the same relationship to any homemade beans that tinned peaches do to fresh ones. They are the same at a genetic level, but as different as you can possibly imagine in real life.

> In medieval England it was common to float a piece of spiced toast in hot wine to create a sort of damp tapa and it’s possible that the word ‘toast’, meaning a blessing or compliment paid over a raised glass, refers back to this practice.

> To understand matpakke, you first need to understand a little about lagom. In Sweden, lagom famously refers to a profound belief, at a culture-wide level, in the notion of ‘sufficiency’ – the correct or adequate amount – leading to a pursuit of balance and moderation in everything. In Norwegian, lagom has a subtly different meaning of ‘fitting’, ‘proper’ and ‘reasonable’ – perhaps a more moral interpretation.

> In 1982 the milling company Molini Adriesi, in Verona, invent the ciabatta loaf.23 Made with an extremely wet dough, it creates a light, soft-crust loaf that’s the perfect size for a couple of single-serving sandwiches. It also toasts superbly.

> Shokupan, or the slightly sweeter version called Hokkaido milk bread, is the favourite sandwich loaf of Japan (we saw it earlier in the tamago sando). It’s made in a similar way to regular white bread but enriched with an egg and powdered milk. Though it uses yeast, it’s based on a tangzhong, a sort of cooked roux. It’s an unfamiliar process to most western bread makers, but it creates a dough that can hold a lot of gas during cooking, becoming fluffy without getting chewy.
