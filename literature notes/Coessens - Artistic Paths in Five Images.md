# Coessens - Artistic Paths in Five Images: Questioning Artistic Research

_previous note:_

- Chapter in book by Huber et al.
- p.52 explores etymology of 'method': meta and hodos

> Meta hodos is the etymological background of method, meta meaning ‘half, over, beyond’, but also ‘higher, transcending’, and hodos referring to a journey, a way of doing, a path. A path is something created by way of a sys  tematic practice. It has a goal – moving from one point to another – and is a path only because many walkers use it.[@coessens-2021-artistic p.52]
- p.53 uses five metaphorical images to explore Artistic Research
	- 1. p.53 bread making
	- 2. p.54 hammering 
	- 3. p.56 the game
	- 4. p.57 mirrors
	- 5. p.59 insight - outside

- Coessens writing about the experience of one's body in a mirrored room got me thinking about [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]
