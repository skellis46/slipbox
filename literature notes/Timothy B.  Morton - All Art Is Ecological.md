## Highlights

> The inner logic of the smoothly functioning system – right up until the moment at which it wasn’t smoothly functioning, aka now – consists of logical axioms that have to do with survival no matter what. Existence no matter what. Existing overriding any quality of existing – human existing that is, and to hell with the lifeforms that aren’t our cattle (a term from which we get chattels, as in women in many forms of patriarchy, and the root of the word capital). Existence above and beyond qualities. This supremacy of existing is a default ontology and a default utilitarianism, and before any of it was philosophically formalized, it was built into social space, which now means pretty much the entire surface of Earth.

> We confront a blank-seeming wall in every dimension of our experience – social space, psychic space, philosophy space. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=462))


> Because strangely, this feeling of openness, this uncanny sensation of finding ourselves somewhere and not recognizing it, is exactly a glimpse of living less definitively, in a world comprised almost entirely not of ourselves. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=465))


> But awareness of the sensuous existence of other life-forms doesn’t have to involve big ideas or actions. How about just visiting your local garden centre to smell the plants? ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=475))


> Why this constant and very particular orientation to the future – what needs ‘to be done’ in order to start being ecological? It’s a sort of gravity well that ecological thought about ethics and politics can get stuck in. You think future and you think radically different from the present. You think I need to change my mindset, now, then I can really start making a difference. You are thinking along the lines of agricultural religion, which is designed mostly to keep agricultural hierarchies in place. You are trying to get the right attitude towards some transcendent principle; in other words, you are operating within the language of good and evil, guilt and redemption. Agricultural religion (Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism and so on) is implicitly hierarchical: there’s a top tier and a bottom one, and the very word hierarchy means the rule of the priests. By framing ecological action this way, you have been sucked into a gravity well, and it’s not an especially ecological space down there. In many ways, it’s not helping at all. For instance, there’s really no reason to feel individual guilt: your individual actions are statistically meaningless.

> Nonviolence in this respect is uneasy and shifting. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=517))


> The trouble is that rights and citizenship and subject-hood (and languages related to those concepts) have to do with possessing things. Individual rights are based on property rights, so that being in possession of yourself is one criterion for having them, for example. But if everything has rights, nothing can be property, so nothing can have rights. It’s as simple as that. Scaled up to Earth magnitude, rights language doesn’t work at all. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=534))


> We can start to break through this difficult impasse by noting that what is called environment is just lifeforms and their extended genomic expressions: think of spider’s webs and beaver’s dams. When you think this way, you are already thinking about wholes and parts in a different way. And when you think of things like that, there’s really no difference between thinking about what is called an ecosystem and what is called a single lifeform. Problem solved. ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=569))


> Thinking about wholes and parts in this way is a key component of good old-fashioned art appreciation theory. A work of art is a whole, and this whole contains many parts – the materials out of which it’s made being just one of them. We could include the interprective horizons of the art’s consumers, for example, and the contexts in which the art materials were assembled – a highly explosive concept, as we saw earlier. In this way it’s obvious that there are so many more parts than there is whole. In an age of ecological awareness there is no one scale to rule them all. This means that art and art appreciation won’t stay still, in the way that a lot of art theory (for instance in Kant) wants. And in the absence of a single authoritative (anthropocentric) standard of taste with which to judge art, how we regard it is also about how wholes are always less than the sums of their parts. A work of art is like a transparent bag full of eyes, and each eye is also a transparent bag full of eyes. There is something inherently weird, even disgusting, about beauty itself, and this weirdness gets mixed back in when we consider things in an ecological way. This is because beauty just happens, without our ego cooking it up. The experience of beauty itself is an entity that isn’t ‘me’. This means that the experience has an intrinsic weirdness to it. This is why other people’s taste might come across as bizarre or kitschy. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=572))


> The idea that we’re outside the world looking in, deciding from a menu which choice to make, is precisely the dangerous illusion. ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=590))


> And the ice was accessing us. It seemed to send out waves of cold, or suck our heat, whichever way around. This kind of access was how Eliasson was thinking about it – the encounter with Ice Watch is in a way a dialogue with ice blocks, not a one-way human conversation in a mirror that happens to be made of ice. We’ve been having that kind of conversation with nonhuman things for thousands of years. It’s exactly the reason we are in this mess called global warming. ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=640))


> The aesthetic experience isn’t really about data – it’s about data-ness, the qualities we experience when we apprehend something. (As I mentioned earlier, data just means ‘what is given’, and isn’t only about numbers and pie charts.) The aesthetic experience is about solidarity with what is given. It’s a solidarity, a feeling of alreadiness, for no reason in particular, with no agenda in particular – like evolution, like the biosphere. There is no good reason to distinguish between nonhumans that are ‘natural’ and ones that are ‘artificial’, by which we mean made by humans. It just becomes too difficult to sustain such distinctions. Since, therefore, an artwork is itself a nonhuman being, this solidarity in the artistic realm is already solidarity with nonhumans, whether or not art is explicitly ecological. Ecologically explicit art is simply art that brings this solidarity with the nonhuman to the foreground. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=648))


> In the beauty experience, there is some kind of mind-meld-like thing that takes place, where I can’t tell whether it’s me or the artwork that is causing the beauty experience: if I try to reduce it to the artwork or to me, I pretty much ruin it. This means, argues Kant, that the beauty experience is like the operating system on top of which all kinds of cool political apps are sitting, apps such as democracy. Nonviolently coexisting with a being that isn’t you is a pretty good basis for that. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=658))


> So designers should be careful what they design. Maybe they need to think at least on a number of different temporal scales when they design something. A plastic bag isn’t just for humans. It’s for seagulls to choke on, and now we can see that thanks to photographers such as Chris Jordan who photographs beings who get caught in the Pacific Garbage Vortex. A Styrofoam cup isn’t just for coffee, it’s for slowly being digested by soil bacteria for five hundred years. A nuclear device isn’t just for your enemy. It’s for beings 24,000 years from now. This Diet Coke isn’t just for me. It’s for my teeth and my stomach bacteria, and the latter may get slaughtered by the acids in there. This is why I created the concept of the hyperobject in my book The Ecological Thought. A hyperobject is a thing so vast in both temporal and spatial terms that we can only see slices of it at a time; hyperobjects come in and out of phase with human time; they end up ‘contaminating’ everything, if we find ourselves inside them (I call this phenomenon viscosity). Imagine all the plastic bags in existence at all: all of them, all that will ever exist, every-where. This heap of plastic bags is a hyperobject: it’s an entity that is massively distributed in space and time in such a way that you obviously can only access small slices of it at a time, and in such a way that obviously transcends merely human access modes and scales.

> Realizing that there are lots of different temporality formats is basically what ecological awareness is. It’s equivalent to acknowledging in a deep way the existence of beings that aren’t you, with whom you coexist. Once you’ve done that, you can’t un-acknowledge it. There’s no going back. ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=736))


> The ice chunk is a sort of train station in which past and future are sliding past one another, not touching, and what I mistakenly call present is a kind of relative motion between the two sliding trains of past and future. I call it nowness to differentiate it from a reified atomic ‘present’ that actually I don’t think truly exists. ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=782))


> The subscendent nature of art means that ecological art that calls itself as such can’t be about Sierra Club-style uplifting poster-type grandeur. It must include ugliness and disgust, and haunting weirdness, and a sense of unreality as much as of reality. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=873))


> Once we start embracing difference not as rigid separation but as uncanny affinity, as I’ve been suggesting, we see that humans are more like nonhumans, and nonhumans are more like humans, than we like to think – and those two phrases do not quite add up. It is radically undecidable whether we are reducible to nonsentient, nonconscious, nonperson status – or whether things that aren’t us, such as foxes or teacups, are reducible upwards to conventional personhood. ([Location 881](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=881))


> Everyone gets conned by objectification, except for me, the one who writes the sentence Everyone gets conned by objectification. All sentences are ideological, except for the sentence All sentences are ideological. Can you see how this works? ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=941))


> To want to cleanse a building of what is taken to be a supplementary stain is to assume that a thing underlies its appearance, the old default substance ontology. To allow things to get dirty is to allow that things are not at war with time. ([Location 971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=971))


> The real feeling of experiencing what we sometimes call beauty is neither about our putting a label on to things, nor of our being absolutely inert. Instead it’s like finding something in me that isn’t me: there is a feeling in my inner space that I didn’t cook up myself, and it seems to be sent to me from this ‘object’ over there on the gallery wall, but when I try to find out exactly where this feeling is and what it is about the thing, or about me, that is the reason why I’m having this feeling, I can’t isolate it without ruining what precisely is beautiful about it. ([Location 1021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=1021))


> When you think about it like this, you can see why being able to appreciate ambiguity is at the basis of being ecological. And do you know what this means? Your indifference to ecological things is exactly the sort of place where you will find the right kind of ecological feeling. This is one big reason why deleting the indifference too aggressively and too fast, by being preachy, doesn’t help at all. You don’t know why you should care: isn’t that what we are all feeling when we experience something beautiful? How come this chord sequence is making tears run down my face? ([Location 1030](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=1030))


> You have an idea that there is an inside and an outside of yourself, and perhaps this is the deepest way in which you start to think that being ecological involves some massive change. ([Location 1113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08YRR71J1&location=1113))


> But you are already a symbiotic being entangled with other symbiotic beings. The problem with ecological awareness and action isn’t that it’s horribly difficult. It’s that it’s too easy. You are breathing air, your bacterial microbiome is humming away, evolution is silently unfolding in the background. Somewhere, a bird is singing and clouds pass overhead. You stop reading this book and look around you. You don’t have to be ecological. Because you are ecological.
