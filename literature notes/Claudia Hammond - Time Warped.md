> Edmund Husserl said in his study of the phenomenology of time, we hear a song one note at a time, but it is our sense of the future and the past – our memory and our anticipation – that makes it a song. ([Location 211](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=211))

> St Augustine wrote ‘What then is time? If no one asks me, then I know. If I wish to explain it to someone who asks, I know it not.’ Yet we constantly refer to abstract ideas involving time – six months, last week or next year – and everyone knows what we mean. The notion of time is both personal and shared. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=213))

> Routines give us a sense of security. They are so important that the mere act of breaking them can disrupt a person’s concept of time and, in extreme cases, even cause terror. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=225))

> If we look at pictures of serene faces we are quite good at guessing how long we watched them for, but show us a series of frightened faces and we overestimate the time that passed. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=303))

> It also comes up a lot in experiments on how long a ‘moment’ might last. In the eleventh book of his confessions, St Augustine declared that the past and the future are mental constructions that we can only see through ‘a window of presence’. A long line of researchers have tried to work out how long this ‘now’ or ‘moment’ might last. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=842))

> Follow-up questions included: if the spot in front of you represents lunch, where do breakfast and dinner go, and if that same spot is September where would August and October go? She found that Mandarin speakers, whether living in Taiwan or California, were eight times more likely than English speakers to lay time out vertically, usually pointing up into the air for earlier events and down for later ones.

> But Alan had the same determination shared by the psychiatrist Victor Frankl during his time in Nazi concentration camps – that his captors could control everything else, but not his thoughts. He resolved to take charge of his own mental state. ([Location 1507](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=1507))

> On average people think about the future 59 times a day or once every 16 minutes during waking hours.77 Indeed research in this field reveals a staggering finding: contemplating the future could be the brain’s default mode of operation. But this is not wasteful daydreaming or, as the phrase goes, a case of ‘wishing our lives away’. Mental time-travel into the future matters – and is useful. It affects our judgements, our emotional states and the decisions we make, sometimes for the worse. And my explorations of future thinking will also reveal something rather surprising about the reasons for the fallibility of our memories of the past.

> If you take the example of a job interview, there’s the mental rehearsal of the questions beforehand, followed afterwards by the agonising, repeated replaying of the worst moments, coupled with the imagination of a possible past, of the things you wished you’d said. These were possible futures. Now they are part of an impossible past. ([Location 2400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=2400))

> A few found these images comforting, despite their graphic nature, but for others they were distressing. This is what one woman imagined when she was planning to jump off the top of a five-storey house. ‘I hit the road and the concrete. I imagine my brain splitting open like a pumpkin, seeing myself doing that, seeing myself flying down, hair and clothes flying backwards, head breaking into pieces, making a sound like a watermelon, a pop sound. The traffic stops and people scream, my mother comes out screaming, mother is crying, father is in shock, face so shattered that it is unrecognisable.’ This graphic image haunted her. Some said these imaginings took over their lives. Research on future thinking suggests that these images could have serious consequences. There is plenty of evidence that once you have imagined yourself doing something in the future, whether voting ([Location 2667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=2667))

> Our inclination is to pitch ourselves forward in time. We take our ability to imagine the future for granted, barely even considering it to be a skill, yet this imaginative construction process has been described as being near the ‘apex of human intellectual abilities’.103 ([Location 2713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B007BLOFS4&location=2713))

> If people are asked to describe an imaginary car accident which happened in the past tense, they do so in far more detail than if they’re asked to describe an equally imaginary accident in the future tense.

> Philip Zimbardo conducted an experiment that coincidentally focused on painting. A group of people were asked to paint a picture of a basket of flowers. Half were told the painting would be judged afterwards by graduates from the art department. The other half were to concentrate on the creative process itself and not to worry about the final product. When the art graduates judged the paintings they rated the second group’s more highly, despite the fact that they weren’t focusing on the results.136 This suggests that this state of mind might not only keep you in the present but has benefits for creativity too.
