#  Sheets-Johnstone - Why Is Movement Therapeutic?

_previous note:_ [[self is a complex interplay of brain, body and environment]]

Sheets-Johnstone states that her first provisional answer to the question of her essay is that movement is "life-proclaiming"[@sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.3]. Her second answer is that movement validates and expresses an 'I' in terms of agency and capability (as opposed to an 'I' as sense of self.)
