> Darkness and concealment are the dominant characteristic of the primordial time. All life first becomes and develops in the night; for this reason, the ancients called night the fertile mother of things and indeed, together with chaos, the oldest of beings.

> Melanie Klein, the psychoanalyst, tried to imagine our beginning harder than most, tried to picture the start of our selves, the prehistory of ‘I’. She filled it with monsters. Neither self nor not-self, just – shit rage tits fear cock milk envy – an unholy conglomeration of parts and forces, like those foetus-like tumuors made of teeth and hair.

> The scientists and analysts can only hint, guess or romanticize, but they seem to agree on this: that beneath the present coherence lies a time of chaos. Our sense of continuity, this coherence we rarely have cause to question, let alone notice, had to be formed, order had to be imposed, coherence grown, sense made. There was no ‘I’ to do it, because the ‘I’ was the result. At some point the ‘I’ that is you and me began to form the living breathing world that we now inhabit, at some point this world began to form an ‘I’. This strange reciprocity gave rise to us. What tumultuous energies must we have struggled to harness and tame, with what hideous strength did we bind and form those primal forces that also were us, hauling ourselves by the bootstraps up and out of the maelstrom into the beginnings of coherence and order? Into beginning. How do we begin? Where do we start? ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M9TGP90&location=250))

> Those primal forces that made up the climate of our individual pre-dawn life, when the ‘I’ was without form and void, those forces achieved form through a consistent repetition, through establishing and maintaining routines. The word ‘routine’ derives from ‘route’, itself deriving from ‘rupta via’, meaning a road forged by force, ([Location 258](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00M9TGP90&location=258))

> Keep doing the same thing and eventually it makes a way, establishes a form with consistency, shape and coherence. A path is made and ‘I’ begins. From the impersonal forces, from the ‘It’, an ‘I’ begins to form. In learning to drive, walk, see or talk, in our very being, we are a massive interpenetrating collection of paths and routines worn by repetition; we are each a landscape, shaped by recurring patterns of force and formed by desire.

> She lay late in bed, refusing the coffee and fried eggs which the friendly Irish servants thrust through her door, and hating the intimate domestic noises of the house and the cries and rumblings of the street. Her week of idleness had brought home to her with exaggerated force those small aggravations of the boarding-house world, and she yearned for that other luxurious world, whose machinery is so carefully concealed that one scene flows into another without perceptible agency.

It is in the addition that the healing lies, the sufficient accumulation of new experience to balance the weight of the old, to give you new routines, new things to do, and other notions, other things to think about it.

> The spreading of the load of ourselves into the environment is the subject of a new wave of psychological research and theory, sometimes known as 4E cognition. These four Es are embodied, embedded, extended and enacted.
