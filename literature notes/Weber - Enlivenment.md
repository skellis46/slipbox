# Weber - Enlivenment

_previous note:_

## Introduction

- view all beings in "common household of matter, desire, and imagination" - he call this perspective enlivenment [@weber-2019-enlivenment p.1], also "enlightenment 2.0" [@weber-2019-enlivenment p.25]
- self is self-through-other (p.2)
- anthropocene as assertion of humans asserting mastery (p.2), in which nature is "hopelessly under human control" (p.9) Weber's proposal is to:

> understand the identity of humans and nature through a commons of creative transformation that underlies all reality and finds a particularly forceful expression in life.[@weber-2019-enlivenment p.3]

- fundamental dimension of existence already shared which is aliveness; a "desire to connect through touch and body in order to create fertile communities of mutual flourishing" (p.3)
- mentions eco-philosopher [Gary Snyder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Snyder)
- uses term _commons_ to mean relationships of reciprocity and mutual co-creation (p.4) ^f00e6f
- commons does not distinguish between users and objects (p.5)

> Commons are about protecting aliveness through participation and reciprocity. They are a way of imagining our ecological role by giving the ecosystem more life.[@weber-2019-enlivenment pp.5-6] ^5704ea

- Anthropocene "approach" as just another form of domestication (p.7)
- neoliberal market system (separation of resources (which are traded) and subjects (who trade them) as product of Enlightenment (p.7)
- relationship processes unfold and are conveyed through meaning, and meaning is experienced (by animals, humans, plants, etc) through emotions.(p.8)
- to become more individual through connections (p.9)
- new materialism as dualistic split by "imbuing nonhuman beings and even things with agency" (p.10)


> Life can never be just a resource; it is always also a gift received by the other members of the ecosystem whose contributions are necessary for a living subject to survive.[@weber-2019-enlivenment p.45]
