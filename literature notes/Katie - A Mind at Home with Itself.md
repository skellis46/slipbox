# Katie - A Mind at Home with Itself

_previous note:_ [[zen, map and territory]]

>When you believe a thought that argues with reality, you’re confused. When you question that thought and see that it’s not true, you’re enlightened to it, you’re liberated from it. You’re as free as the Buddha in that moment. And then the next stressful thought comes along, and you either believe it or question it. It’s your next opportunity to get enlightened. Life is as simple as that.

The Work consists of four questions and what she calls a turnaround, which is a way of experiencing the opposite of what you believe. The questions are:

1. Is it true?

2. Can you absolutely know that it’s true?

3. How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?

4. Who would you be without the thought?


## 2. bowing to a grain of sand

But the mind can never be controlled; it can only be questioned, loved, and met with understanding.

We can control the mind only to this extent: as a thought appears, we can simply notice it, without believing it. We can notice it with a questioning mind. The thought that asserts itself and wants to be believed comes from the I-know mind, the supposed teacher. The questioning comes purely from the student. In the questioning mind we experience a flow. There’s no interruption, no limitation. ”Control” is just a matter of noticing. It doesn’t mean imposing an order onto the mind. If you’re a true student, the thought will always end with a question mark.

The grain of sand gives itself entirely. Even though I may be totally unaware of it, it waits for the opportunity to show me itself and how it exists through me. It’s patient, solid in its purpose, unchanging in its present identity; it doesn’t pretend; it doesn’t mind if I step on it, praise it, or belittle it; it remains what it is, without disguise or deceit; it is perfectly allowing, doesn’t resist the name I give it, lets itself be whatever I call it. Who of right mind wouldn’t bow to such a consciousness? I honor it as a teacher, and I meet its nature in everything I witness. If you throw me away, step on me, judge me as useless, overlook me, do I remain with the same constant, generous nature as the grain of sand? This is the Buddha-mind. 

What’s the difference between humility and humiliation?
Humility looks very ordinary. It’s hello and goodbye. Sometimes, at first, it looks like tears; sometimes, like dying. It’s total surrender. The thing you were so proud of is seen as selfish; you treasured it, and it falls apart, and there is a change that takes place within you. If there’s any hint of humiliation, it means that your ego hasn’t yet surrendered; if you feel humbled, it means that your ego is surrendered, and it’s the softest, most lovely feeling, and in that experience you see everyone as your teacher. You stand in what’s left of you, and you die, and you keep dying. It’s like the tree that lets go of its leaves. That beautiful clothing has fallen away, and the tree just stands there in the cold of winter, totally exposed.

You say that to you there are no students; there are only friends. Don’t you consider yourself a teacher?
I am always the student. I love to be in that position, bowing, listening, at the feet of all that I see. This doesn’t require an open mind: it is the open mind. It never has to take responsibility for knowing or for not knowing. It receives everything without defense, without judgment, since judgment would cost it everything it is. The moment you think you’re someone or think you have something to teach, the inner world freezes and becomes the realm of illusion. That’s what it costs when you identify yourself as the person who knows. It’s a concoction of mind. You shrink down into the teacher: limited, separate, stuck.

If you think that someone else is the cause of your problem, you’re insane.

## 3.  THE RADIANT MOMENT

The only important thing to know is this: if a thought hurts, question it.

## 4. GIVING IS RECEIVING

True generosity happens without any awareness of being generous. You just give. That’s it. Nothing sticks to the action. It’s an act of receiving as much as of giving. The giving is the receiving. And it’s not that bodhisattvas shouldn’t attach to the concept that they are acting generously; it’s that they don’t. It’s nothing they have to monitor or strive for. When you’re being generous and giving something with your whole heart, you’re simply not aware of any generosity. You’re not self-conscious. In fact, you would laugh if someone called you generous; it would seem ridiculous. When a mother breast-feeds her baby, does she think, “How generous of me!”? That would be the farthest thing from her mind. Giving to her baby is giving to herself.

## The Work in Action -- “Dave Didn’t Acknowledge Me”

Dave, for example, will only and always be who you believe him to be—no more, no less. Do you understand? You believed him in, and you believe him out. He’ll always be who you believe him to be. You can never know him. To know yourself is what’s important. To know yourself is truly to know all of us. 

There’s Dave as he is, Dave the person, and then there’s the Dave you imagine him to be. One is Dave. One is not. It could be you’ve never met Dave. I’m serious. I often say, “No two people have ever met.”

## 5 EVERYDAY BUDDHAS

The end of suffering in the world begins with the end of suffering in you.
