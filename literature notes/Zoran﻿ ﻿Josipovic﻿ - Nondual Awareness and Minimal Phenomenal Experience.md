# Nondual Awareness and Minimal Phenomenal Experience

## Highlights

> We have previously proposed that the impasse in today’s scientific understanding of consciousness
>  would be helped by understanding consciousness itself or nondual awareness (NDA), a basic
>  aspect of consciousness that is different from all other phenomenal contents and functions of
>  consciousness and from global states of arousal (Josipovic, 2014, 2019; Josipovic and Baars,
>  2015). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv36nk5z13cwnf4p13y2vgsq))

> In line with

>  perspective that consciousness-as-such is first and foremost a

>  (and consequently best described as a purely immanent self-

>  belief is based on a limited interpretation that being a unique
>  kind is due only to conceptual categorization. It also conflates
>  phenomenological and ontological levels of discourse. The claim

> Starting with relaxation and silencing of the layers of inner narrative related to autobiographical-relational-social self, it progresses to the cessation of processes specifying phenomenal core self, such  as agency, body-ownership, and spatio-temporal located-ness, then to the basic interoceptive sense of body presence (Farb et al., 2007; Siderits et al., 2013; Dahl et al., 2015; Dor-Ziderman et al., 2016; Metzinger, 2020). However, such temporary quieting down in and of itself may not yet be cessation of the constructed self as the implicit categorizations that reify the self and objects may be still operating in the unconscious substrate (Germano and Waldron, 2006). Thus, selflessness can be understood in a more refined way as not merely inner silence but as a more fundamental transformation of the nature of cognition in which cognitive processes switch from the exclusive reliance on conceptually constructed dualistic subject-object structures to a more direct unconstructed way of cognizing via NDA itself.
