## Highlights

> We have previously proposed that the impasse in today’s scientific understanding of consciousness
>  would be helped by understanding consciousness itself or nondual awareness (NDA), a basic
>  aspect of consciousness that is different from all other phenomenal contents and functions of
>  consciousness and from global states of arousal (Josipovic, 2014, 2019; Josipovic and Baars,
>  2015). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv36nk5z13cwnf4p13y2vgsq))


> In particular, it has
>  been proposed that so-called minimal phenomenal experiences (MPEs) or full absorption
>  states are examples of consciousness-as-such (Metzinger, 2019). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv36p76hva0pd4b2xv05evnm))


> Consciousness-as-such has been present as a central concern in most Asian contemplative
>  traditions and philosophies, where a great variety of terms have been created to point to it,
>  such as pure consciousness, pure awareness, NDA, rigpa, timeless or choiceless awareness,

> Two main ways of seeing consciousness-as-such have emerged
>  in these traditions. According to one, it is a state of full
>  absorption with maximally reduced phenomenal content (Sansk.
>  Samadhi), akin to a deep dreamless sleep, but not entirely
>  unconscious, and without any knowable properties (Nikhilananda,
>  1990). According to the other, it is an awareness which is in

>  processes including those that reify it, yet it inherently knows
>  itself to be aware (Rabjam, 2001). In the contemporary scientific
>  and philosophical discourse, these two views are often conflated,
>  sometimes under one term of MPE (Metzinger, 2019). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv370pxq515gggc9sk5btvn2))


> In line with
>  our previous work (Josipovic, 2014, 2019), we advance the
>  perspective that consciousness-as-such is first and foremost a
>  type of awareness, that is non-conceptual, non-propositional,
>  and nondual, in other words, non-representational. This
>  awareness is a unique kind, and cannot be reduced to a level

> What makes consciousness-as-such or NDA a unique kind
>  is that it is aware, and inherently knows itself to be aware,
>  without relying on mental representations (Josipovic, 2019).
>  The two most common fixed beliefs that make this difficult
>  to understand are that all knowing has to be mediated mental
>  representations, also known as strong representationalism, and
>  that being a unique kind necessarily implies naive essentialism
>  and substance dualism. The first belief has been argued against
>  extensively by most nondual contemplative traditions, especially
>  the Buddhist ones
>  (Rabjam, 2007; Dunne, 2015; Josipovic,
>  2019), as well as, by the phenomenologists, as this well-known
>  quote indicates: “The pre-reflective self-awareness of an experience
>  is not mediated by foreign elements such as concepts and
>  classificatory criteria, nor by any internal difference or distance.
>  It is an immediate and direct self-acquaintance which is
>  characterized by being completely and absolutely irrelational
>  (and consequently best described as a purely immanent self-
>  presence)” (Frank, as quoted in Zahavi, 1998). The second
>  belief is based on a limited interpretation that being a unique
>  kind is due only to conceptual categorization. It also conflates
>  phenomenological and ontological levels of discourse. The claim
>  that differentiating awareness and phenomenal contents creates
>  an artificial duality (Bayne et al., 2016) does not apply to
>  NDA, which, as we will see, though distinct, co-occurs with
>  phenomena nondually (Rabjam, 2001; Josipovic, 2019). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv39g1va950jp69yfg2taz6z))

> NDA has traditionally been compared to a mirror, while

>  is, without associating, evaluating, forming decisions, or taking
>  itself as a reified subject that knows phenomena as objects.
>  Thus, the perceptual, affective, or cognitive contents and the
>  states of arousal that co-occur with NDA are, so to speak,
>  parallel to it, the way that images in a mirror are to the
>  mirror itself. Just as a mirror is unaffected by images reflected
>  in it, the basic properties of NDA remain, in principle, invariant
>  regardless of what and how much phenomenal content is
>  present, irrespective of the level of arousal (above a certain
>  minimum threshold). The level of arousal can be compared
>  in this metaphor to the amount of illumination in the room,
>  so that some minimum amount
>  is necessary for the mirror
>  to reflect anything, but aside from that, changing the level of
>  illumination affects only images in the mirror and not the
>  mirror itself. Since phenomena do not affect NDA; NDA can
>  encompass and pervade any type of content, whether perceptual,
>  affective, or cognitive. It then knows phenomena as essentially
>  not different from itself (Rabjam, 2007). That is, in addition
>  to individual characteristics that make them appear the way
>  they do, phenomena at
