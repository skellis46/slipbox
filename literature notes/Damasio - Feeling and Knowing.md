# Damasio - Feeling and Knowing

## Before we begin

### 1

> In an attempt to answer the critical question, I focus on two observations. One of them relates to the unique anatomical and functional features of the interoceptive nervous system—the system responsible for signaling from the body to the brain. These features are radically different from those that can be found in other sensory channels, and although some of them have previously been documented, their significance has been overlooked. And yet they help explain the peculiar melding of “body signals” and “neural signals” that decisively contributes to experiencing the flesh.
> Another pertinent observation concerns the equally unique relationship between the body and the nervous system, specifically the fact that the former entirely contains the latter within its borders. The nervous system, including its natural core, the brain, is located in its entirety within the territory of the body proper and is fully conversant with it. As a consequence, body and nervous system can interact directly and abundantly. Nothing comparable holds for the relation between the world external to our organisms and our nervous systems. An astonishing consequence of this peculiar arrangement is that feelings are not conventional perceptions of the body but rather hybrids, at home in both body and brain.

## 1. On being

### In the Beginning Was Not the Word

> Sensing is not perceiving, and it is not constructing a “pattern” based on something else to create a “representation” of that something else and produce an “image” in mind. On the other hand, sensing is the most elementary variety of cognition.

### The Purpose of Life

> Eventually, when multicellular and multisystem organisms became all the rage—that was about three and a half billion years later—homeostasis was assisted by newly evolved coordinating devices known as nervous systems. The stage was set for those nervous systems to not just manage actions but also represent patterns. Maps and images were on their way, and minds—the feeling and conscious minds that nervous systems made possible—became the result. Gradually, over a few hundred million years, homeostasis began to be partly governed by minds. All that was needed now for life to be managed even better, was creative reasoning based on memorized knowledge.

> Sensing (detecting) is most basic, and I believe it is present in all living forms. Minding is next. It requires a nervous system and the creation of representations and images, the critical component of minds. Mental images flow relentlessly in time and are infinitely open to manipulation so as to yield novel images. As we will see, minding opens the way to feeling and consciousness. There is not much hope of elucidating consciousness if we do not insist on distinguishing these intermediate steps.

### The Embarrassment of Viruses

### Brains and Bodies

> While it is true that consciousness, as we know it, only fully emerges in organisms endowed with nervous systems, it is also true that consciousness requires abundant interactions between the central part of those systems—the brain proper—and varied non-nervous parts of the body.

> What the body brings to the marriage with a nervous system is its foundational biological intelligence, the non-explicit competence that governs life as it meets homeostatic demands and that eventually is expressed in the form of feeling. 

### Nervous Systems as Afterthoughts of Nature

### On Being, Feeling, and Knowing

> The history of living organisms began four billion years ago and has taken several paths. In the branch of life history that led to us, I like to imagine three distinct and consecutive evolutionary stages. A first stage is hallmarked by being; a second is dominated by feeling; and a third is defined by knowing in the general sense of the term. Curiously, in each contemporary human, something can be gleaned akin to those same three stages, and they develop in the same sequence. The stages of being, feeling, and knowing correspond to separable anatomical and functional systems that coexist inside each of us humans and are engaged as needed in adult life.1

> Nervous systems enable both complex movements and, eventually, the beginning of a real novelty: minds. Feelings are among the first examples of mind phenomena, and it is difficult to exaggerate their significance. Feelings allow creatures to represent in their respective minds the state of their own bodies preoccupied with regulating the internal organ functions required by the necessities of life: feeding and drinking and excreting; defensive posturing such as occurs during fear or anger, disgust or contempt; social coordination behaviors such as cooperation, conflict; the display of flourishing, joy, and exaltation; and even of those behaviors related to procreation.

> Feelings provide organisms with experiences of their own life. Specifically, they provide the owner organism with a scaled assessment of its relative success at living, a natural examination grade that comes in the form of a quality—pleasant or unpleasant, light or intense. This is precious and novel information, the kind of information that organisms confined to a “being” stage cannot obtain.
> Not surprisingly, feelings are important contributors to the creation of a “self,”3 a mental process animated by the state of the organism, and are anchored in its body frame (the frame constituted by muscular and skeletal structures), and oriented by the perspective provided by sensory channels such as vision and hearing.
> Once being and feeling are structured and operational, they are ready to support and extend the sapience that constitutes the third member of the trio: knowing.

> Feeling provides us with knowledge of life in the body and, without missing a beat, makes that knowledge conscious. (In chapters III and IV we shall explain how feelings manage to do so.) This is a pivotal, fundamental process, and yet, in a most ungrateful manner, we barely notice it, distracted as we are by the thunder of another branch of knowing, the one that is constructed by the sensory systems—vision, hearing, body sensations, taste, and smell—with the help of memory. The maps and images created on the basis of sensory information become the most abundant and diverse constituents of mind, side by side with ever present and related feelings. More often than not, they dominate the mental proceedings.
> Curiously, each sensory system is, in and of itself, devoid of conscious experience. The visual system, for example, our retinas, visual pathways, and visual cortices, produces maps of the outside world and contributes the respective, explicit visual images. But the visual system would not allow us to automatically declare those images as our images, as occurring inside our organism. We would not relate those images to our beings, we would not be conscious of those images. Only the coordinated operation of the three kinds of processing—the kinds that have to do with being, feeling, and knowing—allows the images to be connected to our organism, literally referred to it and placed within it. Only then can experience emerge.

> What follows from this momentous but unheralded physiological step is nothing short of extraordinary. Once experiences begin to be committed to memory, feeling and conscious organisms are capable of maintaining a more or less exhaustive history of their lives, a history of their interactions with others and of their interaction with the environment, in brief, a history of each individual life as lived inside each individual organism, nothing less than the armature of personhood.

## 2. About Minds and the New Art of Representation

### Intelligence, Minds, And Consciousness

> Explicit human intelligences require a mind and the assistance of mind-related developments: feeling and consciousness. They require perception, and memory, and reasoning. The contents of minds are based on spatially mapped patterns that represent objects and actions. To begin, the contents correspond to the objects and actions that we perceive both in the interior of our organisms and in the world around us. The contents of the spatially mapped patterns we built can be mentally inspected. 

> Finally, the contents of mind are manipulable, meaning that we, owners of the patterns, can mentally chop them in parts and rearrange the parts in myriad ways to yield novel patterns. When we attempt to solve a problem, reasoning is the name we give to the cutting and moving about that we engage in as we pursue a solution.
A convenient way of referring to the mental patterns that constitute minds is the word images. By images I do not mean “visual” images only but rather any patterns produced by the dominant sensory channels: visual, of course; auditory; tactile; visceral. When we play creatively in our minds, we do use our imaginations, correct?

> But different as their manners are, the two kinds of intelligences came into existence to perform the same job—solving problems posed by the struggle for life. 

> Viruses are nonliving things that act intelligently so as to foster the expansion of their potentially life-producing cargo: nucleic acids.

### Sensing Is Not The Same As Being Conscious And Does Not Require A Mind



> Sensing alone does not entitle an organism to mind or consciousness. There is a precedent to be observed, however. Consciousness only becomes possible in organisms capable of sensing and capable of making minds.

> Bacteria and plants operate as they “should,” according to the imperatives of life regulation (or homeostasis), but they do so blindly—by which I mean that they do not know why or how they do what they do. The chemical machinery that runs their actions so successfully is not represented in another part of their organisms, and it has no possibility of revealing itself to the owner organism. The parts and the mechanisms involved in the organism’s success or failure do their job but are never “pictured” elsewhere within that organism. Nowhere within such organisms can the parts or the machinations ever constitute explicit knowledge.

> Anesthetics do not target minds specifically—minds are no longer possible once sensing is blocked. And anesthetics do not target consciousness either, because, as we will propose, consciousness is a particular state of mind and it cannot occur in the absence of mind.

> Once we are capable of consciousness, what we become conscious of is the contents of our minds.
Minds equipped with feeling and with some perspective on the world around them are conscious and are widely present in the animal kingdom, not just in humans. All mammals and birds and fish are minded and conscious, and I suspect that so are social insects. 

### THE CONTENTS OF MINDS

> When we relate and combine images in our minds and transform them within our creative imaginations, we produce new images that signify ideas, concrete as well as abstract; we produce symbols; and we commit to memory a good part of all the imagetic produce. As we do so, we enlarge the archive from which we will draw plenty of future mental contents.

-this section is amazing re what is "in" our minds. Sensations,feelings, memory, etc

### UNMINDED INTELLIGENCE

> Unminded intelligence precedes the variety of intelligence based on minds by a few billion years. Unminded intelligence is concealed in the depths of biology, and the word “recondite” is an even better term for the process. Unminded intelligence is well hidden behind the workings of molecular pathways that accomplish smart things for living organisms and can assist nonliving vessels, such as viruses, in accomplishing their mission.
Unminded intelligence manifests itself widely, in reflexes, in habits, in emotive behaviors, in competition and cooperation among organisms. Be mindful of the mindless; their repertoire is wide. And, reader, please realize that we, lofty and minded humans, also benefit from unminded intelligence mechanisms at all hours of the day.

### THE MAKING OF MENTAL IMAGERY

### TURNING NEURAL ACTIVITY INTO MOVEMENT AND MIND

> In other words, neurobiological “mapped patterns” turn into the “mental events” we call images. And when these events are part of a context that includes feeling and self-perspective, then, and only then, they become mental experiences, which is to say that they become conscious.

### FABRICATING MINDS

> In this regard, physicists such as Roger Penrose, the biologist Stuart Hameroff, and the computer scientist Hartmut Neven have suggested that quantum-level processes operating inside cells, specifically in neurons, are important players in mental events.1
In their favor, recent developments in general biology suggest that sub-molecular, quantum-level events are critical to account for complex biological processes such as photosynthesis. The same applies to sonar, echolocation, and the determination of magnetic north in birds, all “mind-related” phenomena.
I note that in my perspective the above considerations apply to the fabrication of mind and only to mind. As I will show in the next chapters, explaining consciousness—explaining how to make minds conscious—does not require us to invoke the sub-molecular level, while explaining the fabric of mind may. Consciousness is a systems-level phenomenon. It calls for a rearrangement of the furniture of mind, not the fabrication of the individual pieces.

### ALGORITHMS IN THE KITCHEN

## 3 On Feelings

> Feeling probably began its evolutionary history as a timid conversation between the chemistry of life and the early version of a nervous system within one particular organism. In creatures far simpler than we are, the exchange would have generated feelings such as plain well-being and basic discomfort rather than subtly graded feelings, let alone something as elaborate as localized pain. Still, what a remarkable advance. Those timid beginnings provided each creature with an orientation, a subtle adviser as to what to do next or not to do or where to go. Something novel and extremely valuable had emerged in the history of life: a mental counterpart to a physical organism.1

### AFFECT

> But make no mistake: vague, approximate, or precise, feelings are informative; they carry important knowledge and plant that knowledge firmly within the mind flow. Are muscles tense or relaxed? Is the stomach full or empty? Is the heart beating regularly and boringly, or is it skipping beats? Is the breathing easy or labored? Is there pain in my shoulder? We, who have the privilege of feeling, get to know about such states, and that information is valuable for the subsequent governance of our lives. But how do we come by such knowledge? What happens when we “feel,” as opposed to when we simply “perceive” objects in the world at large? What is required for us to feel, as opposed to merely perceive?

> First, everything we feel corresponds to states of our interior. We do not “feel” the furniture around us or the landscape. We can perceive the landscape and the furniture, and our perceptions can easily elicit emotive responses and result in the respective feelings. We can experience these “emotive feelings” and even name them—the beautiful landscape and the pleasant chair.
But what we “really” feel, in the proper sense of the term, is how either parts or the whole of our own organism are faring, moment by moment. Are their operations smooth and unimpeded, or are they labored? I call these feelings homeostatic because, as direct informers, they tell us if the organism is or is not operating according to homeostatic needs, that is, in a manner conducive or not to life and survival.

> Feelings owe their existence to the fact that the nervous system has direct contact with our insides and vice versa. The nervous system literally “touches” the organism’s interior, everywhere in that interior, and it is “touched” in return. The nakedness of the interior relative to the nervous system and the direct access the nervous system enjoys relative to that interior are part of the uniqueness of interoception, the technical term reserved for the perception of our visceral interior. Interoception is distinct from the perception of our musculoskeletal system, known as proprioception, and from the perception of the outside world, or exteroception. We can obviously use words to describe the experiences of feeling, but we do not need the mediation of words in order to feel.2

> Feelings, as enacted in our organism and experienced in our minds, exert a tug and a pull over us, literally disturb us, positively or negatively. Why and how can they do so? The first reason is clear: they are “insiders,” and they have access to our interior! The neural machinery that helps us “manufacture a feeling” interacts directly with the object that caused the feeling. For example, pain signals hailing from the capsule of a sick kidney travel into the central nervous system and coalesce to become a “renal colic.” But the process does not stop there. The central nervous system engenders a response back to the sick kidney’s capsule and modulates the continuation of the pain; it may even interrupt it. Other events in the area—for example, local inflammation—generate their own signals and contribute to the experience. The overall situation claims one’s attention and involvement.

> Rather than pinpointing a particular exterior feature such as one particular shape or sound with precision and stability, feelings often correspond to a range of possibilities. Feelings depict certain qualities within a scale and their variations in terms of tone and intensity. Figuratively, feelings do not take simple snapshots of external objects or events; feelings tape the whole show and the backstage activity, not just the surfaces, but also what is underneath.
Feelings are interactive perceptions. Compared with visual perceptions—the canonical example of perception—feelings are unconventional. Feelings gather their signals “inside the organism” and even “inside the objects located in that inside” rather than simply around the organism. Feelings depict actions that occur in our interior, as well as their consequences, and let us catch a glimpse of the viscera involved in those actions. Little wonder that feelings exert a special power over us.

> The operations of interior organs and systems are gradually represented in the nervous system, first in its peripheral nerve components, then in nuclei of the central nervous system (in the brain stem, for example), and later in the cerebral cortex. But there is an intense cooperation between body parts and neural elements. Body and nervous system remain interactive partners rather than separate “model” and “depiction.” What is ultimately imaged is neither purely neural nor purely bodily. It emerges from a dialogue, from a dynamic give-and-take between body chemistry and the bioelectrical activity of neurons. And, to make matters more complicated, at any moment an emotive response, such as fear or joy, can impose further changes in some viscera—which are the primary body actors in the emotive process—and generate, as a result, a new set of visceral states and a new set of brain-body partnerships. Such emotive responses change the organism and consequently change what is to be imaged via the body-brain partnership. The result is a new set of feelings—now partly “emotional” rather than purely “homeostatic”—and a new affective state. Moods are the consequence of this kind of dynamic, held over long periods of time. They are the origin of the “enthusiasm” or “lassitude” with which we enter each new day. So are varied degrees of excitement/arousal and dullness/sleepiness.

> Homeostasis: as we saw earlier, homeostasis is the process of maintaining the physiological parameters of a living organism (for example, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, visceral operations) within the range most conducive to optimal function and survival. (The related but distinct term “allostasis” refers to the mechanisms used by an organism as it seeks to regain homeostasis.)3
Emotions: collections of co-occurring and involuntary internal actions (for example, smooth muscle contractions, changes in heart rate, breathing, hormonal secretions, facial expressions, posture) triggered by perceptual events. The emotive actions are usually aimed at supporting homeostasis, for instance, countering threats (with fear or anger) or signaling successful states (with joy). When we recall events from memory, we also produce emotions.
Feelings: the mental experiences that follow and accompany varied states of organism homeostasis, whether primary (homeostatic feelings such as hunger and thirst, pain or pleasure) or provoked by emotions (emotional feelings such as fear, anger, and joy).4

> No matter what the “precise” contents of your mind may be—the landscapes, the furniture, the sounds, the ideas—those contents are necessarily experienced together with affect. What you perceive or remember, what you try to figure out by reasoning, what you invent or wish to communicate, the actions you undertake, the things you learn and recall, the mental universe made up by objects, actions, and abstractions thereof, all of these different processes can generate affective responses as they unfold. We can think of affect as the universe of our ideas transmuted in feeling, and it is also helpful to think of feelings in music terms. Feelings perform the equivalent of a musical score that accompanies our thoughts and actions.

### BIOLOGICAL EFFICIENCY AND THE ORIGIN OF FEELINGS

### GROUNDING FEELINGS I

### GROUNDING FEELINGS II

### GROUNDING FEELINGS III

> Because the actual object of the feeling/perception is none other than a part of the organism itself, that object is in fact located within the subject/perceiver. Astonishing! Nothing comparable occurs with our external perceptions, for example, visual or auditory. The objects of visual or auditory perceptions do not communicate with our bodies. The landscape we see or the songs we hear are not in touch with our bodies, let alone inside them. They exist in a physically separate space.

> In the feeling realm the situation is radically different. Because the object and subject of our feeling-percepts exist within the same organism, they can interact. The central nervous system can modify the body state that gives rise to a particular feeling and, by doing so, modify what is felt. This is an extraordinary setup that has no counterpart in the world of external perceptions. You may well want to modify an object that you are in the process of seeing; you may even wish to beautify a particular image that you are contemplating. Alas, you will not be able to actually do so except in your imagination.1

### GROUNDING FEELINGS IV

> We have just seen how the nervous system is inside the body and how body and nervous system interact directly, no intermediary needed. On the other hand, the nervous system is separate from the world external to the organism; it maps the external world via sensory processes such as vision and hearing, which are firmly planted in the body and use the body as an intermediary.
When we say that we “represent” or “map” objects in the world around us, the notion of “mapping” introduces distance between the “map” and “the things mapped,” as it should. There is often an abyss between the map and the object, 

> The consequences of these peculiarities are remarkable. Lack of myelin insulation and lack of blood-brain barrier allow signals from the body to interact with neural signals directly. In no way can interoception be regarded as a plain perceptual representation of the body inside the nervous system. There is, rather, an extensive commingling of signals.

### GROUNDING FEELINGS V

> By now we should be clear about the origin of feelings. Feelings arise in the interior of organisms, in the depth of viscera and fluids where the chemistry responsible for life in all its aspects reigns supreme. I am talking about the operations of the endocrine and immune and circulatory systems, in charge of metabolism and defense.

> What about the “function” of feelings? Although the history of cultures and even the history of science have made the role of feelings seem not just mysterious but unfathomable, the answer is apparent: feelings help with the management of life. More specifically, feelings operate as alerting sentinels. They inform each mind—fortunate enough to be so equipped—of the state of life within the organism to which that mind belongs. Moreover, feelings give that mind an incentive to act according to the positive or negative signal of their messages.

> The dramatic situation that we living creatures face concerns the maintenance of coherence and cohesion in our living organisms. The coherence and cohesion of the inanimate objects that surround me at this moment are no problem at all for those objects or for me. The objects are largely perpetual unless I decide to take an ax to the desk where I am writing, or to the chair where I sit, or to the shelves and books that surround me. Not so with my life and with the organism it animates. I need to feed them breakfast and lunch, I need to keep the body in a temperate environment, I need to prevent or avoid disease or treat it once I acquire it. I even need to maintain and nourish healthy social relationships with those around me so that circumstances arising in the social world do not impinge on the state of my interior and disturb the process of governing life in terms of homeostatic necessities.1

> Arising as they do in the interior of our adjustable and dynamic organisms, feelings are both qualitative and quantitative. They exhibit valence—the quality rankings that make their warnings and advice be worth the effort and also motivate our actions as needed. When I experience homeostatic feelings—a situation that reflects an appraisal of my interior when certain physiological profiles prevail—I get to know, firsthand, about the state of my life, and the negative or positive valence of the experience advises me to correct the situation or else accept it and do little or nothing. It makes me spring into action or enjoy the ride.
Consider how different the situation is when I look at the objects around me, or hear ambient sounds, or touch an object, or see other living organisms. In that situation I am also the recipient of information. I am still being “informed” of the presence and characteristics of the objects or organisms but now the source of the data is the external world and its objects and creatures. I am being told of externalities; I am not told about the interior of the entities I see or hear or touch. A perceptual distance separates me from those entities. They are not within my organism.

### GROUNDING FEELINGS VI

### GROUNDING FEELINGS VII

### HOMEOSTATIC FEELINGS IN A SOCIOCULTURAL SETTING

> We are quite familiar with the direct way in which illness gives way to discomfort and pain or exuberant health produces pleasure. But we often overlook the fact that psychological and sociocultural situations also gain access to the machinery of homeostasis in such a way that they too result in pain or pleasure, malaise or well-being. In its unerring push for economy, nature did not bother to create new devices to handle the goodness or badness of our personal psychology or social condition. It makes do with the same mechanisms. Playwrights and novelists and philosophers have long known this fact, but it remains unappreciated perhaps because the way things work tends to be even more nebulous when it comes to society and culture than when we deal with the rigors of the medical setting. Still, the pain of social shame is comparable to that of a raging cancer, betrayal can feel like a stab wound, and the pleasures that result from social admiration, for better and worse, can be truly orgasmic.1

### BUT THIS FEELING ISN’T PURELY MENTAL

> The above verse appears in the song “I Won’t Dance” written by Jerome Kern and made famous by Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. A good part of its success comes from the lyrics that Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh included in the song’s revised version. “But this feeling isn’t purely mental” is followed by “For heaven rest us, I’m not asbestos.” The naughty implication is that love is not just in the mind but also in the physical excitement that the hero notices when he dances with his beloved. He is not made of asbestos; he is a flesh-and-blood human being, and he reacts physically to the closeness and the romance! He is embarrassed, and he won’t dance anymore.
Sometimes popular wisdom beats laborious science. That feelings are not purely mental; that they are hybrids of mind and body; that they move with ease from mind to body and back again; and that they disturb the mental peace, those are the points of the song and my points in this chapter. All I need to add is that the power of feelings comes from the fact that they are present in the conscious mind: technically speaking, we feel because the mind is conscious, and we are conscious because there are feelings! I am not playing with words; I am merely stating the seemingly paradoxical but very real facts. Feelings were and are the beginning of an adventure called consciousness.


## 4. On Consciousness and Knowing

### WHY CONSCIOUSNESS? WHY NOW?

> The significance of consciousness comes from what it brings directly to the human mind and from what it subsequently allows the mind to discover. Consciousness makes mental experiences possible, from pleasure to pain, along with all that we perceive and memorize and recall and manipulate as we describe the world around and the world inside, in the process of observing, thinking, and reasoning. If we were to remove the conscious component from our ongoing mental states, you and I would still have images flowing in our minds, but those images would be unconnected to us as singular individuals. The images would not be owned by you or me or anyone else. They would flow unmoored. No one would know to whom such images belonged. Sisyphus would be fine. He is a tragic figure only because he knows that the abominable predicament is his.

> Pain, suffering, and the realization of death are especially empowering, more so I believe than well-being and pleasure. In this regard, I suspect that religions developed around that realization, none more so than the Abrahamic religions and Buddhism. To some extent, in its historical, evolutionary terms, consciousness was a forbidden fruit that once eaten made one vulnerable to pain and suffering and ultimately exposed to a tragic confrontation with death. This perspective is closely compatible with the idea that consciousness is introduced in evolution by the hand of feelings and not just any feelings but negative ones, in particular.

### NATURAL CONSCIOUSNESS



> Some of the varied meanings of consciousness relate to the optics of the observer/user. Philosophers, psychologists, biologists, or sociologists look at consciousness distinctly. So do ordinary people who hear, night and day, that certain problems are or fail to be “in their consciousness” and who must wonder if consciousness is the erudite label for being awake or attentive or simply having a mind. Yet quietly, hiding under its cultural baggage, there is an essential meaning of the word “consciousness,” one that contemporary neuroscientists, biologists, psychologists, or philosophers can recognize, even though they approach the phenomenon with varied methods and explain it in different ways. For all of them, more often than not, “consciousness” is a synonym of mental experience. And what is a mental experience? It is a state of mind imbued with two striking and related features: the mental contents it displays are felt, and those mental contents adopt one singular perspective. Further analysis reveals that the singular perspective is that of the particular organism within which the mind inheres. Readers who detect a kinship between the notions of “organism perspective,” “self,” and “subject” will not be wrong. Nor will they be wrong when they realize that “self,” “subject,” and “organism perspective” correspond to something quite tangible: the reality of “ownership.” The “organism owns its particular mind”; the mind belongs to its particular organism. We—me, you, whoever is the conscious entity—own an organism animated by a conscious mind.

> To make these considerations as transparent as possible, we need to be clear about the meaning of a few terms: mind, perspective, and feeling. Mind, as defined earlier, is one way of referring to the active production and display of images arising from actual perception or from memory recall or from both. The images that constitute a mind flow in a never-ending cortege and, as they do so, describe all sorts of actors and objects, all sorts of actions and relationships, all sorts of qualities without and with symbolic translations. Images, of every kind—visual, auditory, tactile, verbal, and so forth—individually or in combination, are natural vehicles of knowledge, they transport knowledge, they explicitly signify knowledge.
Perspective refers to “point of view,” provided there is no doubt that when I use the word view I do not mean vision only. The consciousness of blind people also has a perspective, but it has nothing to do with seeing. By point of view I mean something more general: the relation I hold not just to what I see but also to what I hear or touch and, importantly, even to what I perceive in my own body. The perspective I am talking about is that of the “owner” of the conscious mind. It corresponds, in other words, to the perspective held by a living organism as expressed by the images that flow within its own mind when it operates inside that same organism.
But we can go a bit further in our search for the origin of perspective. Relative to the world around us, the standard perspective of most living organisms is largely defined from the head of those organisms. In part this is due to the placement of sensory probes—of sight, sound, smell, taste, and even balance—at the top (or front end) of the body. And of course we, sophisticated creatures, also know that the brain is in the head!
Curiously relative to the world inside our organisms, perspective is provided by feelings that unequivocally reveal the natural link between mind and body. Feelings let the mind know, automatically, without any questions being asked, that mind and body are together, each belonging to the other. The classic void that has separated physical bodies from mental phenomena is naturally bridged thanks to feelings.
What else do we need to say about feeling in the context of consciousness? We need to assert that self-reference is not an optional feature of feeling but a defining, indispensable one. And we can venture further: we can declare feeling a foundational component of standard consciousness.

> Consciousness, then, is a particular state of mind resulting from a biological process toward which multiple mental events make a contribution. The operations of the body’s interior signaled via the interoceptive nervous system contribute the feeling component, while other operations within the central nervous system contribute imagery describing the world around the organism as well as its musculoskeletal frame. These contributions converge, in a regimented way, to produce something quite complex and yet perfectly natural: the encompassing mental experience of a living organism caught, moment after moment, in the act of apprehending the world within itself and, wonder of wonders, the world around itself. The conscious process takes life within an organism, as expressed in mental terms, and locates it within its own physical boundaries. Mind and body are given joint property of this ensemble, complete with notarized title, and they relentlessly celebrate their luck, good or bad, until they fall asleep.

### THE PROBLEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS

> The biological formulation of the hard problem, however, is unsound. Asking why should physical processes “in the brain” give rise to conscious experience is the wrong question. While the brain is an indispensable part of the generation of consciousness, nothing suggests that the brain generates consciousness alone. On the contrary, the non-neural tissues of the organism’s body proper contribute importantly to the creation of any conscious moment and must be a part of the problem’s solution. This happens most notably via the hybrid process of feeling, which we regard as a critical contributor to the making of conscious minds.4

> What does it mean to say “I am conscious”? At the simplest level imaginable, it means to say that my mind, at the particular moment in which I describe myself as conscious, is in possession of knowledge that spontaneously identifies me as its proprietor. Foundationally, the knowledge concerns myself in varied ways: (a) my body, about which I am continuously informed in greater or lesser detail via feeling, (b) along with facts that I recall from memory and that may pertain (or not) to the perceptual moment and are also part and parcel of myself. The scale of the knowledge fest that renders minds conscious varies depending on how many honorable guests attend, but certain guests are not only honored but obligatory. Let me identify them: first, some knowledge about the current operations of my body; second, some knowledge as retrieved from memory, about who I am at the moment and about who I have been, recently and in the long ago past.

> I am full of admiration for how our living organisms—the parts that we call neural and those that we tend to ignore and dismiss as “the rest of the body”—have concocted the processes that result in mental states imbued with feeling and a sense of personal reference. 

### WHAT IS CONSCIOUSNESS FOR?
> First, consciousness helps organisms govern their lives in keeping with the strict requirements of life regulation. This is true of many nonhuman species that preceded us and dramatically true of humans. This should not be surprising. After all, one of the foundations of consciousness is feeling, whose purpose it is to assist with the governance of life in line with homeostatic requirements. One might say, in an effort to give the birth of consciousness its due, that there is a chronology, that feeling emerged in evolution just one half step ahead of consciousness, that feeling is, literally speaking, a stepping-stone for consciousness. The reality, however, is that the functional value of feelings is tied to the fact that they are unequivocally referred to their owner organism and inhabit their owner-organism’s mind. Feelings gave birth to consciousness and gifted it generously to the rest of the mind.

> It is possible for independent living organisms to proceed successfully, without minds or consciousness, as we see in bacteria and plants. Their problems of existence and persistence can be solved with far less panache by a powerful non-minded competence, a sort of sneaky and very intelligent forerunner of mind and consciousness combined. I call this non-conscious competence “sneaky” because it ends up governing the life of non-conscious creatures quite well, without the athletic trappings of subjective experiences.

> Because consciousness connects the mind indelibly to a specific organism, it assists the mind in making a pressing case for the particular needs of that organism. And when organisms can mentally describe the degree of their needs and can apply knowledge to respond to those needs, then theirs is the universe to conquer. Conscious minds help organisms clearly identify what is required for their survival, and feel their way through the requirements. Often, depending on the degree of feeling involved, consciousness may demand and even impose a response to the identified needs. Explicit knowledge and reason provide resources not available to implicit forms of competence, which are governed by concealed varieties of intelligence and responsive only to basic homeostasis. Knowledge and creative reasoning invent novel responses to specific needs.

> Organisms with large mental capacities use consciousness—that is, the ownership reference of those mental capacities to their bodies—in their calculations and creative endeavors. Their entire program of behavior benefits from consciousness. Rather than asking why our creative processes should be accompanied by consciousness, we should wonder how any of our best behaviors would be possible—let alone useful—in the absence of consciousness.

### MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS ARE NOT SYNONYMOUS

> Consciousness is a distinctive state of mind, but the words “consciousness” and “mind” are often used as if they were synonymous and corresponded to the same process. 

> They and their listeners become unable to envision the central mechanism of consciousness as a modification of the primary process of mind.
The confusion is a consequence of the “composition problem.” The constitutive components of complex phenomena are difficult to glean under the functional envelope that obscures them. Referring to “conscious minds” instead of “consciousness”—as I do in the subtitle of this book—is helpful because “conscious” qualifies “minds” and serves notice not all mind states are necessarily conscious, that there are components involved in the making of consciousness.

> In my proposal consciousness is an enriched state of mind. The enrichment consists in inserting additional elements of mind within the ongoing mind process. These additional mind elements are largely cut from the same cloth as the rest of the mind—they are imagetic—but thanks to their contents they announce firmly that all the mental contents to which I currently have access belong to me, are my thing, are actually unfolding within my organism. The addition is revelatory.

> Revealing mental ownership is first and foremost accomplished by feeling. When I experience the mental event we call pain, I can actually localize it to some part of my body. In reality, the feeling occurs in both my mind and my body, and for a good reason. I own both, they are located within the same physiological space, and they can interact with each other.
The manifest ownership of mental contents by the integrated organism where they arise is the distinctive trait of a conscious mind. When this trait is absent or not dominant, the simpler term mind is the appropriate descriptor.
The mechanisms involved in enriching a mind with a firm connection to its rightful owner organism consist in inserting in the organism’s mental flow the contents that connect mind and organism owner unequivocally. They occur at the level of systems. They should not be regarded as a mystery.

> For a conscious mind to emerge, I need to enrich a plain mind process with knowledge that pertains to my organism and that identifies me as the owner of my life, my body, and my thoughts.

> Both the simple, conscious mind process focused on a mundane problem and the rich, panoramic, conscious mind process that encompasses a vast amount of history depend on an initiation rite: the identification of an “owner-mind” which requires the placement of that mind in the setting of its body.

### BEING CONSCIOUS IS NOT THE SAME AS BEING AWAKE

### CONSCIOUSNESS (DE)CONSTRUCTED

> Why do I believe there is a plausible solution for the problem of consciousness? First, because I can envision a means whereby mental contents are transparently connected to a feeling subject and the feeling subject assumes ownership of those contents. Second, because the means I envision calls for the use of a physiological mechanism whose status, at the level of systems, is reasonably understood.


## 5. In All Fairness: An Epilogue

> The exaggerated distinction between human and nonhuman coping abilities, generated by an exceptionalist approach to human faculties, is deeply flawed. It is grandiose when it comes to humans; it unjustifiably diminishes nonhumans; and it fails to acknowledge the interdependence and cooperativity of living creatures, from the microscopic level to the human. Ultimately, it fails to acknowledge the presence of powerful motifs, designs, and mechanisms manifest in nature since life began—and even in the physics and chemistry that preceded it—and, in all likelihood, at least partly responsible for the blueprint of cultural developments usually attributed to humans.

> Minds, based on the mapping of overt, multidimensional patterns, were a powerful advance that permitted, simultaneously, making images of the world outside the organisms and images of the world inside them. The images of the exterior guided the successful actions of organisms in their environments, but feelings, the hybrid, interactive processes of the interior, at once mental and physical, were the most extraordinary enablers of adaptive and creative actions ever since nervous systems appeared on the scene, a mere 500 million years ago. They provided guidance and incentive to the creatures so equipped and founded consciousness too.

> By all means, we should indeed admire and even exalt the unique achievements of the human conscious mind and all the amazing novelty it created, over and above the solutions nature had already shepherded along. But we need to balance the account of how humans got to the present and recognize the fact that the fundamental devices we have used to succeed in our niche consist of transformations and upgrades of devices previously used by other living forms throughout a long history of individual and social successes. We need to respect the phenomenal and incompletely understood intelligence and designs of nature itself.

> Behind the harmony or horror that we recognize in great art created by human intelligence and sensibility, there are related feelings of well-being, pleasure, suffering, and pain. Behind such feelings there are states of life that follow or violate the requirements of homeostasis. And underneath such life states there are chemical and physical process arrangements responsible for making life viable and for tuning the music of the stars and planets.
Acknowledging priorities and recognizing interdependence may come in handy as we cope with the ravages that we humans have inflicted on the earth and on its life, ravages that are likely responsible for some of the catastrophes we currently face, climate changes and pandemics being two prominent examples. It will give us an additional incentive to listen to the voices of those who dedicate their lives to thinking through the large-scale problems we face and recommend solutions that are wise, ethical, practical, and compatible with the big biological stage that humans occupy. There is some hope after all, and perhaps there should be some optimism as well.1
