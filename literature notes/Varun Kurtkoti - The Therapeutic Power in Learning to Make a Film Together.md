## Highlights

> In 2022, I was commissioned to make a documentary on the mental health issues of informal-sector workers. The Indian informal sector is a [complex network](https://aeon.co/videos/how-the-worlds-harshest-lockdown-hit-indias-millions-of-migrant-workers) of unorganised labour, based on workers who receive no written contract, paid leave, health benefits or social security. For many of these workers, mental healthcare is inaccessible and full of stigma. The planned film was intended to explore and express structural issues in Indian mental health discourse.
>  Ultimately, I ended up taking the project in a different direction: I facilitated a four-month-long weekend film school for workers, at the end of which a short film was made. Why fulfil the project in this way? The idea for the school stemmed from a realisation that filmmaking, in addition to serving as a tool to document issues in mental healthcare, could be a resource for addressing problems that workers were facing in a more direct way. Having dabbled in and benefited from Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed – a [theatrical methodology](https://aeon.co/essays/can-performing-shakespeare-help-to-cure-mental-illness) that gives audience members the power to imagine and navigate their own narratives, converting spectators to ‘spect-actors’– I wondered if film, too, could create a space for healing.

> As the Australian anthropologist Michael Taussig and other scholars have [expressed](https://www.routledge.com/Mimesis-and-Alterity-A-Particular-History-of-the-Senses/Taussig/p/book/9780415906876) through the concept of mimesis, humans seem to have a need to *become* other entities. For film viewers, this can involve not simply imitating the images in films, but absorbing the narrative and the style of a character – in a sense, making characters’ actions their own. One example of this is the Indian craze for pre- and post-wedding shoots, in which a cinematic love story between the bride and groom is woven, irrespective of the ground realities.

> In a manifesto published in *Afterimage* magazine in 1970, the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard proposed two ways to make films: making *political* films, and making films *politically.* To make a film politically, he suggests, is to ‘show the people in struggle’ and to strive to create change. In the spirit of making a film politically, the school and its participants approached the film in a way that gave them ownership over the work and their image. For example, a sanitation worker wrote the story in which the sanitation worker becomes a lawyer and argues for the rights of workers.
