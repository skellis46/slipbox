# Casper Andre Lugg - Artisan Sourdough Wholesome Recipes

_previous note:_ [[Vanessa Kimbell - Kimbell-2018-Sourdough]]

> Sourdough is a symbiotic relationship of wild yeast with lactic acid bacteria to ferment your bread. It is the oldest form of baking.

> Stone-ground spelt produces a velvety, supple dough that is wonderful to work with. A good stone-ground flour should feel oily when you rub it between your fingersâ€”this means that the oils from the germ of the grain have been preserved, as well as much of its aroma.
