# Lieberman - Exercised

_previous note:_ [[sitting on the ground]]

## Prologue

> Without seeming like a madman or an idiot, how would I explain to a hunter-gatherer, a farmer in Pemja, or even my great-great-great-grandparents that I spend most of my days sitting in chairs and then compensate for my idleness by paying money to go to a gym to make myself sweaty, tired, and uncomfortable on a machine that forces me to struggle to stay in the same place?

## Chapter 3: Sitting: Is It the New Smoking?

Unhappy Theseus, doom’d for ever there, Is fix’d by Fate on his eternal chair.
—Virgil, The Aeneid, book 6 (trans. John Dryden)

> Despite Ogden Nash’s observation that “people who work sitting down get paid more than people who work standing up,” a growing chorus of exercists who nag us to exercise condemn sitting as a modern scourge.1 One prominent physician has declared that chairs are “out to get us, harm us, kill us” and that “sitting is the new smoking.”2

- idea about project film of sitting 
- very useful Chapter on chairs!


> A good place to get carefully reviewed, consensus advice is the American College of Sports Medicine. Its most recent expert panel’s review of the evidence suggests I supplement my weekly quota of aerobic exercise with twice-weekly bouts of strength training that involve eight to ten different resistance exercises with ten to twelve repetitions each.59 Once I hit sixty-five years old, they recommend I increase my weight training to ten to fifteen repetitions.

> Make exercise necessary and fun. Do mostly cardio, but also some weights. Some is better than none. Keep it up as you age.
