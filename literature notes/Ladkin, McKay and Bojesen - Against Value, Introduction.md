# Ladkin, McKay and Bojesen - Against Value, Introduction

_previous note:_ [[art and culture glue human relations]]

> Whether utilised by those with elistist or least non-egalitarian ideological programmes in mind or by those wishing, broadly, to pursue an amiable impulse to defend the humanising effect of the arts and education, value, helped by the audit culture, which is its regulatory ecosystem, damages that which it seeks to measure.[p.1]

> [how arts and education] can be motivated by or incorporate a critique of value or values and how previous defences of the arts and education too often depend upon uncritical notions of value. *Against Value* probably sounds like a counter-intuitive way to go about describing and defending the value of anything. And it is.[p.2]

> ... the arts and education are fundamentally against value. It does not invalidate this claim that it is inherently paradoxical or that these arenas are constituted by all kinds of values as well as being critical of them; indeed, the truth that the arts may even also be expressions of the values they critique is primary evidence of the need for an understanding of them that goes against value.[p.2]

> As Benjamin famously puts it, 'There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism', an assessment which might give pause for thought when returning to the former UK secretary of state for culture, media, and sport's otherwise banal claim that the 'arts are a civilising influence'. Who, exactly, is in need of being civilised? What does the redemption offered by the arts matter when set against civilisation's unceasing barbarism, if art's value 'redeems the catastrophe of history'?[p.5]

> Value tends to take critical thinking as its first hostage: complexity, nuance, counter-intuitive logic, long-term planning, doubt all follow.[p.6]

> Value tends to stand in for that which has been sublimated; that is, the notion of value sits more easily with some palatable effect of culture rather than with those truths which culture seeks to repress. Value tends to be ruled by piety, by the conservatism of consensus.[p.6]

> Value tends to encourage the arts and education to mirror the values that dominate (in) a society. For example, the rise of participatory art goes hand in hand with the intensification of damage to the social contract between the individual and the state and the continuation of the transfer of the public good (both in terms of capital and the 'values' of the care of the state) into private capital (and its core value, profit). Its formal, aesthetic properties (networks, mobility, project work, affective labour) match, unnervingly, those of neoliberalism.[p.7]

> Value is often undefined, or worse, its instrumental use depends upon its fundamental vacuity. One of the tasks of value as a token is to stand in for something impossible to describe, something which is incommensurable or something which is ambivalent; when this happens, it does not speak, finally, to anything [p.8] 'intrinsic' but instead works to maximise fungibility, the ability of meaning to be manipulated toward the real and implicit purpose of those with the power to demand explications and justifications of value.[pp.7-8]

> Value is a function not an essence. It appears to warrant a final definition, some closing down of its opportunistic obedience, and yet value remains elusive because it claims attachment and dependence, to be the *value of something* or value *for someone*, even when (or especially when) it is pointing toward something held to be 'intrinsic'.[p.8]

> The temptation when writing on value ... is to imagine its critique confers a mastery over its contents.[p.8]

> A crisis forces us back to the questions themselves and requires from us either new or old answers, but in any case direct judgements. A crisis becomes a disaster only when we respond to it with preformed judgements, that is, with prejudices. Such an attitude not only sharpens the crisis but makes us forfeit the experience of reality and the opportunity for reflection it provides. – Hannah Arendt, "The Crisis of Education"[p.9]

> Cultural values were treated like any other values, they were what values always have been, exchange values; and in passing from hand to hand they were worn down like old coins. They lost the faculty which is originally peculiar to all cultural things, the faculty of arresting our attention and moving us. When this had come about, people began to talk of the 'devaluation of values' and the end of the whole process came with the 'bargain sale of values' during the twenties and thirties in Germany, the forties and fifties in France, when cultural and more 'values' were sold out together. – Hannah Arendt[p.10]
