## Highlights

> That *Reconsidering Reparations* became a “theory of everything” with climate change at its center is something of an accident. When he sat down to write his first book, Táíwò was interested in staking a position in a far narrower debate: Under what conditions could a program of reparations for those disadvantaged by the legacy of colonialism and the trans-Atlantic slave trade actually achieve justice?

> Táíwò’s notion of justice is broad. While many philosophers have traditionally conceived of justice as concerned above all with the resources available to people, Táíwò thinks the concept must be expanded to consider their “capabilities” — what kind of lives they are empowered to lead, not just the money and goods they have. If you want to achieve justice in a sense this expansive, he argues, redistributing cash and other material resources will only get you so far.

> “Are any of these other measures that we take toward racial justice going to have staying power in a world that’s 3 degrees hotter?” he has [said](https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/how-to-repair-the-planet). “In a world where there is rampant instability in our energy and housing systems? In a world of mass human displacement? In a world where the elites of the world feel very threatened?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6tk6rb1mdxstcvzmyah9a8))


> Though Táíwò is loath to declare loyalty to a particular ideology, he readily identifies as a leftist, and his views on climate change perhaps sit most comfortably under the umbrella of eco-socialism. Still, he is willing to follow his philosophical arguments to positions that are controversial in some leftist quarters. He has argued, for example, that carbon removal is an essential tactic in the pursuit of environmental justice, and he has opposed calls for bans on solar geo-engineering research, calling such arguments “performatively colonial.” What he opposes most of all is moralizing: If political purity gets in the way of improving the actual life experience of people now and in the future, then it has no place in his account of justice.

> “It’s very difficult to not treat climate change as one of the central questions confronting philosophers and people in general,” he told me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6tmz1kt9wcbk5qy1tx2g27))


> What sets Táíwò’s work apart is that he thinks the English-speaking world’s traditional accounts of justice are increasingly useless — and that the challenges posed by climate change can demonstrate why. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6tn07b1dw7zkkt4wq28wwe))


> Anglo-American political philosophy still operates [in the shadow of John Rawls](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/john-rawls-shadow-of-justice/), whose 1971 doorstop *A Theory of Justice* single-handedly revived an academic field that many considered dead. Rawls argued that justice consists of whatever principles all of a society’s members would agree to if they were to assume what he called a “veil of ignorance” — in other words, if they did not know the exact circumstances under which they would live. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6tp7v78hcx08e1qy0jr8n0))


> The idea is that a state could pursue justice by basing its laws and rules on principles that people would endorse if they knew nothing in advance of facts like their race or income. If every country operated on these grounds, then we would live in a just world. Whether or not you’ve heard of Rawls, if you have an idea that justice is more or less synonymous with something like fairness — and that the laws of states and governments should be set up in a way that advances this fairness — your thinking bears the mark of his influence.

> Táíwò thinks this approach might make sense if we all lived in completely autonomous countries with representative and functional governments. But we don’t. Given this, Táíwò argues that we cannot pursue justice without recognizing that we live in an interconnected world that distributes risks and benefits in profoundly unequal ways, regardless of what any of the 193 members of the United Nations might want. This is largely, Táíwò argues, because we are still living out the consequences of the Industrial Revolution and European colonialism, which established global patterns of wealth and resource accumulation that push some countries toward failure and others toward success, decades after many colonized countries gained independence.

> This paradox is at the core of Táíwò’s argument about the perils of a certain kind of identity politics, an argument he makes in a recent [essay](https://www.thephilosopher1923.org/post/being-in-the-room-privilege-elite-capture-and-epistemic-deference) that became his latest book, *Elite Capture*, published in May: Identifying a single person who can accurately and fully represent the voices of a marginalized group is easier said than done.

> ​“Perhaps,” he writes, “after we in the chattering class get the clout we deserve and secure the bag, its contents will eventually trickle down to the workers who clean up after our conferences, to slums of the Global South’s megacities, to its countryside. But probably not.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6txz7kcydjy7aw7n1j4fgf))


> The story of Táíwò’s own ascent to the chattering class underscores not only the moral perils he sees in a certain brand of identity politics, but also the ways that history tees up life outcomes in ways that only become visible in retrospect — another major theme of his work.

> “Part of the point of their immigrating here,” he [reflected](https://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/olfmi-tw/) in an interview as an adult, “was to become the sort of people that war didn’t happen to.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6ybgwwq18r9twhevqsebvc))


> These experiences informed a principle at the core of Táíwò’s philosophical viewpoint: that justice is a question of how both resources and personal security are distributed between different countries and communities as well as within them.

> “Their assumptions seemed to background stuff that I thought should be foregrounded,” he [remembered](https://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/olfmi-tw/) of those courses. “I just figured philosophy was the place you went to think about background assumptions.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6yqmgcg6ve7cyc9w5fk1fb))


> Táíwò thinks Rawls’ famous theory of justice is wrong on multiple counts. The first is its focus on states. Táíwò argues that many governments are incapable of securing just or fair outcomes for their citizens, because many of the biggest disadvantages they experience are imposed externally: Think here of the tiny Pacific island nations that stand to disappear altogether due to sea-level rise caused largely by emissions from early-industrializing countries like the United Kingdom. History has set some states up to succeed, and others to fail. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6yxhensq1fm56fgcqcd6kp))


> Second, Táíwò argues that Rawls proposed a “snapshot view” of justice: It establishes what a just set of outcomes would be at a single point in time, failing to recognize that circumstances today were often created in the past — and that what looks like justice to people alive today may harm their grandchildren. Building out coal power, for example, might make sense to present-day residents of a country like India — it’s cheap electricity that can power air-conditioning on increasingly scorching summer days — but such decisions contribute to global warming that will bring suffering to future generations.

> “The nature of the system is that it moves resources from yesterday to today to tomorrow,” Táíwò writes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6yyheh2bwdwg7f6qczhagy))


> To answer skeptics of his account of the guiding role that historical forces play in the present, Táíwò asks simply that we take a look at the best available data about the world around us (which is helpfully laid out in Appendix B of *Reconsidering Reparations*): The vast majority of former colonial powers, like the U.K. and France, have average incomes well over twice that of many of their former colonies. Metrics on life expectancy, maternal mortality, dietary adequacy, literacy, sanitation access, civil liberties, and political rights follow similar patterns. Taken together, these disparities make formerly colonized countries most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change — an ironic outcome, given that their late industrialization makes them least responsible for climate change in the first place.

> To some, a philosophy that accounts for the combined injustices of all of modern history might appear to put an ideal world out of actual reach. But although Táíwò is most thorough in his account of the way the world actually is, he doesn’t lose sight of the ideal. Instead, he ratchets his ambitions for the ideal higher. Because the colonial world order remains a force in people’s lives, a reparations project that achieves justice cannot simply compensate for past and present damages — it must be what Táíwò calls a “worldmaking project,” concerning itself not just with wealth and resource distribution but with building and maintaining environments that allow everybody to flourish within them. In this sense, he considers his project a “constructive” approach to reparations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6z0er2s1qg9zg77z129pf7))


> Táíwò thinks that this is best pursued by prioritizing the self-determination of individual communities, their ability to chart the course of their own destinies. On the local scale, he’s spoken approvingly of [citizen assemblies](https://grist.org/international/citizens-assembly-convention-climate-france-macron/) in contrast to the mass electoral politics we normally associate with democracy. (Recent experiments in this form have contributed to securing [abortion rights in Ireland](https://www.thejournal.ie/citizens-assembly-vote-3354416-Apr2017/) and [wind power in Texas](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/33177.pdf).) On the global scale, he calls for reviving egalitarian visions of an alternate international system, such as the New International Economic Order that Ghana, Nigeria, and dozens of other decolonized countries demanded of the United Nations in the 1970s.

> “Climate reparations should not be thought of simply as compensation for past environmental, economic, and social damages, but as world making,” the report reads. “Debt justice and enhanced climate finance should help build a platform for countries in the Global South to achieve low-carbon development and robust, resilient infrastructure.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw6z22p1ep4qjp9strr0kmj7))
