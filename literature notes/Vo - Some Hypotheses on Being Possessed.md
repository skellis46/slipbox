# Anh Vo – Some Hypotheses on Being Possessed: The Body as a Vessel

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself - somatics chapter]]

- recommended to me by Arabella Stanger on 22 November 2024 (Beginnings)

## LLM summary 

A short philosophical provocation: Anh Vo argues the body isn’t a private, bounded “I” but an open vessel continually inhabited by “others”—memories, ghosts, social forces. Embracing this everyday “possession” (interbeing) unsettles capitalist/property logics of selfhood and the biopolitical drive to optimize life, while suggesting ritual/sacrifice as ways to live with that porousness.
