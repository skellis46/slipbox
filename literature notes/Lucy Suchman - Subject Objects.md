- Note: From where did this subject object thinking come re humans and machines?


> Humans are not the sole arbiters of agency in these entity-making practices, as agency is ‘not an attribute, but the ongoing reconfigurings of the world’ (Barad, 2007: 141). Humans are, however, always already implicated in and part of the world’s reconfiguring, as well as of the capacities for being and action that arise.

> The robot can serve as a model for the Human insofar as its existence is framed as elucidating universally applicable truths about how humans work. And as a scientific object (rather than one created for instrumental purposes of service provision to humans, although these aims are often conflated in roboticists’ own writings), the laboratory robot’s ability to replicate the observable behaviours of persons is taken as evidence that those behaviours are, in turn, an effect of comparable mechanisms.5 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtgk54dezzwfn68n81t5dwr0))


> Rodney Brooks, Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT and in that respect (by academic lineage) grandfather of the robot Mertz, embraces this logic. He urges us to think beyond human exceptionalism by recognising that we are, in essence, machines. Brooks argues that an attachment to the ‘specialness’ of humans is anachronistic, a premise that he mobilises to open space for the possibility – even inevitability – of humanoid machines.

> On the face of it, the project of humanoid robotics might seem well aligned with
>  feminist theoretical arguments for the vitality of the inorganic, sharing the premise that agencies traditionally associated exclusively with the human, or even more broadly animal, need to be granted to nonhuman things.7 The divide between human and machine, in this respect, is no more an a priori than that between human and animal. But a commitment to rejecting essentialism, and to holding entanglements of the organic and inorganic in view, leaves begging the question of how else we might articulate differences that matter across category boundaries.

> Working from the premise that to be human or nonhuman is ‘a doing or becoming, not an essence’, and concerned to challenge tendencies toward human exceptionalism in feminist theory, Birke et al. (2004) take as their analytic subject object the laboratory rat, one of the animal kinds transformed into a model organism for contemporary science (see also Lynch, 1988; Davies, 2010; Holmberg, this volume). The laboratory rat in their analysis is at once an object of scientific practice and an ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtp4fm1pgc9qz2a4ttqecx99))

> The laboratory animal as model organism materialises a regime dedicated to the objectification and control of a nature taken to be separate from culture, while the work of science and technology studies has been to refigure the laboratory as a site where differences of subject and object, nature and culture, are made rather than given. These studies direct our attention to the cultural historical genealogies that inform the laboratory, and to the erasures that enable the seeming authorlessness of its products.

> The experimental apparatus required to verify the absence of manufacture included as one of its constituents the notion of ‘seeing for oneself’, and the figure of the ‘modest witness’ or disinterested observer, so central to the origin myth of technoscientific objectivity and to the demonstration as event (see also Latour, 1993; Haraway, 1997).

> The homely example of the door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman serves as illustration of Goffman’s notion of framing, in which a situation serves as a model for another:
>  Here, an original activity of cleaning is transformed through a new frame of meaning, that of the demonstration. Both the salesman and the householder would agree that, in an important sense, he is not really cleaning the floor but just showing how somebody would do so with his machine. This re-framing brings new meaning and rules of engagement, but the original activity is still relevant for understanding the new one. Indeed, its surface form will be identical in some respects and so, in another sense, the salesman’s cleaning is real: he is genuinely doing something that makes the floor cleaner.

> These technologies produced the now familiar catalogue of emotional types normalised across the circumstances of their occurrence (as anger, fear, excitement, and so forth), and treated as internally homogeneous, if variable in their quantity or intensity. This is a machinery generated through, but discursively separable from, specific bodies. And like other marks on bodies, once materialised as a representation or trace, emotions are extractable from their particular contexts of production. By the 1930s this science was well established, and what was characterised as the ‘objective’ inscription of emotions reached a representational consensus sufficient to support an associated industry of commercially manufactured emotion-gauging machines. It is from this point, in turn, that emotions are understood as processes in the general scheme of the body-as-machine (Dror, 2001: 362).

> An agent is autonomous, according to Maes, to the degree that it ‘decides itself how to relate its sensor data to motor commands in such a way that its goals are attended to successfully’ (1997: 136, see also Kember, 2003: 66–67). But others are uneasy with an autonomy that remains within the implicit bounds of goals given in advance by a designer, however independently those might be translated into action.

> We see here a different sense of imitation than that framed in Turing’s famous ‘imitation game’ (Turing, 1950). While Turing’s preoccupation was with imagining a coherent sense for the question ‘Can machines think?’, the focus of the Adaptive Systems Group shifts from machine intelligence to the generation of affective, communicative relations. Recruited to ‘mirror’ the humans who engage with it in play, the robot does so not as a model Human, but as part of an ‘oscillating and affective assemblage’ of unfolding sociomaterial connections (Neumark, 2001: 166).

> In a way reminiscent of the encounter engendered by Mertz with which we began, if absent from the robot’s narration, becoming worldly is manifest here as moments of bodily imitation and connection that travel as a generative reiteration and a fleeting glance, all animated by affective dynamics that escape their classification. These are what Haraway has identified as technoscience’s ‘immeasurable results’ (1997: xiii). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtpdjqdjrqa5krkedkh405aq))


> In her introduction to the collection Biographies of Scientific Objects, historian

Moving ontologies sit at the heart of recent feminist theorising, most fundamentally in relation to the collective project of unfixing categorical delineations of identity and difference in favour of attention to the times and places through which lines of differentiation are enacted and come to matter (Ahmed, 1998; Barad, 2007; Currier, 2003; Cussins, 1998; Haraway, 1989, 1997, 2008). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtpdqh36cnr6jvwe181p5whd))


> If objects, as Haraway reminds us, are ‘boundary projects’ (1991: 201), the figure of the humanoid robot sits provocatively on the boundary of subjects and objects, threatening its breakdown at the same time that it reiterates its founding identities and differences. Whether as a promise to subjectify the world of the Object, or a threat to objectify the sanctity of the Subject, the robot’s potential is perpetually mobilised within both technical and popular imaginaries. At the same time, the material assemblage of the robot is in complex intra-action with its accompanying stories, never quite realising its promise but always also exceeding the narratives that animate it.

> In his discussion of demonstrations Smith poses the question: What other figures
>  of the audience to the demonstration might there be than either the innocent witness to the workings of nature, or the cynical constructivist who sees only artifice? In her consideration of Shapin and Schaffer’s history of modern science’s modest witness, Haraway offers a response to this question. She points out that the theatre of the modest witness to nature stages a subject–object split that erases the presence of knowers from what is known (1997: 23–24). While the practice of credible testimony is very much at stake in Haraway’s writings she is after, as she puts it, ‘a more corporeal, inflected, and optically dense... kind of modest witness’ (1997: 24). The latter is premised, among other things, on stories that position the audience inside rather than outside of the action (1997: 36). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtpdz1tvhtketht470n57fj5))


> Barad’s trope of entanglement suggests an approach to human–robot encounters that takes each framing of the humanoid robot not as disinterested reportage or as a response to an independently existing entity, but as an apparatus that includes particular objects of attention and concern and inseparable knowing subjects (see also Haraway, 1997: 218). This is a method through which we might restore non-innocence to robot demonstrations and to the subject object relations that they enact. To do so requires thinking about the narratives and materialisations of robotics in terms of accountabilities inseparable from truth claims, tracing out their genealogies and their associated politics. The goal of such an exercise, as Haraway suggests, is to ‘ferret out how relations and practices get mistaken for nontropic things-in-themselves in ways that matter to the chances for liveliness of humans and nonhumans’ (1997: 141).

> Alac’s close reading of the collaborative labours involved in the effort to replicate human movements (including the resistances met in getting the robot to move in those ways) articulates the sense in which, in her words, ‘the body as a discrete and unified entity disintegrates through practice’ and reveals the social body as always already multiparty bodies-in-interaction (2009: 492). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gtpe80nq65xgbrm34wpx6ds3))


> Insofar as communication acts as an integrating circuit for these translations, it is a crucial site for reconceptualisation. Communication, as Emanuel Schegloff (1982) reminds us, is not the medium through which an exchange of messages takes place, or the means by which intentionality and interpretation operationalise themselves. Rather, interaction in the ethnomethodological sense is a name for the ongoing, contingent coproduction of a mutually intelligible sociomaterial world. In attempting to understand the constitution of the human/ machine interface I have argued that subject/subject intra-actions involve forms of mutual intelligibility intimately connected with, but also importantly different from, the intelligibilities involved in relations of subject and objects (see Suchman, 2007a). The term ‘mutual’, with its implications of reciprocity, is crucial here, and I would argue needs to be understood as a particular form of collaborative world-making characteristic of those beings whom we identify as sentient organisms.

> In their introduction to the collection Queering the Non/Human Noreen Giffney
>  and Myra J. Hird (2008) cite the work of artist Karl Grimes in his exhibit Future Nature, a show of photographs of animal embryos and foetuses in glass jars, originally used in scientific and medical experiments. Grimes explains that his photographs of these specimens attend to animals that are ‘constantly on the verge of becoming... yet frozen in time and death’ (cited in Giffney and Hird, 2008: 2). The sense of becoming here lies within a developmental imaginary, of something arrested on its way to realisation. Grimes’ photographic portraiture, Giffney and Hird observe, suggestively ‘revitalises what have been forgotten as mere scientific remains, turning former objects into present subjects’ (2008: 2). Discussing Grimes’ photograph of a preserved Axolotl salamander, Giffney and Hird ask:
>  Is this simply putting the animal to use for the purposes of poring over the ins and outs of the Human, thus reinscribing by default the Human at the centre of this very meditation? Perhaps. Yet in its irreducible difference, Axolotl insists that we respond to it on its own terms – partly ascribed by Grimes certainly – yet also set down by the animal voluptuously appearing before us, resplendent in its cacophony of contradictions; a signifier of the differential relation between the Human and the nonhuman...

> Feminist theory alerts us that questions of difference cannot be addressed apart

>  a materialist, antireductionist, nonfunctionalist, nonanthropomorphic, and semiotically complex sense of the dynamism of nonhumans in knowledge-making and worldbuilding encounters.. . How to ‘figure’ actions and entities nonanthropomorphically and nonreductively is a fundamental theoretical, moral and political problem. Practices of figuration and narration are much more than literary decoration. Kinds of membership and kinds of liveliness – kinship in short – are the issues for all of us.
