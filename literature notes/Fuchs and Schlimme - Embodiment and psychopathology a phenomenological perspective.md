# Fuchs and Schlimme - Embodiment and psychopathology: a phenomenological perspective


- Document Note: The concept of embodiment has become a key paradigm in interdisciplinary approaches related to philosophy, psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience. Embodiment refers to the sensory-motor experience of an organism in relation to its environment. Recent studies and monographs have identified embodiment as a major paradigm of psychopathology, particularly in schizophrenia and depression, where there is a disturbance of the subject body or prereflective embodied sense of self. A phenomenology of embodiment may be combined with enactive approaches to cognitive neuroscience, and ecological concepts of embodiment to enable a new, advanced understanding of mental illness.

## Highlights

> We present the concept of embodiment as a key paradigm of recent interdisciplinary approaches from the areas of philosophy, psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience. This requires a short overview on the phenomenological concept of embodiment; in particular, on the distinction of subject and object body. A psychopathology of embodiment may be based on these and other distinctions, in particular on a polarity of disembodiment and hyperembodiment, which is illustrated by the examples of schizophrenia and depression. Recent contributions to phenomenological accounts of these disorders are presented. Finally, the study discusses the relationship of phenomenological and neuropsychiatric perspectives on embodiment.

> During the last decade, the concept of embodiment has
>  risen to become a key paradigm of interdisciplinary
>  approaches from the areas of philosophy, psychology,

>  based on a remarkable convergence of phenomenology,
>  cognitive science and dynamical systems theory. Since
>  the original work of Varela et al. [1], theories of the
>  embodied and enactive mind have gained considerable
>  inﬂuence on philosophy and cognitive neuroscience [2–
>  5]. Here, embodiment refers not only to the embedding
>  of cognitive processes in brain circuitry but also to the
>  origin of these processes in an organism’s sensory–motor
>  experience in relation to its environment [6 ,7,8]. Neu-
>  roscientists such as Damasio, Edelman, Panksepp and
>  others have emphasized the close connection between
>  brain structures, whole-body functions and aspects of the
>  mind such as consciousness, cognition, emotion and self-
>  awareness. Moreover, social neuroscience as well as social
>  psychology increasingly endorse embodied models of
>  social cognition and behaviour [9–11]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zzbxqjvsxagg0sbzrn0n8j))

- Note: Am reminded of how in AM there's a sense of the self as being observed with love from the outside. As if welcoming the disembodiment. But the paradox is that it's a strong feeling of deep embodiment. As if the alienation (as Fuchs calls it) is a feature and not a bug in AM?
