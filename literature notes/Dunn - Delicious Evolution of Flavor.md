# Rob Dunn - Delicious the Evolution of Flavor and How It Made Us Human

_previous note:_ [[Pollan - In Defence of Food]]

> Why do we eat? In order to pursue the flavor of things. —HSIANG JU LIN AND TSUIFENG LIN[1]

> He meant something more like what we would now call flavor, the sum total of the sensory experience of eating including taste, aroma, mouthfeel, and so much more.

> The English word taste comes from the vulgar Latin tastare, which some dictionaries contend is an alteration of the Latin word taxtare, “to handle or grasp.” This alteration may be due to the influence of the Latin word gustāre, which means to taste. When we taste, we grasp with our tongues.

> We don’t know exactly what the pleasure of encountering such a taste feels like in those other species. We don’t know anything about the experiences of tastes or pleasures in humans other than ourselves. We just assume they are always the same.

> The word “umami” is rooted in the Japanese words for savory (umai) and essence (mi). It also means “a delicious taste and its level of deliciousness,” as well as “a skillful thing to relish, especially in relation to techniques in art.”

> Old world monkeys, apes, and humans are unusual in that their sweet taste receptors do not respond to starch. However, these species produce an enzyme called amylase in their mouths. This amylase does not aid in the digestion of starch (which happens later) but has been hypothesized to break down some of the starch in the mouth so that it can be detected by the sweet taste receptor.

> In his book Catching Fire, the primatologist Richard Wrangham argues that fires and cooking are the defining features of the evolution of the first, ancient humans.

> Wrangham argues that the proximate reason that our ancestors began to use fire was because cooked food is delicious, or at least more delicious than raw food.

> Let’s think about what Wrangham’s idea means for a moment. The use of fire, fire that keeps us warm and lights our way, fire that we have chained inside our ovens so as to heat food in our kitchens, fire that would make way for combustion engines, modern cities, modern war, the internet, and so much else, may have begun because it made food more delicious.

> chapter, the aromas of the meat become much more complex; this complexity may be instinctively pleasing.

> The response of pigs to the aroma of truffles appears to be, at least partially, genetically encoded. Even a very young pig, naïve to the world’s stinks, is drawn to the aromas of truffles.

> We cannot know for sure whether, upon finding a truffle, a pig thinks about sex, food, or some complex feeling in between. We know only that the pig is pleased.

> The pig and dog, for all their differences, both sniff the truffle through their nostrils while it is still outside of their mouth. This experience of the truffle’s aroma is described as orthonasal, in front of (ortho) the nose. Our human experience of truffles includes their orthonasal aromas, but is much more heavily influenced by their retronasal aromas, the aromas that rise up from our mouths into the backs (retro) of our noses.

> Not so for monkeys, apes, and other haplorhine primates. Each bite of their food has a taste and, within their mouth, also an aroma. Together these sensations, along with mouthfeel and a few other bells and whistles, are flavor.

> Once our ancestors discovered how to control fire, they found a way to alter foods, intentionally, so as to favor such complexity, which their brains may have been predisposed to love.

> In cooking, just as in Maillard’s experiments, the mixture of amino acids and sugars under warm conditions produces new compounds. The compounds include pigments that make the surface of foods change texture and color. These are the pigments we see when meats brown, breads crust, or malted barley is baked before brewing. But the process also yields hundreds of other compounds, many of them small enough to be airborne and hence sensed by our noses.

> Every few years new chemical products of this reaction are revealed. It seems likely that they will continue to be revealed for many years to come; fire and fermentation are magicians that hide their best tricks.

> A signal is then sent, an electrochemical message, that lights up a map in your brain. The map is situated on the surface of your olfactory bulb. These maps are literal; they can be seen. They look like arrangements of starbursts, cognitive constellations in which illuminated components of the olfactory bulb shine against a backdrop of darkness.11

> Some of the flavor in cooked meat comes from the protein in the muscles. Muscle flavor derives from the mouthfeel of the muscle combined with the aromas from sulfur compounds in the protein. Unfamiliar meat often “tastes like chicken,” in part because the dominant flavors in chicken are these simple, somewhat bland, muscle flavors. “Tastes like chicken” really means “tastes like muscle.” Muscle flavor is easy to complement with sauces or herbs, or bread batter and oil, but it is relatively nondescript on its own.12

> It can also true of horses. Their meat is flavored by what Guy de Maupassant called the “quintessence of all the food that (they have) consumed.”[103] They have a terroir, a flavor of the land and the time and the place in which they have lived and been killed, a flavor rich in details, history, and context.

> The goodness of fruits is buried in our language. If something pays off, it is fruitful. If it pays off without much investment, it is a windfall (of fruit). If it doesn’t pay off, it is fruitless. If something wonderful is easy to obtain, its fruit is low-hanging.

> On many of these leaves one finds small, plump spheres in which the plant stores chemicals; when the spheres burst like small bombs, as in our mouths or when we cut or tear the leaves, the chemicals rise explosively into the air.

> Many species and varieties of thyme (Thymus) grow wild throughout the Mediterranean. Different varieties of thyme produce different defensive aromas. Often, the variety on one hill produces a different aroma from that on a nearby hill. These differences, from one hill to the next, have been shown to be partially determined by which herbivore, or other enemy, is most abundant.

> Similarly, thyme basil,3 which also grows in the Mediterranean, produces much less of its most aromatic compounds when growing in areas that are inaccessible to goats and sheep. It offers less warning when there is no one to warn. Based on these and other observations, some scientists have gone so far as to suggest that the aromas of plants in the Mediterranean and Middle East are an effect of the thousands of years of herbivory by goats and sheep. The species and varieties that are left are those that were most strongly defended.[133] The most geographically widespread thyme in Europe today, for example, is the variety that has the strongest chemical deterrents.[134]

> The leaf of a mint. The large deflated spheres on the surface of the leaf are the small containers in which the plant, like most herbs, keeps its chemical weapons. The contents of these containers are released when the leaf is bitten, torn, or crushed.

> We have a bitter taste receptor, for instance, that tells us to avoid plants with strychnine, another that tells us to avoid caffeine.

> To employ a spice is to ignore nature’s admonishments. We humans intentionally gather plants with high concentrations of defensive chemicals or warning aromas and add them to our food, typically in small doses.

> The fragrant aromas of garlic, mint, thyme, and dill are warnings of the existence of poisons.

> Nature tells animals, such as humans, to trust their mothers and the aromas associated with what they have eaten. In the small communities of our ancestors, the aromas associated with mothers’ foods tended to be, with a few exceptions, the aromas associated with the food of the broader community.

> Humans can learn to dislike an aroma in a single event if that aroma, for example, is associated with vomiting (a phenomenon known as the Garcia effect).

> In one model of the history of food, a model first advocated by the botanist Jonathan Sauer, the first species domesticated by humans were the microbes used in making sour beer and sourdough bread. Then, once those microbes were domesticated, humans found themselves in need of a more reliable source of fodder for those microbes. Then, and only then, they began to domesticate grains in order to feed the microbes in order to make beer. In this telling, microbes are central and crops are secondary.[

> Fermentation is rot. The global food safety system is built around controlling rot. Foods that rot the wrong way can be very dangerous. Foods that rot the right way (from a human perspective) yield beer, bread, kombucha, and ham.

> The acid in rotten foods, whether they are meats or fruits, is produced by one of two groups of bacteria, either lactic acid bacteria (which produce lactic acid) or acetic acid bacteria (which produce acetic acid). Both lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria produce acid as a defense in order to kill off their competition. The species with which these bacteria compete include the species that are dangerous to mammals. As a result, acidic foods are almost always free of pathogens. This reality, long understood by people who make sourdough bread, pickles, or sour beer, led Katie to posit that perhaps primates might use sour taste as a way to distinguish good rot from dangerous rot.

> Yeasts eat sugar. They do so by converting one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) to two molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and two molecules of ethanol (C2H5OH), aka alcohol of the sort found in cider, beer, and wine. This biochemical magic generates energy for the yeast. The ethanol is then excreted from the yeast cells as waste. Yes, your booze is fungal feces. But it needn’t be. Yeasts can actually get more energy from nectar or fruits if they don’t produce ethanol and instead break down the sugar more completely. So why produce ethanol? Just as bacteria produce acid to kill other bacteria and yeasts, yeasts produce alcohol to kill bacteria.[160]

> Cabrales is consistently ranked among the best cheeses in the world because of its flavors, complexities, and the work required to yield them. Yet it is hard to say why it exists. Why did a people in a small valley in northern Spain, a valley in which life has, at most points during the last thousand years, been hard and humble, decide to make such a cheese in the first place? The simple answer is that the cheese is a way to store milk for consumption during the hard months when the cows, sheep, and goats are not nursing (and so not producing milk). In this, the cheese is not so different from fermented fish. Cheese buffered hard times. It was a dietary necessity.

> The most ancient of these hard and flavorful cheeses included cheeses similar to Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (aka parmesan), Manchego, Asiago, and Gouda. Such cheeses can be very different from each other6 and yet are produced using similar processes and are united in their durability, their hardness. The first evidence of these cheeses comes from metal cheese graters found in southern Italy (around what is now Naples) as early as 700 BCE. Southern Italians have been shredding parmesan-like cheese on their food for no fewer than 2700 years.

> Food and language are not only close neighbors … they occupy the same house. —GORDON SHEPHERD

> We sat between the British artist Alvin Booth, who specializes in photographs of bits and pieces of the bodies of nude dancers, and a shepherd who still smelled faintly of sheep (an aroma that we can tell you, thanks to the reading we’ve done while writing this book, is due in part to the scent of capric acid).

> It has been known for a while that chimpanzees produce extra oxytocin when grooming or being groomed. Wittig and his colleagues were able to show that sharing or receiving food triggers an even larger increase in oxytocin (at least as measured by the concentrations present in urine), particularly if the food is hard to obtain.[182] This was true if the chimpanzees were sharing with friends. It was also true if the chimpanzees were sharing with animals they wanted to be their friends.

> As a result, while the rules of dining vary in many ways among cultures, the importance of eating together transcends human culture and time. And this togetherness improves the deliciousness of food; it improves it through the pleasure of companionship and the pleasure of stories.

> For many thousands of years, fireside gatherings were where our ancestors shared stories. It was around fires, with food in hand, that our ancestors communicated their knowledge and understanding. It was in such gatherings that truth could be sorted from falsehoods. Fireside chats were long our system of peer review and consensus building; they were the first universities, scientific societies, kitchens, and dining rooms all in one.

> Homo sapiens, the name of our species, is often said to mean “knowing” (sapiens) “human” (Homo). But sapiens originates in a verb meaning “to taste” and later “to have discernment.” One might then also read the name of our species as the human (Homo) who discerns through taste (sapiens) or flavors. We discern and choose through flavors, but we also search, research, and learn by tasting, and are uniquely suited to doing so together with others of our species, whether around a fire or at a table. We sit together and make sense of the world one bite at a time.7
