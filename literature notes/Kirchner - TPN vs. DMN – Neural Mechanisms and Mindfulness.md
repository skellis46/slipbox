# Blair Kirchner - TPN vs. DMN – Neural Mechanisms and Mindfulness

_previous note:_ [[DMN]]

> As Stephen Batchelor put it in a somewhat provocative fashion: “[Mindfulness] is not concerned with anything transcendent or divine. It serves as an antidote to theism, a cure for sentimental piety, a scalpel for excising the tumor of metaphysical belief.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9sxdgr7em60aq13p9bs5m3e))

> It’s called “default” because it is the network that is activated unless we are specifically engaged in task specific activity. In other words, you are not attending to physical activity, interacting with the world around you, or involved in a dialogue. Examples of some other components of default mode network (DMN) include: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9sxf49s2w0nt9kaxp96v7f6))

> • Mind-wandering – ‘monkey mind’
> • Self-referencing helping us shape our view of ‘who we are’
> • Imagining the future
> • Understanding others – theory of mind
> • Long term memory
> • Reliving the past, or general rumination – day dreaming ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9sxfnt4gghj5d3q9jw4mq1x))


> “*In your mind isn’t clouded by unnecessary things. This is the best season of your life.*” *– Wu-Men* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9sxqmky26spgqt3ydbnn3qp))


> **Task Positive Network**
>  *“Only that day dawns to which we are awake.” – Henry David Thoreau, Walden*
>  The TPN is active during ‘attention-demanding’ tasks and includes our conscious attention towards the external environment. This happens through our various senses, towards our internal condition, and to the intentional execution of physical and mental action.
>  Additional components of the TPN include:
>  • Task orientation
>  • Process sensory input
>  • Short term memory
>  • Abstract thought ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9sxrnbv7axhmea87b0n883p))

> “Imagine that you are sitting down to meditate. You rest yourself comfortably on your meditation cushion and straighten your back. Your mind is still operating on the DMN as you relive a conversation from earlier in the day or worry about a project that is due at the end of the week. But then you engage the lPFC/Director and activate the TPN, silencing the DMN.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9sy0vme5r44yxjfrf7zq6vq))

> According to [Good at Task, Bad at People?](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-fundamental-four/201406/good-task-bad-people) By Sandeep Gautam:
>  “One good way to think about the difference between the TPN and the DMN is to think of the TPN as specialized for mechanistic, analytical and reasoning based interactions; while the DMN is specialized for mentalistic, empathetic and self and other referential social interactions.”
>  Neither is the TPN “good” nor the DMN “bad” however the balance between the two is a dynamic relationship.
>  • The networks span both hemispheres
>  • A key phenomenon is that they are counter to each other. Activation of one inhibits the other.
>  1. A good analogy would be the inhale – exhale cycle
>  • Interestingly, sociopaths have the capability to have both the networks activated simultaneously
>  • DMN is fine until we use it to ruminate, self-blame, or worry.
>  1. An evolutionary tool that helped us plan and learn from past experience became overkill with increased mental capabilities. Arguably a case of too much of a good thing? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9syfb6r5mgd3n7dhdmp8t4t))
