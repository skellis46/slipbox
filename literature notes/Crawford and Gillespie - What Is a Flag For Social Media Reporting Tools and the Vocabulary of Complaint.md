- URL: https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/79255412


> “Flagging”—a mechanism for reporting offensive content to a social media plat-
>  form—is found on nearly all sites that host user-generated content ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7j2egh1vs1ygr37pdjd6ear))

> But a
>  flag is not merely a technical feature: It is a complex interplay between users and plat-
>  forms, humans and algorithms, and the social norms and regulatory structures of social
>  media. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7j2f3vqsbf5m8adtytn8m23))

> This is doubly meaningful, given that most governments claim enormous diffi-
>  culty regulating the activities of large social media sites, and these services excel at
>  exceeding traditional state boundaries, policy frameworks, and technical means for pre-
>  release content-rating systems. As yet, no national or international body seems able to
>  selectively monitor and regulate such volumes of content in real time (Crawford and
>  Lumby, 2013). Thus, flags are a practical and symbolic linchpin in maintaining a system
>  of self-regulation (Price and Verhulst, 2005; Verhulst, 2010)—and avoiding government
>  oversight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7j2pwj3xhvnwv3ha0688wv1))

> . This logic of “datafication” (Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier, 2013) poses its
>  own dilemmas, codifying complaints as a legible regime of feeling, and using it to tap
>  into otherwise undetectable patterns of user sentiment (Andrejevic, 2013). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7j2rm5t9gme909anetcamjv))
