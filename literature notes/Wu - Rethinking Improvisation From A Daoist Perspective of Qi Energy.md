# I-Ying Wu - Rethinking Improvisation From A Daoist Perspective of Qi Energy

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM summary:

Wu’s chapter proposes a Daoist rethinking of dance improvisation by foregrounding qi as the central organising concept. She critiques dominant Western accounts of improvisation that emphasise intention, choice, creativity and individual agency, arguing that these frameworks misrepresent how movement actually arises in practice. Drawing on Daoist philosophy, Wu presents qi not as a mystical energy or internal force but as a relational, processual dynamic that circulates between bodies, environments and situations. Improvisation, from this view, is not the dancer expressing inner states or making moment-to-moment decisions, but a practice of attunement to ongoing transformations. Skill is reframed as the ability to sense, follow and align with these transformations rather than to control or invent movement

The chapter contrasts Daoist notions such as wuwei (non-forcing) with Western models of authorship and mastery, arguing that improvisation grounded in qi destabilises binaries such as mind/body, subject/object and active/passive. Wu stresses that this perspective does not reject training or discipline, but understands them as ways of refining perceptual sensitivity and ethical responsiveness rather than asserting control. She also cautions against superficial appropriations of Daoism, emphasising that qi should not be reduced to metaphor or exotic philosophy. Instead, Daoist thought is offered as a coherent alternative conceptual framework that repositions improvisation as emergent, relational and continuously unfolding, challenging conventional assumptions about agency, creativity and ownership in dance practice
