# McFall-Ngai - Noticing Microbial Worlds: The Postmodern Synthesis in Biology

_previous note:_

> The cells of the mother infiltrate across the placenta into the child, and the cells of the child infiltrate into the mother. Thus each one of us is a chimera of sorts, our bodies containing cell lines of others. If you are a first-born child, you will have a set of cells that come from your mother, including cells that she acquired from her own mother in the same way. If you are a youngest child, not only will you receive your mother’s cells, but you will also receive all of your siblings’ cells. We are thus not what we thought: every “I” is also a “we.” And, while the preceding example is highly illustrative, our bodies are not only—not even primarily—composed of cells from our close kin. Indeed, we are more microbe than human. Our fundamental microbial-ness is at the heart of this essay—and it is precisely what the genomics revolution is allowing us to notice.[@mcfall-ngai-2017-noticing p.M52]

> The genomics revolution is, in large part, a technical one. New technologies are changing our ideas about the relationship between the micro and macro worlds by changing what we can see. Our understanding of (m52) the biological world has always been fundamentally linked to how we are able to perceive it, and what we can perceive is tied to the technologies we have for seeing. This has always been the case.[@mcfall-ngai-2017-noticing p.M53]

> Human bodies can no longer be seen as fortresses to defend against microbial onslaught but must be reenvisioned as nested ecosystems.[@mcfall-ngai-2017-noticing p.M65]
