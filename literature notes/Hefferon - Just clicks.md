# Hefferon - ‘Just clicks’: an interpretive phenomenological analysis of professional dancers’ experience of flow

_previous note:_ [[Bergamin - Being-in-the-flow]]

Included here as placeholder for a highly cited article on studying [[flow]] in dance.

> Another facet of flow is loss of self-consciousness, which aligns with the idea that external focusing helps avoid a preoccupation with the self (Wulf & Lewthwaits, 2010). Said a dancer in another flow study: "I couldn't say that I am conscious of my thoughts. I am just enjoying the purity of the movement and how it felt for me" [@hefferon-2006-just p.150] 

## LLM summary

> This study explored how professional dancers experience flow using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Nine dancers from ballet, contemporary, jazz, Irish and Canadian styles described moments when performance ‘just clicks’. Three main themes emerged: intrinsic enjoyment (autotelic experience), balance between challenge and skill, and total absorption in the task. Dancers reported that confidence, music, choreography, stage familiarity, costumes, pre-performance routines and supportive social environments facilitated flow, while stress, boredom, negative feedback and poor stage conditions inhibited it. Flow was described as intense focus, loss of self-consciousness and altered time perception. The study suggests that cultivating confidence, optimal challenge and positive conditions can enhance dancers’ potential for peak performance.
