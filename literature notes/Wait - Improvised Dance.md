# Nalina Wait - Improvised Dance

_previous note:_


> By favouring the term “body-mind,” this book follows Martha Eddy in distinguishing between the practices she describes as either “mind-body” or “body-mind” by describing the latter as “the physical portal to a holistic paradigm of consciousness” and the former as those, such as meditation, which “direct the mind to notice the body, or otherwise influence the body especially to ‘quiet it.’ This is in contrast to somatic awareness ... [that] uses tools to find meaning from these sensations, contextualising them within a whole body perspective.” [@wait-2023-improvised p.13]
- footnote 80. Eddy, Mindful Movement, 12.

some thoughts about this idea:
- continuation of duality
- meditation isn't necessarily about quieting. 
- curious about 'directing the mind' -- not if consciousness seen as field of awareness (or as a matter of direct experience)
- "find meaning" seems odd -- perhaps in therapeutic sense
- "whole body" -- just tipping the scales such that body becomes the 'main thing'


> However, in utilising these concepts, it is important to highlight that there is potential for an improviser working with these methods to become completely saturated, or immersed in the resonance of affects in circulation, rather than cultivating a state of detached equanimity as suggested both by Eastern philosophy and Spinoza.90 [@wait-2023-improvised p.15]

- not sure what 'concepts' Wait means. Probably Eastern meditation techniques

> This book, therefore, focuses on naming, describing, and identifying what is specific to states of conscious awareness in order to elucidate the process of how improvisation is composed by both corporeal knowledges and incorporeal forces. Importantly for dance pedagogy, these questions are asked not through cognitive science but through aesthetics, poetics, and language-making that emerge from a radically anti-Cartesian perspective. Investigating the operation of somatic intelligence and its effect on the composition of improvised dance through case studies and my own practice requires re-imagining the models for language and other tools used to teach improvised compositional dance theory. [@wait-2023-improvised p.15]

> While theory cannot replace practice, it can make specific details of practice more accessible to a wider audience of professional performers and educators, including those operating outside of dance. Offering non-dancers insights into the ways in which improvisers develop expertise within their discipline may increase accessibility and an appreciation for specialised (in)corporeal knowledges of improvised dance. In this way, improvisation as a practice can be revealed as a precursor to many of the new mindfulness theories that are currently gaining traction in the field of neuroscience, which demonstrate how practice can lead the way in the humanities-science interface. Most importantly, as (in)corporeal knowledges are disseminated through direct body-to-body presence, live, in real-time, dance educators need to pay special attention to the development of pedagogical models that can circumvent the dualism inherent in language.
