# Stevens - The Hungry Ghost Bread Book

_previous note:_ [[breaking bread]]

This ritual, this reenactment, is not merely symbolic. The elements are real, the nourishment is physical—the war against hunger is not theater. The building blocks of true civilization, flour and clean running water and village hearths, are part of our inheritance, but they must be respected and put to constant use. Renewed. Rituals become empty when their meanings are forgotten, their movements become mere gestures, their medicines too weak for our newfangled dis-eases.


Wheat naturally contains phytic acids, which impair nutrient absorption, but fermentation (inoculation with wild yeast and bacteria) actually neutralizes this food inhibitor. Yet another reason why the old revolution (Neolithic) has better principles than the new one (be it the Industrial or the Technological). This is absolutely crucial to understand: sourdough bread is not merely a “style” of bread. It is bread. That other stuff—yeasted bread and “straight” dough—that stuff may look like bread, and to some it may even taste like bread, but it is not truly digestible.


It is perhaps in our role as “wild yeast farmers” (as one agriculturalist friend puts it) that bakers really make their mark.


Because context is everything: bread is a social phenomenon as much as a culinary one. Before the Neolithic Revolution, food was shared strictly within a tight kin structure around the campfire or in a tent. Since the Dot-Com Revolution, most food is gobbled from take-out containers in front of glowing screens. In our version of events, friends and strangers alike are invited to take part in the economy of baking.


Too much of the mythology of bread baking has an individualistic bent to it, a pioneering “I did it all myself” sort of image. But even if you could farm the land yourself, harvest the wheat alone, and then mill it and somehow find time to bake it off, you would still need other people to buy it and eat it, let alone build the tractor you used or sell you the seed or play the music you listened to all along the way.


MORE HYDRATION, MORE FERMENTATION, MORE HEAT IN THE OVEN!


Almost all the bread I come across, in bakeries and in books, is underhydrated, underfermented, and underbaked. Why? Because it’s easier to handle, because blasting steam at an underproofed loaf makes it “pop” in a sexy way, and because people are afraid of pushing the envelope. Don’t be afraid: the worst than can happen (and it will!) is a mess of dough.


As good as it might be, a loaf can be appreciated only in its obliteration. It is made to be eaten, “translated” into eater. It does a baker good to be rid of their loaves. 


For the recipes in this book, the ideal configuration is a half-size pan—roughly 12 × 10 inches (30.5 × 25.4 cm) and 4 inches (10 cm) deep.

A starter (aka leaven, biga, poolish, chef, Mother) is a symbiotic community of wild yeasts and Lactobacilli maintained in a medium of wheat flour and water.


The wild yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewer’s yeast), are single-cell fungi that are all around us.


The bacteria, such as the famously named Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, are more adapted to specific environments. These are the predigesters of the dough, the carbon dioxide expellers, the tiny magicians that ferment our mixes and prepare them to be baked into actual food.


Why do we leaven the dough with this difficult, challenging, demanding stuff? Because it gives us healthy bread, since only natural fermentation neutralizes the phytic acids that occur in wheat, rendering it more digestible to humans.


“Straight dough,” or bread leavened with anything besides what we call sourdough, can smell like and taste sort of like bread, but it will never be digested in the same way.


My mantra, if you haven’t heard already, is that sourdough bread is not a “style” of bread: it is real bread, and has been for over 10,000 years.


Each time you refresh the starter, the microbes start busily consuming flour to sustain themselves. The yeast in particular, but also the bacteria, produce carbon dioxide as one of the by-products of their metabolism. The tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide cause the starter to expand in its container. The bacteria are also producing the compounds responsible for the tangy flavors of sourdough, including lactic acid (also found in yogurt) and, to a lesser extent, acetic acid (also found in vinegar). After a while, as these organic acids and other by-products build up in the starter, they begin to inhibit the growth of the microbes. As a result, the expansion of the starter in the container reaches a plateau. After the plateau period, if no refreshment is forthcoming, the microbes become dormant and even begin to die. The starter continues to fall as carbon dioxide slowly escapes and is not replaced by further metabolism.


Simply put, the baker’s percentage system states that the total flour used is expressed as 100 percent, and any other ingredient is referred to in relation to that amount.


There’s an outer shell of bran, a white starchy endosperm, and at its center, the germ. If stored in a cool, dry place, it is remarkably stable and can last a long time without spoiling. The gravest danger is generally vermin, hence the high status of cats in Egyptian mythology, protectors of the precious harvest.


Bran is full of minerals, particularly iron (hence the reddish-brown color), which is why it can be bitter and why white flour is sweeter. The naturally occurring glucose is made more available in white flour, and this allows for the caramelization of the crust. We can’t get a crunchy crust on a whole wheat loaf, and that is why.


Even the Romans had the technology to sift flour and remove the large bran. They used a bolt of loose fabric to do it, and hence we have “bolted” flour. It retains all of the germ, all of the endosperm, and most, but not all, of the bran.

The first time you make a particular recipe, take the extra step of oiling the surface of the dough hook with olive oil, including the dough guard near the top of the hook. Oiling the hook helps prevent the phenomenon of “dough climb,” which is described below.


There are two temperatures that determine the time needed for bulk fermentation: the dough temperature at the start of bulk fermentation (final dough temperature) and the air temperature while bulk fermentation takes place (ambient temperature). If the ambient temperature differs from the dough temperature, then the dough temperature will drift toward the ambient temperature as bulk fermentation proceeds. The metabolic activity of bacteria and yeast does generate a small amount of heat within the dough, but the quantity of heat produced is small, especially during the earlier hours of bulk fermentation.


The small dough in your kitchen has a much lower thermal mass, so it cools down more and takes longer to ferment.


The driving principle behind the bread at Hungry Ghost is pushing the envelope in terms of hydration, fermentation, and gelatinization. That means more water in the dough while mixing, more bubbles in the dough while shaping, and more time in a hotter oven when baking.


One way to describe our approach is to handle the dough without actually touching it too much. Or at least, never too long in any one spot. Our hands have grown accustomed to spinning the dough in place on the work surface, first across the outer palm and then each fingertip in quick succession.


The table is your third hand, an anchor allowing you to create tension in the skin of the dough and stretch it smooth. Imagine that you’re winding a coiled spring. Don’t lift it off the table and don’t douse it with flour (though your fingers might use just a touch). Tuck it down under and turn. Doesn’t matter whether it’s clockwise or counterclockwise, as long as it’s in one consistent direction. Rather than grabbing and overhandling it, coax it into a sphere, a little planet of dough.


When warm dough goes into the refrigerator, it continues to ferment as it cools, albeit slowly. With a starting temperature of 78°F (25.5°C), the center of a typical round loaf reaches 65°F (18.5°C) after about 3 hours in our fridge, 50°F (10°C) after about 7 hours, and 42°F (5.5°C) after about 12 hours. Once the dough reaches that low temperature, any additional time is basically holding the dough until it’s a convenient time to bake.


In the bakery, our doughs are retarded for 15 to 24 hours. That’s a long trajectory. At home, 12 to 18 hours is appropriate. Your lower fridge temp means there’s less chance of overproofing, but also more time needed (1 or 2 hours) to bring the dough up to room temperature before baking.


To prepare for loading the oven, dust the top surface of the dough (which will become the bottom of the loaf) with semolina or with a 50-50 mixture of all-purpose flour and white rice flour.


Then give thanks to Hestia, goddess of the hearth.


It’s pronounced “foo-GAS,” has nothing to do with the punk band from DC (Fugazi), is a derivative of the Latin word _focus_ (which means _hearth_, the focus of any home), and is the French cousin of focaccia.
