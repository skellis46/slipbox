## Transcript

I suspect … prayers, in order to be prayers and not petitions for more have to include two things. One of them is  
that you're making supplication. So there is in it a confession. Of lack or error or worse. And an acknowledgement of the inability to be self sufficient probably has to be in there too.

Now, content wise, what's a mature prayer? That's a really tricky question. Do you pray that people wise up? Do you pray, in the teeth of the shit show of the way it is, do you pray that it's not this way when it friggin is this way? And it being this way is what prompted you to pray in the first place?

Let's check on everybody else.  
Boss man!  
There you are.  
Let's go put the water on for the coffee first.

I've never heard a better prayer.  
It's remarkable for its candor, its brevity and what's not in it.  
And the prayer went like this.  
God.  
Help me.  
My boat is so small.  
And your sea so immense.

What's missing in that prayer?  
It's not missing. This is what makes it prayerful.  
It's not saying: "Would you please fix the ratios."  
"So my boat is not so small and your sea not nearly as immense."  
Which of course is what the internet is exactly about.  
And Artificial Intelligens is exactly about that.  
Making the sea smaller and the boat bigger.  
But in this prayer there's no attempt to rejig the ratios.  
It's just case making. It's not complaining.  
It's not cursing.  
It's fucking amazing. How it withholds its grievance card.  
And just says: "Dude."  
"It's hard. Help me."

16 little beautiful ducklings.  
You like that new coop, right?  
I like it too.  
Let's go this way today.  
Yeah, you'll find them.  
Oh, let's get some hay.

You know the …  
The ground is still. But I don't think it's silent.  
I think it murmurs.

We are in a time not quite of utter present hour collapse.  
But we can see it from here.  
What's worth doing given that?

> If you see yourself in this moment as the intended and unintended consequence of things that were undertaken and decided and aborted, seven generations ago. You see yourself mostly as consequence, not agent. How did you happen? Not just your look, your disposition. But the whole crazy thing that coalesced for the moment and turned into you. How many threads, fibers and fractals? If you can do that, you're in the game now I think. But this requires you have a conscious span of fourteen generations, not seven. And you're a conduit for the back and forth rush between them all. That's how you figure out what you should do, I think.

Mmm, there's butter in there. What else did you put in there?  
Mud.

We have the origin of the word "windfall" here.  
Since yesterday this one fell.  
The perfection of apples in the northern climate  
is something to behold, no?  
So, I'm not saying that the tree is here for me exactly.  
That would be a fit of real, genuine caprice I think.  
I'm just saying that for a while we're here together.  
And I've done my part to save the tree from  
the predations of the deer in the wintertime.  
And the limitations of the sand beneath here.  
And I imagine in some kind of strange exchange  
against the odds, the tree bears fruit and I bear witness.  
So, I love that these are signs, you know.  
That we haven't entirely blown it.  
Also it's a very good year. Those things happen. Good years happen.

I've been thinking about today. For a while now.  
I've been watching these birds come in and out.  
Here's that little rose bed that I started. Some of them have survived.  
Wow, look at you!  
I'm just thinking about that big road corn has taken over time.  
Teosinte, maize.  
… all the way from the south, over the mountains, around lakes.

- Are you sure they're ready?
- The birds are at them.  
The birds are at them pretty good. But these ones are dry, see?  
They won't all be ready, but …  
Can you take this one?  
I have to admit I resent severely the birds taking what I think is more than their portion.  
I mean severely.  
I feel strangely paternally protective of the corn.  
I can't figure that out.  
I don't feel that way about a zucchini.  
But corn, roughly the same shape, that's what it does to me.  
So there it is. You bitch, you moan, you groan. You're full of spite.  
And you feel chided by the thing that's around you. That you chose.  
And some part of you, hopefully, eventually, quiets down enough to say:  
"And that's the way it is."  
Let me put them in your arms. Here we have some huitlacoche.
- Where's the basket?
- Kaz has one.

"Crisis", the word, is full of warning signs now.  
So, we use it as a fait accompli disaster.  
But for most of its syntactical lifetime, it didn't mean that at all.  
In fact, our feelings about it weren't a big part of the meaning of the word "crisis".  
That's all they are now.  
So you can tell from the word, you can hear the word "cross", "critical".  
You know that there's a sense of moment  
that's visited itself upon a particular place and time.  
Apparently with a sense of urgency or adamance.  
And it says the time for choosing is at hand.  
You may refuse to choose and in so doing, choose.  
The hour is upon you, and  
you don't get a vote about that.  
You do however get a vote on how  
you shall be now that that is so.  
Which is basically the meaning of the word "fate".  
"Fate" means the Gods have spoken, that's what the world is.  
What shall you do, now that they have done so?

> I don't know if a piece of land is understandable. I think the ultimate defeat of your intent to understand it, is the understanding. That's why it's important. Because it's bigger than you, no matter how small it is. And ultimately your capacity to be grateful for being alive is rooted in the fact that everything is bigger than you.

Even this barn behind me here is a temple to what I'm talking about now.  
You know, it's 120 years old, give or take.  
And it's been on this site a year.  
Two years ago I caught wind of  
the fact that the current owners  
have decided on summer  
homes for all on that farm.  
No more farm.  
No more farm buildings as a result.  
I got in touch with the guy  
who'd been contracted to  
take them all down and dispose of them.  
I went over and chose amongst the farm  
buildings the one most likely to survive  
disassembly and reassembly here on my farm.  
In the process of taking them apart  
I found the names of three  
of the makers of the barn.  
This was a living thing.  
And it derives from the days  
when people knew how to do it.  
Almost nobody knows how to do that.  
A lot of people knew how to do it not that long ago.  
They're all dead.  
Most of their work is "dead and in the dust" too.  
But this one isn't.  
And I consider myself really lucky to have been put in the position of operating as if, some generations ago,  
people built something that they hoped would work, and therefore last. And I'm in the conduit of seeing  
to it that they weren't wrong. 

You can't get this kind of agrarian equivalent of stained glass light many places.  
But this for me is the  
stained glass light of a cathedral.  
And I'm a cathedral's janitor,  
not the high priest.  
And if you can see these things for what they are  
you get a chance of …  
at the end of a long day  
you could say: "Not so bad."  
And that's plenty.  
"Not so bad" is plenty.
