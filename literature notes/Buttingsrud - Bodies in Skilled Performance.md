# Buttingsrud (Camille) – Bodies in Skilled Performance: How Dancers Reflect through the Living Body

_previous note:_

This article is vital for [[losing oneself]] and covers a lot of overlapping material but with a very different emphasis. Note that there's also some notes in Notion when I am ready to transfer those. It's also not clear whether there is any distinction between [[flow]] states and what Buttingsrud calls a "bodily reflective state" (which is the same as 'embodied reflection'??). See footnote 11 at bottom of p.7541.

> When asked, they reveal an overwhelming insight regarding the bodily subject, an insight that may not fit traditional and canonical scholarly under- standings of consciousness, cognition, and embodiment, but that can potentially expand academic understanding of what being a human being amounts to. [@buttingsrud-2021-bodies p.7536]

> An experience that is familiar to dancers--as well as to artists in other fields, and athletes, soldiers, and others focused on bodily and affective activities--is largely overlooked in philosophical theories of cognition and consciousness: that is, our common human ability to reflect non-conceptually through bodily and/or affective activity. p.7536

- I don't know what she means by non-conceptually (covers it later)

> The dancers I've interviewed for the empirical research tell me how they aim at "letting go of (conceptual) thinking" while working. Doing so, they experience a "bodily freedom" that gives room for "meaningfulness, where it all connects", and where one "understands without judging". This bodily and affective attentiveness is experienced as "profound contemplation". Dancing can be a way of making sense of life, a way of thinking (bodily) without thinking (conceptually). As one interviewee, Eleanor, insightfully puts it: "Dance is a medium of non-representational thought". My own first-person experiences as a performer3 align with these descriptions. p.7537

> I argue that the phenomenon of bodily sense making constitutes a state of consciousness in its own right. p.7537 
- here's where it differs from ND: "state of consciousness" as if somehow there's a special mode, and it's something to be attained or reached for.

> What the dancers have reported, though, is that they mainly focus bodily during their work, and aim at not engaging in mind-based reflections. They enter their professional room of attention by means of their bodily and affective faculties. This experience of consciousness, which I call "embodied reflection", is not described in the traditional, phenomenological literature on consciousness. p.7539

> What the dancers describe, though, is a bodily directedness that is both deliberate and immediate, which, seemingly effortlessly, encompasses various facets of the situation simultaneously. As we have seen, a dancer's consciousness can be directed towards the whole body, bodily feelings, the environment, and movements in the environment--all simultaneously. The attention of this bodily reflective state embraces the whole context of the activity. This form of bodily intentionality is not only multifaceted, but seems altogether different from what we know from established philosophical theories. It does not have the directedness conceptual reflection has towards its object of reflection, where the attention moves like a pointing finger towards the object, and narrows the field of focus down to one specific end. Neither does this bodily intentionality work on a pre-reflective level as our motoricity does--it is far too attentive, fine-tuned, and deliberate to fit that description. p.7541

> Several times during our interviews Ole mentions the freedom he experiences being in flow while dancing.11 He sees it as a break from everyday stress: "There is so much control everywhere else". "All of a sudden one can let go and enter this completely different room." He always enters this room of consciousness when he works, but his consciousness is not permanently on that level throughout the whole workday. Getting there is a process, and it has a lot to do with the setting he is in. Dancing with someone who also easily "lets go", like his dance partner Antoinette, helps. "It's not a switch I turn on. But we know each other well, we've done this several times, and we know how to get there". He describes how the two of them start out by just moving around for a while, "and then all of a sudden it's there". p.7541

> The dancers and other artists, who've helped me in my research so far, have all told me about the variety of modes of consciousness experienced through their workdays. When I stress the bodily reflective level, it is because it seems to be the favoured state of consciousness in any performance or creative situation, and because it is in need of structured philosophical elucidation. p.7543

- but how much does thinking occur? how much does judgement (or discernment) occur? 
- see also my comments in Notion

> Embodied reflection is experienced with the same immediacy as pre-reflective consciousness. The field of immediate presence is considerably enlarged, though. Ole puts it this way: "One's consciousness expands. Sometimes it feels as if it enfolds the whole universe. It's not as if you see the stars and the moon, but there's a feeling of complete expansion." p.7545

> "Letting go", which seems to be a kind of mantra to dancers, is not just a question of switching off the conceptual mind. It is an expression that covers the deliberate action of stopping flows of irrelevant thoughts and judgements, and everyday worries and hustles. This means, as mentioned, that private emotional states are also put aside during work hours. There is a twofold bodily-affective decision-making going [p.7546] on in the dancer here--a decision to let go of parts of one's self, and a decision to fully open other parts of oneself. pp.7545-7546

- note here the language of 'stopping' (as if that is possible)

> To Eleanor, thinking through dancing is not representational. "It's not referring to the thing, I am being the thing. I'm becoming the thing. (As a dancer) you're really not trying to show or represent those things as objects or forms." "I am in the actual situation." p.7546
- who is the "I" here? What is the thing? (so different from 'no-thing' in Losing Oneself)

> When a dancer is in the wholeness-directed mode, the experience of wholeness and connectedness might comprise their living body and its movements, or them- selves and their co-dancers, or the dancers and the musicians on stage, or the people on stage and their audience, or--as we have heard from Ole--it might comprise the dancing situation and the whole universe. Something definitely happens to the "I" of the bodily reflective dancer, and we shall take a closer look at that in the next section. p.7547

> Antoinette's absorbed work mode has, then, been replaced with the experience of seeing herself as she imagines her audience sees her. The latter is what Sartre describes as "the third ontological dimension of the body". The first and second dimensions of the body are the body-for-me and the body-for-others, which are both direct perceptions of existence. The third way of experiencing one's own bodily existence is the objectification of oneself through the eyes of the other, where I "exist for myself as a body known by the other" (Sartre, 2003, p. 460). p.7548
- wow. body for me and body for others are already super weird ... 

> In the expertise debate, many talk of "self-forgetfulness" in skilful performance (Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986). To them, the forgotten self must be the self that is identified with the conceptually reflective mind. The dancers I have interviewed do not feel that their selves are forgotten when they are immersed in bodily activity. On the contrary, it is having involuntary conceptual thoughts while dancing that can give them the feeling of forgetting or losing themselves. This form of conceptual thinking interferes with the flow in embodied reflection. It delays the dancer and disturbs her sense of immediate presence, hence the experience of losing touch with oneself. p.7548
- does one ever not have involuntary conceptual thoughts? 
- this is so fascinating -- feels kind of backwards and I'm not sure what to make of it.

> In the state of consciousness I aim at describing, embodied reflection, the bodily concentrated subject has let go of conceptual reflection, and is fully focused through and absorbed in the bodily and/or affective activity one is performing. As we have seen it in the interviewed dancers' descriptions, as a dancer one might search for this state of absorption, because it frees one as a body to do one's dance work without delay and interruption, and because it allows one to go deeper into one's bodily and affective intelligence and make full use of these capacities in one's work. p.7549
- "bodily concentrated subject" -- subject! it's very strange language (perhaps because it's really philosophy?)
- note also the dancer's 'search' (or reaching?) for this 'state'. I'm not sure the phenomenology is different from NDA, but certainly the language around it. 

- gives useful overview of Husserl vis a vis reflection and consciousness

"A bodily reflecting dancer grasps material from her stream of experience" - p.7549
- note the agency implied here. Who is doing the grasping and where (and how) is that grasping manifest? 
- Merleau-Ponty describes 'thinking in painting' -- but why thinking? How different from Sheets-Johnstone (thinking in movement)? 

> Summing up so far, the bodily reflecting dancing self is a subject who has let go of conceptual thoughts as well as of private emotions and private bodily feelings. She has an open mind and her bodily and affective self is actively open and moving freely. p.7551
- this is kind of bizarre ... so certain

> Many of the interviewed dancers feel that they are "more purely themselves", or "more themselves", when immersed in dance activity--and other activities where the body leads the way. Some speak of "authenticity" and "core". p.7551

> Husserl describes reflection as being attentive, intensely and explicitly aware of the other and the world, and intensely self-aware, and that is what dancers immersed in their dance work are--on a bodily and affective level. p.7551

- even the word 'reflection' is troubling unless one were to focus on the surface of the mirror. 

> The objects reflected upon in embodied reflection are found within the realm of the activity that constitutes the state of consciousness, which means, it does not imply the dichotomy found between a conceptually reflecting subject and the object this subject reflects upon. The switch from implicit, pre-reflective embodiment to conceptual reflection creates a slight time delay that is not there in embodied reflection. The change in the way the object appears to the subject happens and stays within the embodied/affective realm. p.7552

> Embodied reflection is an active state, and its attitude is both open and receptive. Dancers don’t feel that they “forget themselves” or “lose themselves” when they get absorbed in their dance work, even if remembering or verbalizing the experience afterwards might prove challenging. Experiencing profound bodily reflection equals a profound bodily presence through the living body, and after that kind of absorption one might feel joyful, elated, and even “high”. [@buttingsrud-2021-bodies p.7552]

- I really like this language. Contrast/compare with Sondra Fraleigh (in review by Ann Daly <daly-2989-dance.pdf>):

> [The goal is] union with the larger aesthetic purpose of the dance and . .. communion with others. The magic here is that self is surpassed toward the dance and toward others. This is the aesthetically constituted, universalized (impersonalized) self (from p.29 of Dance and the Lived Body)

Daly writes:
> The dancer sacrifices the self to that higher good called the dance; without a self, there can be no self-expression. Within this aesthetics, the dancer is a sacred vessel for truth, goodness, and beauty. p.422

> As Yael explained to us, there are situations where dancers feel that they “lose” or “forget themselves” while dancing, but these are not situations characterized by heightened bodily attention. These are rather pre-reflective modes where the dance is performed automatically, on autopilot—a possibility for the skilled dancer whose choreography is second nature. Thinking about other things while dancing, the dancer’s attentive consciousness is far away from the performance at hand. Yael shared with us how this lack of correlation between the doing (the dance activ- ity) and the thinking (the conceptual reflection) had made her feel lost in the past. “When I’m connected to myself, I flow with myself—and am aware of everything”, she concludes. [@buttingsrud-2021-bodies p.7552]

- this is also fascinating. What CB is describing seems more akin to when we are lost in thought (say when driving a car and we suddenly realise we haven't paid any attention perhaps for kms and kms). This is VERY different from what KC and I are describing. 

> Throughout the article we have seen how these bodily experiences might be understood as a form of reflection, or sense making, at a bodily/affective level. I call the consciousness, which enables these experiences, embodied reflection. In this article I have presented evidence of this state’s existence through empirical, as well as theoretical sources. Through this evidence I have showed how the embodied [p.7553] reflection dancers experience through their skilful work is a state of consciousness in its own right—experiences of embodied reflection cannot be reduced to being pre-reflective or conceptually reflective experiences. [@buttingsrud-2021-bodies pp.7552-7553]

My proposition here is that there is already an ancient lens that can be used to describe these experiences -- and that is [[nonduality]]. There is no need for a new kind of consciousness that somehow marks dancers as special (something KC discusses when describing body awareness as simply another portal). But I am caught here between phenomenology, philosophy and cognitive science and their varying perspectives on the such experiences.
