# Brown - Resisting AI

> “AI presents a technological shift in the framework of society that will amplify austerity while enabling authoritarian politics,” says Dan McQuillan on the first page of this book. He goes on to make the case that AI’s main moves are to segregate and divide, to make predictions of the future based on an extension of the past—that is, to preserve, and to increase, a status quo of inequality. It’s not so much that AI is fascist, he explains, so much that it is highly suitable to fascist aims, that it is a useful tool for those who desire to bring fascism about. But there’s hope, in that we can both learn to be attuned to when and how AI is recruited into authoritarian politics, and we can counter that recruitment through commoning, mutual aid, and solidarity.
