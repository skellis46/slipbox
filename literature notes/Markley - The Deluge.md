# Stephen Markley - The Deluge

_previous note:_ 

> here are certain activities we pursue to attain a state of concentration, and those states of concentration are often more deeply enjoyable than the activities we’re indoctrinated to view as enjoyable.

> onanistic

> Violence against nature always goes hand in hand with violence against people.

> Mountains are chaos disguised as stillness, Kate had explained once. “We carve out these places in the world, spare them from our cruelties, but only because it’s one of the last ways we can still feel mystery. And then even our sense of mystery becomes another consumer edifice.”

> “Oh my god, that name is brutal,” says Morris. “I just don’t want to hear the word ‘green’ attached to anything ever a-fucking-gain. Besides, it’s a total misnomer. During extinction events, the oceans acidify, carbonate-forming species get wiped out, and it’s all replaced by green plankton. ‘Disaster plankton’ scientists call it. The oceans bloom with that shit. After the end-Triassic, the whole planet turned green. And that’s what it’ll look like again—a muddy tennis ball—unless we stop it. That’s why we monkeyed with the Phil Shabecoff phrase for our name, because green, at this point, is a dead fucking brand.”

> They knew, and they waged a propaganda war of denial and delay. They knew, and they’re still doing it! There is no other way to put it, they are committing the greatest atrocity in human history and they knew. They knew, and they told us to worry about our fucking carbon footprints.”

> I hadn’t realized that the natural cycles of the earth warming and cooling were laughably insufficient explanations, like saying your house fire began because of the arrival of spring.

> We are committed to taking capital, and therefore political power, out of the hands of a fossil-fuel oligarchy. That is the global recipe to attack a primary source of misogyny, racism, and endemic inequality. Distributed systems of energy will redistribute political and economic power faster and more decisively than any other action, period.

> J. Walter Thompson once said, “This is an age of faith. All ages have been ages of faith. Disbelief requires an effort of the will while belief requires only acquiescence.”

> She finished with a quote from Gabriel García Márquez: “If I knew that this would be the last time I would hear your voice, I’d take hold of each word to be able to hear it over and over again. If I knew this was the last time I’d see you, I’d tell you I love you, and would not just assume foolishly you know it already.”
