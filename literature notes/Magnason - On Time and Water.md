# Magnason - On Time and Water

> If you’re a writer and don’t feel the need to write about these issues, you simply don’t grasp the science or the seriousness of the matter. Anyone who understands what’s at stake would not prioritise anything else. -- Wolfgang Lucht [@magnason-2021-time p.64]

> How many people should work on the climate crisis? Millions of people would not be too many when the Earth’s future is at stake!’ -- Wolfgang Lucht[@magnason-2021-time p.65]

> Maybe scientists don’t fully understand what they are saying until other people understand.[@magnason-2021-time p.67]

## The words we do not understand

> If we could perceive in granular detail what the words ‘global warming’ contain, they should be like the threat in a fairy tale: we should feel terror. It can take decades, even centuries, to understand new words and concepts.[@magnason-2021-time p.68]

 > ‘Ocean acidification’. I feel like I understand the words, but I probably don’t. An empty gun looks like a loaded one; a gun’s usefulness, its harmfulness, depends on whether it’s loaded or not. Words have different charges to them; it takes many years for concepts to reach full charge. ‘Ocean acidification’ is as great and deep as all the oceans for all time. It is as vast as all the combined shoals of herring and sculpins, all the haddock and porpoises, the oysters, phytoplankton and sperm whales; it is as massive as all the magnificent coral reefs with their turtles, brain corals and clownfish. It is just as hard to swallow these words as it is a mouthful of sea butterflies.[@magnason-2021-time p.77]


## Searching for the Holy Cow

## A visit from a holy man

> ‘Then there are the ecological problems. I am concerned about those problems. Wherever I go, I speak on a human level. Not only on the level of Tibetans. I speak about inner values, like warm-heartedness. We are social animals and, given today’s reality, we need a sense of global responsibility. The old notion of “we” and “they”, that clear demarcation, without concerns for anyone but oneself, is outdated, it’s unrealistic. Because this world is heavily interdependent. We are all interdependent. That’s the reality.’ - Dalai Lama [@magnason-2021-time p.97]


> I say, ‘In mythology, ice is often associated with death. But now, when we look at the Himalayas, we suddenly understand that ice is the source of life. And the water flows under the glacier white as milk.’ (Magnason, p.97)
> ‘Hindus don’t even call the water of the Ganges water, but nectar. That’s how they describe water so sacred and pure it’s simply called nectar. Since I was there, I express it a little differently: whether or not you consider it nectar, in reality it’s water! Ha ha! -- Dalai Lama [@magnason-2021-time p.97]

## A revelation from the wrong God

> He pointed out that humankind has survived all kinds of local apocalypses over the past millennia; people endure and (more often than not) overcome such problems, even emerging stronger. He described humankind as ‘antifragile’: challenges, randomness, disorder do not bring us to our knees but, on the contrary, make us stronger; without challenge we wither and become weak.[@magnason-2021-time p.114]

## Back in time

> And now scientists have drawn up new horror scenarios about the consequences of a three-to-five-degree rise in Earth’s temperature. The Earth has abandoned geological speed; it is changing at human speed. And yet our response happens at a glacial pace. We hold a conference to determine the location for the next conference.[@magnason-2021-time p.126]

- tension here between geological and human speed. Zooming into a body under pressure -- asking us to slow down. Slow slow down. (coincidence as I get older? ha); see also [[Sleigh - Relationships Between the Cracks - Making Oddkin#^342953]] - time is urgent, let us slow down


## Crocodile dreams

> The sixth extinction began with the modern era, the Holocene, the Age of Humanity that commenced eleven thousand years ago with the eradication of megafauna from the continents. But all this has escalated in recent decades. Our consumer habits are volcanic in their effect, our fashion trends have more impact than tectonic shifts, our desires are earthquakes. We live in a time when the initiative of a few individuals can influence whether the strongest, most powerful predators on Earth – our era’s dragons – will live or die.[@magnason-2021-time p.133]

> Of course, humankind has affected animal species in our struggle for bread, toiling against hunger and disease. The problem is, humans don’t seem to know any boundaries. They do not know when they’re satisfied, nor when they’ve gone too far.[@magnason-2021-time p.135]

> Laozi’s _Daodejing_, or the _Classic of the Way and of Virtue_, was written in China sometime between the fourth and sixth centuries bce and published in Icelandic around 2,500 years later, in 1921, with the title _Bókin um veginn_, or _The Book of the Way_. My favourite section is about usefulness:
>> Thirty spokes coming together make up a wheel but it is the hole for the axle that makes the wheel useful.
>> We throw clay to shape pots which work because they are hollow.
>> Men cut out doors and windows and the house’s empty space inside makes it useful.
>> For existence to bear fruit what does not exist is most useful.[@magnason-2021-time p.136]

> For an area to be protected, it needs to serve as a national park or tourist destination; its purpose needs to be measurable, preferably by how the national park directly delivers dividends, employment and increased sales of goods and services in close proximity. When people discuss coral reefs, they talk about their importance for fishing and tourism. Art needs to justify itself with sales and turnover. Education and science need justifying on the basis of the products and the employment they create. What does not exist is not considered useful in itself; emptiness, the axle’s hole, is constantly impinged upon, until it now seems life’s wheels have stopped turning.[@magnason-2021-time p.137]

## A mythology for the present

> In a world where changes in many areas have been exponential, there have been more changes in the last decade than in the entire twentieth century. Around the year 2000, roughly fifty-eight million cars were produced annually in the world; now it is a hundred million a year. Half of all the plastic produced in the world came into existence after 2000.[@magnason-2021-time p.155]

## Farewell to the white giants

> Now that the glacier is changing faster than ever before, I feel within myself a paradox. My being on the glacier comes from advances and technologies, the production and mass extraction of Earth’s resources. By the time humans were able to cross glaciers, to count the nesting places of crocodiles and to study the song of the humpback whales, we’d grown so strong and expanded so far that what we were finally able to measure and understand had already started disappearing.[@magnason-2021-time p.187]

## The god in the steam engine

> Although the atomic bomb is the chosen benchmark for marking a new geological era, that geologic turning point, that new geological century, might be dated earlier: the geological era of the Anthropocene, which will be known by Earth’s warming, by glaciers melting, by rising sea levels, by acidifying oceans, by species going extinct, can be traced directly to James Watt, born in Greenock, Scotland, in the year 1736.[@magnason-2021-time p.190]

> Watt allowed us to tame fire; gradually we learned to hide the flames better, isolating the heat, smoke and soot until fire has become invisible under the glossy hoods of air-conditioned cars that go cruising around the world with their upholstered seats and pumping music.[@magnason-2021-time p.191]

> When the Eyjafjallajökull eruption began in 2010, putting a stop to European air traffic for six days, the volcano’s emissions constituted about 40 per cent of daily European air traffic emissions – about 150,000 tons per day. By halting all air traffic, it prevented 300,000 tons per day of emissions, and so became the first environmentally responsible eruption in history. Beneath all we do there’s a fire blazing; traffic advances like glowing lava.[@magnason-2021-time p.192]

> _We_ are the eruption, but we don’t see flames when we look in the mirror: everything is so well designed, so invisible. If the cars on our highways displayed their fires on the outside, the conflagration we kindle in order to get to work would be evident. We would see a distinct difference between an electric car and a gas-powered car, but the electric car also conceals flames and emissions: the fire that goes into production, the flames of the ship transporting the car between countries. If fire were to rise from the bodies of cars, we could see during the shadows of midwinter [p.193] the mighty lava flow this frenzy of traffic constitutes. We can see forest fires and burning high-rises. On the news we see tankers burst into flame or an accident causing oil reserves to catch fire, without thinking through how all this oil was meant to burn anyway, just not all in one place. We do not perceive our everyday disasters.[@magnason-2021-time pp.192-193]

> the oil becomes CO2 , an invisible, odourless gas. But, when it comes to the natural world, nothing gets used up; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The oil burns but doesn’t vanish, doesn’t diminish; quite the contrary. One ton of oil turns into 2.3 tons of CO2.[@magnason-2021-time p.193]

> The problem is not that people have risen out of poverty, but how we have toppled into overconsumption and waste. How we live in a system where most of what we create, think and make ends up being burned as fuel or becomes landfill. The Earth cannot withstand all this fire; there’s no way it can withstand all this consumption.[@magnason-2021-time p.200]

## Just more words

> If one thing characterises our time, it’s the struggle over words, the power to define the world and its economy, the power to report and shape the news. That struggle is about deciding how the world is worded. Words create reality; owning words and the means to distribute them is crucial to all powers.[@magnason-2021-time p.207]

>When two of Grandma Hulda’s siblings, Gudrún and Valur, were born weak and vulnerable, a priest was called, not a doctor. And they died. Now that the Earth is in trouble, should we call an economist or an ecologist?[@magnason-2021-time p.219]

## See the blue sea
> That coral branches break and wash ashore is part of the natural cycle. The coral reefs are constructed on the skeletons of their ancestors; corals wash ashore, where they crumble and turn into snow-white sand and thus form the reefs and white islands that protect coastlines from ocean waves. In the logs, we could clearly see how powerful the geological phenomena of corals and calcification are, but the cycle is based on the balance of death and regeneration. The increased intensity of hurricanes and the rising sea temperatures disturb the balance. Coral bleaching happens as these animals get stressed amid unfavourable environmental factors. The coral gets rid of the algae it has been living in symbiosis with, thereby losing its colour, its branches becoming ghost white. Corals can recover, but repeated neglect causes the animal to starve and die.[@magnason-2021-time p.227] ^9da54a

- get stressed. becoming ghosts like bleached coral. Time of the body. How to describe an ecology of practice -- what balances and imbalances are in play? What powerful phenomena? What increased intensities? 

## Maybe everything will be all right

> Undoubtedly, the landscape will be endearing to someone in the future, even if it changes again. People live in the world of their own moment. They get used to their environment and cannot waste emotions on grieving over everything that has changed. We have the ability to see beauty in almost every circumstance; there are people who live in deserts and find beauty and depth in the emptiness – as do people manage who live at the poles, places that have hardly seen trees or flowers.[@magnason-2021-time p.251]

> The chicken has become the world’s most abundant vertebrate. About sixty-five billion chickens are consumed annually, and at any one time the combined mass of chickens on the Earth exceeds the mass of all other birds on the planet. More than all the golden plovers, albatrosses, parrots and penguins that disappear slowly when their habitats are encroached on and their nesting sites are lost. And yet the total number of birds on the planet has not decreased; it has increased. We’ve made up the numbers with more chickens. Kentucky Fried Planet.[@magnason-2021-time p.255]

> We queue with our tents outside shops when new Nike shoes come on the market. Just as the Romantic poets heralded the golden plover. And trainers are nature, of course, part of the human ice age. Humankind is a species of animal. Our products are nature, my computer is nature, like a beehive or a Stone Age axe evolved by whetting its edges with ever more accuracy over sixty thousand years.[@magnason-2021-time p.256] ^3f3232

> It’s possible to let go and float downstream. But I’m afraid that future generations will despise that position. Someone who is twenty today could know and love another human who will still be alive in the year 2160. And, given the current shape of the world, we’re heading towards such a degree of destruction that this emerging generation will judge all our lives as laughable and foolish.[@magnason-2021-time p.259]

> And, just like art that pleases dictators, all our creations will be valued in the light of the devastation we know our way of life has caused. The beauty of coral reefs and jungles, the dignity of extinct species, these will be lined up next to all the junk we craved and used only briefly before it all ended up in landfill. Brain coral will be measured against traffic jams, the clothes we throw in the rubbish every day, the food we waste, the discarded drinks cans that go on rubbish mountains and the oil we burn for fun. If we do nothing, we will be the generation that was handed paradise and ruined it. And all because we stuck to our self-interest and our greed. All our work will be a crying shame, because nothing we produce can hold a candle to the ocean itself, nothing is as magnificent as a glacier,[p.260] nothing so mysterious as a rainforest at night. Nothing we have done will be considered remarkable if achieving it has meant closing our eyes to science and throwing away the life and happiness of future generations.[@magnason-2021-time pp.259-260] ^de1fa5

## 2050

> Many solutions improve the welfare of both humans and animals; they’ll lead to better transportation, improved living conditions and better ecology. They’ll lead to action, awareness and a sense of community. The solutions partly involve what our grandmas always told us: eat everything on our plates, hand down siblings’ clothes, darn socks, practise frugality. A large part of the solution requires sacrifice, doing something for others without asking for anything in return. Creating groups and collectives and organisations, in the spirit of the Icelandic rescue teams and glacial research societies.[@magnason-2021-time p.306]

## A future conversation

> When is someone you will love still going to be alive? p.308

> ‘Yes, can you imagine that? The person you’ll love most in all the world will still be alive in 2260! Imagine your time. I was born in 2008 and you’ll know a person who’ll still be alive in 2260. That’s the length of time you connect, more than 250 years. The time you can touch with your own hands. Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds you. And your time is also the time of the people you will know and love. The time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future every single day.’[@magnason-2021-time p.309]

## Apausalypse Now - COVID-19 Postscript

> The idea was that art is happening in every situation; art always finds a way, always, even when everything stops; art is possible and is perhaps even more important. The limitations shape the work; they are part of the art but not something that prevents it. By making a documentary in the void – the in-between space that was the lockdown – we kept sane and active, asking artists to do the same for and with us. But this was not art[p.316] just for art’s sake; it felt vital to understand what happened and our desire to explore the possibilities of this moment. What is the meaning of experiencing the big pause, the great stop, the _apausalypse_? What does it tell us about ourselves, our bodies, our nature and our systems?[@magnason-2021-time pp.315-316]
