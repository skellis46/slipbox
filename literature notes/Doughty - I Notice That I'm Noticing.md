# Sally Doughty - I Notice That I'm Noticing

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM summary:

Doughty’s chapter centres on _noticing_ as a core mechanism of improvisational practice, arguing that improvisation is not primarily about spontaneity or freedom but about cultivating a finely tuned awareness of perception, attention and choice in the moment. Drawing on her own long-term practice and on the Deborah Hay Solo Performance Commissioning Project, Doughty distinguishes between looking and noticing, and between seeing and perceiving. Noticing is framed as an active, trained attentional process that operates across sensory, cognitive and affective registers, rather than a passive state of awareness. Through journal excerpts and practice reflections, she shows how noticing functions as both a perceptual discipline and a compositional resource, enabling dancers to recognise what is salient, what is habitual and what is usually overlooked in improvisation

The chapter positions noticing as a bridge between improvisation and decision-making, resisting both romanticised notions of intuition and overly technical models of choice. Doughty argues that increased noticing expands the field of available action without prescribing outcomes, supporting improvisation as a practice of responsiveness rather than control. While she aligns noticing with concepts such as flow and present-moment awareness, she is careful to keep it grounded in embodied labour and practice-specific scores, particularly Hay’s directives such as “here and gone” and “turn your fucking head”. The chapter ultimately frames noticing as an ethical and aesthetic practice that enhances improvisational capacity by loosening attachment to fixed identities, preferences and habits, without claiming access to transcendent or exceptional states of consciousness.
