# Fred Rogers - This Beautiful Day

_previous note:_ [[feelings in conversations]]

There are many times that I wish I had heard that “just who you are at this moment, with the way that you’re feeling, is fine. You don’t have to be anything more than who you are right now.” I’d like to think it’s also something that’s happened to me through the years, that I’m more able to accept myself as I happen to be, rather than as somebody thought I should be.


“Understanding love is one of the hardest things in the world.”


Let your imagination help you to know the truth about your identity.


Our deep sense of knowing that we are cared for is probably the most important thing we human beings have for coping with the perpetual changes in our bodies, in our lives, and in the world around us.


Forgiveness is a strange thing. It can sometimes be easier to forgive our enemies than our friends.


People have said, “Don’t cry” to other people for years and years, and all it has ever meant is, “I’m too uncomfortable when you show your feelings. Don’t cry.” I’d rather have them say, “Go ahead and cry. I’m here to be with you.”


Since we were children once, the roots for our empathy are already planted within us. We’ve known what it was like to feel small and powerless, helpless and confused.


“Listening is a very active awareness of the coming together of at least two lives. Listening, as far as I’m concerned, is certainly a prerequisite of love.”


“We can’t be expected to leave the unhappy and angry parts of ourselves at the door before coming in. We all need to feel that we can bring the whole of ourselves to the people who care about us.”


“The difficult truth is that there are real limits to how much comfort we can bring to loved ones when they hurt.”


Dr. Margaret McFarland, used to say, “I love being part of the beach of life—I like being one of the grains of sand.”


I realize that it isn’t very fashionable to talk about some things as being holy; nevertheless, if we ever want to rid ourselves of personal and corporate emptiness, brokenness, loneliness, and fear, we will have to allow ourselves room for that which we cannot see, hear, touch, or control.


“It’s the things we play with and the people who help us play that make a great difference in our lives.”


If I’m sad about something, and I dismiss my sadness by saying, “Oh, well, it was for the best,” then I’m probably not willing or able to explore how I’m feeling. If I’m angry with someone, and I say, “Oh, it doesn’t matter, I don’t care,” then I probably don’t know what I’m really feeling.


Understanding invariably leads to finding caring ways to help.


His Holiness saying, “Someone else’s action should not determine your response.”


Part of the problem with the word disabilities is that it immediately suggests an inability to see or hear or walk or do other things that many of us take for granted. But what of people who can’t feel? Or talk about their feelings? Or manage their feelings in constructive ways? What of people who aren’t able to form close and strong relationships? And people who cannot find fulfillment in their lives, or those who have lost hope, who live in disappointment and bitterness and find in life no joy, no love? These, it seems to me, are the real disabilities.


“It can be hardest of all to forgive people we love. Like all of life’s important coping skills, the ability to forgive and the capacity to let go of resentments most likely take root very early in our lives.”


each one of us is so much more than any one thing.


When you combine your own intuition with a sensitivity to other people’s feelings and moods, you may be close to the origins of valuable human attributes such as generosity, altruism, compassion, sympathy, and empathy.


Whatever we choose to imagine can be as private as we want it to be. Nobody knows what you’re thinking or feeling unless you share it.


It’s my belief that the capacity to accept help is inseparable from the capacity to give help when our turn comes to be strong.


Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors.


One of the greatest paradoxes about omnipotence is that we need to feel it early in life, and lose it early in life, in order to achieve a healthy, realistic, yet exciting, sense of potency later on.


When people help us to feel good about who we are, they are really helping us to love the meaning of what we create in this life.


“Learning and loving go hand in hand.”


Development comes from within. Nature does not hurry but advances slowly.


During my speech, I asked the audience to spend one minute thinking of someone who’d made a difference in the person they’d become.


“Who we are in the present includes who we were in the past.”


The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference. I once heard a little boy say to someone, “You can’t make me mad. I don’t even like you.”


We just don’t get to be competent human beings without a lot of different investments from others.


It may be easier for us if, as children, we were allowed to have our angry feelings and if someone we loved let us know that those feelings were a normal part of loving and being loved. It will certainly have helped us if we learned to talk about those feelings and express them in healthy ways.


“Grandparents are both our past and our future. In some ways they are what has gone before, and in others they are what we will become.”


My own wish for children is that they learn to find joy even amidst the world’s and their own imperfections… that they grow to have a clear but forgiving interior voice to guide them… and that they come to have a reasonable sense of shame without an unreasonable burden of guilt.


in the perspective of infinity, our differences are infinitesimal. We are intimately related. May we never even pretend that we are not.


What a privilege to be able to look for the good in our neighbor!


we can’t really understand a person unless we have the chance of knowing who that person has been, and what that person has done and liked and suffered and believed.


How our words are understood doesn’t depend just on how we express our ideas. It also depends on how someone receives what we’re saying.


That kind of solitude goes by many names. It may be called “meditation” or “deep relaxation,” “quiet time” or “downtime.” In some circles, it may even be criticized as “daydreaming.” Whatever it’s called, it’s a time away from outside stimulation, during which inner turbulence can settle, and we have a chance to become more familiar with ourselves.


We speak with more than our mouths. 
We listen with more than our ears.


“So in loving and appreciating our neighbor, we’re participating in something sacred.”


I started to look behind the things that people did and said; and little by little, concluded that Saint-Exupéry was absolutely right when he wrote in The Little Prince: “What is essential is invisible to the eyes.” So after a lot of sadness, I began a lifelong search for what is essential, what it is about my neighbor that doesn’t meet the eye.


Whether we’re a preschooler or a young teen, a graduating college senior or a retired person, we human beings all want to know that we’re acceptable, that our being alive somehow makes a difference in the lives of others.


The urge to make and build seems to be an almost universal human characteristic. It goes way beyond meeting our need for survival and seems to be the expression of some deep-rooted part of being human.


And we spend our lives trying to recognize that we truly are lovable and capable of loving.


We all have our limits of patience and endurance, no matter what age we are, and that’s something children need to know is natural, human, and acceptable.


Because if you’re trusted, then people will allow you to share their inner garden—what greater gift!


Deep within us—no matter who we are—there lives a feeling of wanting to be lovable, of wanting to be the kind of person that others like to be with. And the greatest thing we can do is to let people know that they are loved and capable of loving.


I am glad that I’ve been able to do what I’ve done and not been sidetracked along the way. A teacher of mine calls it guided drift. Isn’t that wonderful? You’re drifting, and yet you’ve got a rudder.


We all need to learn that life is a mixture of what is and is not possible.


Every human being needs to be loved and needs to be able to love in return. That is what allows us to be human.


My hope for all of us is that “the miles we go before we sleep” will be filled with all the feelings that come from deep caring—delight, sadness, joy, wisdom—and that in all the endings of our life, we will be able to see the new beginnings.


The great poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote: “Be patient towards all that is unsolved in your heart, and learn to love the questions themselves.”


The woman beside me had come in need. Somehow the words of that poorly crafted sermon had been translated into a message that spoke to her heart. On the other hand, I had come in judgment, and I heard nothing but the faults.


We don’t have to think it’s funny when we feel like we need some extra comfort. I sometimes sing about that to children, but, as you know, I believe there’s a child somewhere in each of us. We all have times like that—times when an extra measure of care is needed. We need comfort and so does everyone else. And it’s nothing to be ashamed of.


at the root of all art and all science there exists a gap—a gap between what the world is like and what we wish and hope for it to be like. Our unique way of bridging that gap in each of our lives seems to me to be the essence of the reason for human creativity.


I’m proud of you for standing up for something you believed in—something that wasn’t particularly popular, but that assured the rights of someone less fortunate than you.


May you seek out your own continuing life education and, over time, over your whole lifetime, may you grow in faith and reverence, uprightness in morals, knowledge of language and arts, forgiveness, honesty, commitment, maturity, and your capacity to love.


My hope for you at the beginning of this new moment in your life is that you will take good care of that part of you where your best dreams come from, that invisible part of you that allows you to look on yourself and your neighbor with delight.


So in all that you do in all of your life, I wish you the strength and the grace to make those choices which will allow you and your neighbor to become the best of whoever you are.
