# Kishimi & Koga - The Courage to be Disliked

_previous note:_ [[Katie - Loving What Is]]

## THE FIRST NIGHT: Deny Trauma

### Trauma Does Not Exist

> We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences -- the so-called trauma -- but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining. 

- aetiology (eziologia) vs teleology (teologia)

### Don’t Fall for the “Life-Lie”
> Adler called the state of coming up with all manner of pretexts in order to avoid the life tasks the “life-lie.”

### From the Psychology of Possession to the Psychology of Practice
> We humans are not so fragile as to simply be at the mercy of etiological (cause-and-effect) traumas. From the standpoint of teleology, we choose our lives and our lifestyles ourselves. We have the power to do that.

## THE THIRD NIGHT: Discard Other People’s Tasks

### What Real Freedom Is

> freedom is being disliked by other people.

> The courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. When you have gained that courage, your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into things of lightness.

## THE FOURTH NIGHT: Where the Center of the World Is

### Why Am I Only Interested in Myself?

> The fact that there are people who do not think well of you is proof that you are living in freedom. You might have a sense of something about this that seems self-centered. But I think you have understood this from today’s discussion: A way of living in which one is constantly troubled by how one is seen by others is a self-centered lifestyle in which one’s sole concern is with the “I.”

### Listen to the Voice of a Larger Community

> Therefore, there is a principle of action that I would like you to commit to memory. When we run into difficulties in our interpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way out, what we should consider first and foremost is the principle that says, “Listen to the voice of the larger community.”

> Living in fear of one’s relationships falling apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other people.

### Do Not Rebuke or Praise

> Whether we praise or rebuke others, the only difference is one of the carrot or the stick, and the background goal is manipulation. The reason Adlerian psychology is highly critical of reward-and-punishment education is that its intention is to manipulate children.

> equal but not the same

### The Encouragement Approach

> That’s right, one neither praises nor rebukes. This kind of assistance, which is based on horizontal relationships, is referred to in Adlerian psychology as “encouragement.”

### How to Feel You Have Value

> The most important thing is to not judge other people. “Judgment” is a word that comes out of vertical relationships. If one is building horizontal relationships, there will be words of more straightforward gratitude and respect and joy.

> In Adler’s view, “It is only when a person is able to feel that he has worth that he can possess courage.”
 
> Instead of feeling judged by another person as “good,” being able to feel, by way of one’s own subjective viewpoint, that “I can make contributions to other people.” It is at that point that, at last, we can have a true sense of our own worth. Everything we have been discussing about community feeling and encouragement connects here.

### Exist in the Present

> YOUTH: That’s just utterly hypocritical! It’s nothing more than the nonsensical talk of a hypocrite. It sounds like the “neighborly love” that Christians talk about. The community feeling, the horizontal relationships, the gratitude for existence, and so on. Who on earth could actually do such things?
> PHILOSOPHER: With regard to this issue of community feeling, there was a person who asked Adler a similar question. Adler’s reply was the following: “Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.” My advice is exactly the same.

## THE FIFTH NIGHT: To Live in Earnest in the Here and Now

### Excessive Self-Consciousness Stifles the Self

> There is no need to rush the answers. What we need is dialogue.

### Not Self-Affirmation— Self-Acceptance

> It’s about community feeling, after all. Concretely speaking, it’s making the switch from attachment to self (self-interest) to concern for others (social interest) and gaining a sense of community feeling. Three things are needed at this point: “self-acceptance,” “confidence in others,” and “contribution to others.”

### The Difference Between Trust and Confidence

> YOUTH: An antonym of confidence? Uh . . .
> PHILOSOPHER: It is doubt. Suppose you have placed “doubt” at the foundation of your interpersonal relations. That you live your life doubting other people—doubting your friends and even your family and those you love. What sort of relationship could possibly arise from that? The other person will detect the doubt in your eyes in an instant. He or she will have an instinctive understanding that “this person does not have confidence in me.” Do you think one would be able to build some kind of positive relationship from that point? It is precisely because we lay a foundation of unconditional confidence that it is possible for us to build a deep relationship.

> When one is sad, one should be sad to one’s heart’s content. It is precisely when one tries to escape the pain and sadness that one gets stuck and ceases to be able to build deep relationships with anyone. Think about it this way. We can believe. And we can doubt. But we are aspiring to see others as our comrades. To believe or to doubt—the choice should be clear.

### The Essence of Work Is a Contribution to the Common Good

> YOUTH: In other words, you’re saying that to feel “it’s okay to be here,” one has to see others as comrades. And that to see others as comrades, one needs both self-acceptance and confidence in others.
> PHILOSOPHER: That’s right. You are grasping this more quickly now. To take it a step farther, one may say that people who think of others as enemies have not attained self-acceptance and do not have enough confidence in others.



> We are truly aware of our own worth only when we feel that our existence and behavior are beneficial to the community, that is to say, when one feels “I am of use to someone.” Do you remember this? In other words, contribution to others, rather than being about getting rid of the “I” and being of service to someone, is actually something one does in order to be truly aware of the worth of the “I.”

### You Can Be Happy Now

> PHILOSOPHER: For a human being, the greatest unhappiness is not being able to like oneself. Adler came up with an extremely simple answer to address this reality. Namely, that the feeling of “I am beneficial to the community” or “I am of use to someone” is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has worth.
> YOUTH: Do you mean the “contribution to others” you mentioned earlier?
> PHILOSOPHER: Yes. And this is an important point: When we speak of contribution to others, it doesn’t matter if the contribution is not a visible one.
> YOUTH: It doesn’t matter if the contribution is not a visible one?
> PHILOSOPHER: You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use. That is the task of other people, and is not an issue in which you can intervene. In principle, there is not even any way you can know whether you have really made a contribution. That is to say, when we are engaging in this contribution to others, the contribution does not have to be a visible one—all we need is the subjective sense that “I am of use to someone,” or in other words, a feeling of contribution.
> YOUTH: Wait a minute! If that’s the case, then what you are calling happiness is . . .
> PHILOSOPHER: Do you see it now? In a word, happiness is the feeling of contribution. That is the definition of happiness.
