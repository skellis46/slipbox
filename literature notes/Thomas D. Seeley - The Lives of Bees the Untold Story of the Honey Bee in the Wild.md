## Highlights

> After an hour or so, the bees will be familiar with the flight route between your feeder and their home, and many will fly a direct course—a beeline—back to their nest. (Location 489)


> Clearly, the mother queen does well to flee the killing field of her old nest before her murderous daughter queens emerge from their cells. (Location 2319)


> On a typical day, a colony will field several thousand worker bees, or about one-third of its members, as foragers. Thus, in acquiring its food, a honey bee colony functions as a large, diffuse, amoeboid entity that can extend itself over great distances and in multiple directions simultaneously to exploit a vast array of food sources. (Location 2616)


> Coding of distance information in waggle dance: the duration of each waggle run is proportional to the length of the outbound flight. (Location 2801)


> We then swapped the positions of the richer and poorer feeders for the afternoon, and by four o’clock the colony had switched the primary focus of its foraging from south to north. (Location 2900)


> From late autumn to midwinter, the time when honey bee colonies are without brood, the temperature of the bees clustered inside a hollow tree or man-made hive stays well above freezing. The core temperature of a broodless winter cluster rarely falls below 18°C (64°F), and the temperature of its mantle—its outermost layer—usually stays above 7°C (44°F), even when the ambient temperature is −20°C (−4°F) or colder. Then from late winter to early autumn, the stretch of time when colonies are rearing brood, the temperature in the nursery region of a honey bee colony’s nest is maintained between 34.5°C and 35.5°C (94°–96°F), varying by less than 0.5°C (1°F) across a day, even if the temperature outside drops below 0°C (32°F) in late winter or it soars above 40°C (104°F) on the hottest days of summer. (Location 2993)


> On average, a bee raised at 32°C performed only 10 circuits of the waggle dance upon return to the hive, whereas those raised at 34.5° or 36°C performed 50 circuits. Also, the waggle dances performed by the 32°C-reared bees indicated the feeder’s 300-meter distance with less precision than those of their sisters reared at the two higher temperatures. (Location 3004)


> The temperature of any living system reflects the relative rates at which it gains heat and it loses heat, so to understand how a honey bee colony maintains a stable, and elevated, temperature in its brood nest, we must examine how it adjusts both its production of heat through metabolism and its loss of heat through various means, including nest ventilation and evaporative cooling. (Location 3009)


> A worker bee in flight expends energy at a rate of about 500 watts/kilogram (230 watts/pound). In comparison, the maximum power output of an Olympic rower is only about 20 watts/kilogram (9 watts/pound). Therefore, whenever a bee is airborne, she not only consumes the energy in her fuel at a prodigious rate, she also generates a great deal of heat. The efficiency of a bee’s flight apparatus in converting metabolic fuel to mechanical power is about 10–20 percent, so more than 80 percent of the energy expended in flight appears as heat in the muscles. The rate of heat loss from a worker bee’s hairy thorax is sufficiently low that during sustained flight her thorax temperature is typically 10°–15°C (18°–27°F) above the ambient temperature. (Location 3032)


> The frequency of this mistake depends on how the hives are arranged in the apiary, and it can be greatly reduced by increasing their spacing, painting them different colors, and having them face different directions. (Location 3610)
