> How a flour is milled can have an effect on flow too. The milling process and the hardness of the grain determines the amount of **damaged starch** that is produced during milling. (Despite the name, "damaged" isn't necessarily a bad thing here: some amount of damaged starch is inevitable, and it plays essential roles in baking: Starch damage makes the sugars in the starches accessible for fermentation; without some amount of damaged starch, a dough will ferment sluggishly, if at all.) Damaged starch absorbs two to three times as much water as undamaged starch, so the more damaged starch, the more water the flour will absorb.

> Much of the effort in bread baking is directed toward achieving the proper balance between extensibility and elasticity in a dough, in order to achieve a dough that flows *just so*—one not so elastic that it is hard to shape—bakers call these doughs “bucky”—while not so extensible that it runs off the bench or collapses after shaping (or “slack”). This delicate dance happens throughout the bread baking process: in the initial choice of flours and hydration, the inclusion of a preferment or not (and the selection of preferment type), mixing method and degree, folding, degree of fermentation, shaping technique, and more.

> Glutenin gives doughs elasticity and strength, while gliadin provides extensibility and flow. In wheat flour, the ratio of glutenin and gliadin is relatively balanced. Spelt flour is much higher in gliadin than wheat flour, so adding spelt to a formula can yield a more extensible dough. (And using too much of it can produce doughs that are slack, making them challenging to shape and low in volume once baked, unless a baker makes other adjustments to the process or formula.)

> Ditto for doughs—manipulation during folding and shaping creates tension. Dough tension can be ephemeral or permanent; the tension created by folds done early on in the bulk fermentation or spaced far apart fades, while those done closer together or later on will produce lasting tension.

> During preshaping and final shaping, a loaf has both external and internal tension. The “skin” of the loaf is like a bag around the dough; by manipulating the tension in the skin, a baker can often coax even a loose, less-than-structured mass of dough into a smooth, stable shape. **Stitching**—cross-linking the skin of the loaf across its seam—is one form of dough tensioning during shaping, as is **rounding** or **cloaking**, in which the baker uses the friction of the loaf against the bench to tighten the skin. The internal tension of a loaf is created by the strength and structure within the dough.

> (A dough’s alveoli are formed during mixing, *not* fermentation; they begin as micro-bubbles invisible to the eye when air is first incorporated into the dough.)

> Once the dough has expanded maximally, folds become challenging to perform, at least without severely degassing the dough. The taut, swollen dough resists stretching out, and is likely to tear if handled excessively. And any folds that *can* be done tend to unravel. For this reason, most bakers tend to cluster their folds during the early-to-middle phases of the bulk fermentation, so that the internal structure of the dough is set before the dough has fully expanded. After the folds are complete, the dough is then allowed to rest, to complete fermenting and relax somewhat before shaping.

> Since fermentation rate and gas accumulation increases over time, acidity does too. When dissolved in the water in the dough, carbon dioxide is acidic, so the pH of a dough drops (i.e., becomes more acidic) as fermentation progresses. When a dough is fermented with sourdough or is yeasted and long-fermented, lactic acid bacteria also contribute organic acids to the dough, lowering the pH further. Acids strengthen the bonds between gluten strands, so fermentation strengthens dough structure *doubly:* both from the force of the expanding alveoli on the dough and the accumulation of acids.

> Doughs containing large quantities of whole-grain or high-extraction flour—with high percentages of enzyme-rich bran—have naturally higher enzyme loads. They also ferment more quickly, thanks to the extra enzymes and nutrition they supply, so a baker must take extra care when formulating these doughs and anticipate how they will behave as the fermentation progresses.

> The addition of preferments—sourdough or yeasted—can increase or decrease dough strength depending upon a number of factors. Preferments bring structure to a dough because the gluten they contain is pre-developed; they also supply acidity, which further strengthens the final dough. Thus, the *amount* of preferment used in a dough has great implications for how the final dough behaves. When the preferment is sourdough, the amount used also dictates the rate at which the final dough ferments.
