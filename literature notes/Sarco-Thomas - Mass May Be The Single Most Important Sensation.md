# Malaika Sarco Thomas - Mass May Be The Single Most Important Sensation

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

LLM summary:

Sarco-Thomas’s chapter argues that mass is a foundational but under-theorised sensation in dance improvisation, one that precedes and organises more commonly discussed sensations such as touch, weight, effort or kinaesthetic awareness. Drawing on somatic practices, phenomenology and improvisational experience, the author treats mass not simply as a physical property but as a lived, relational sensation through which dancers perceive themselves as material bodies in continual negotiation with gravity, momentum and resistance. Mass is presented as what gives movement consequence: it is the felt density, inertia and gravitational pull that makes action matter, grounds attention and anchors improvisation in the real conditions of embodiment rather than abstract intention or expressive choice

The chapter develops this claim by showing how attention to mass shifts improvisational practice away from image-driven, representational or expressive logics and toward an ethics of responsiveness. Sensing mass foregrounds yielding, falling, suspending and being carried rather than initiating or controlling movement, complicating notions of agency and authorship in improvisation. Sarco-Thomas suggests that mass operates as a stabilising yet destabilising force: it stabilises perception by rooting awareness in corporeal reality, while simultaneously destabilising habitual movement patterns and ego-driven decision-making. In this sense, mass functions as a generative constraint that opens improvisation to non-virtuosic, non-spectacular modes of dancing, where movement emerges from the body’s ongoing negotiation with physical forces rather than from choreographic intention or stylistic preference.
