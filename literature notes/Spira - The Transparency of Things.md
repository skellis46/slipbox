# Rupert Spira - The Transparency of Things – Contemplating the Nature of Experience

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

> From an early age we are encouraged to formulate our experience in ways that seem to express and validate it, and these expressions subsequently condition the way the world appears. ‘David loves Jane,’ ‘Tim saw the bus.’ Our earliest formulations divide experience into ‘I’ and ‘other,’ ‘me’ and ‘the world,’ a subject experiencing an object. From that time on, our experience seems to validate these formulations. However, at a certain stage it begins to dawn on us that these formulations do not express our experience, but rather they condition it.

> The essential discovery of all the great spiritual traditions is the identity of Consciousness and Reality, the discovery that the fundamental nature of each one of us is identical with the fundamental nature of the universe. This has been expressed in many different ways. ‘Atman equals Brahman.’ ‘I and my Father are one.’ ‘Nirvana equals Samsara.’ ‘Emptiness is Form.’ ‘I am That.’ ‘Consciousness is All.’ ‘There are not two things.’ ‘Sat Chit Ananda.’

> The meaning of the words is not in the words themselves. Their meaning is in the contemplation from which they arise and to which they point. The text, therefore, is laid out with lots of space in order to encourage a contemplative approach.

> The new formulations are perhaps closer or more accurate expressions of our experience than the old ones, but their purpose is not to replace the old certainties with new ones. They simply lead to an open Unknowingness, which can be formulated from moment to moment in response to a given situation, including a question about the nature of experience. There are many ways to come to this open Unknowingness, and the dismantling of our false certainties through investigation is just one of them that is offered here.

> And yet at the moment when the paper is indicated, we seem to experience something new. We have the strangely familiar experience of becoming aware of something which we were in fact already aware of. We become aware of being aware of the paper.

> The paper is not a new experience that is created by this indication. However, our awareness of the paper seems to be a new experience.

> Now what about the awareness itself, which is aware of the paper? Is it not always present behind and within every experience, just as the paper is present behind and within the words on this page? And when our attention is drawn to it, do we not have the same strange feeling of having been made aware of something that we were in fact always aware of, but had not noticed?

> Is this awareness not the most intimate and obvious fact of our experience, essential to and yet independent of the particular qualities of each experience itself,

> Is this awareness itself not the support and the substance of every experience in the same way that the paper is the support and the substance of every word?

> Does anything new need to be added to this page in order to see the paper? Does anything new need to be added to this current experience in order to become aware of the awareness that is its support and substance?

> Likewise, having noticed the awareness behind and within each experience, do we lose sight of that awareness when we return the focus of our attention to the objective aspect of experience? Do we not now see the two, the apparent two, Awareness and its object, simultaneously as one? And has it not always been so?

> Does the content of each experience affect the awareness in which it appears?

> Every experience only expresses Awareness or Consciousness, although experience itself is infinitely varied.

> Awareness or Consciousness is the open Unknowingness on which every experience is written. It is so obvious that it is not noticed. It is so close that it cannot be known as an object and yet is always known. It is so intimate that every experience, however tiny or vast, is utterly saturated and permeated with its presence.

> Duality, the subject/object polarization, is inherent in the concepts of the mind. For instance, when we speak of the ‘body’ we refer to an object, which in turn implies a subject. If we explore this object we discover that it is non-existent as such and is in fact only a ‘sensation.’

> However, a ‘sensation’ is still an object and further exploration reveals that it is in fact made of ‘sensing,’ of ‘mind stuff,’ rather than anything physical. However, ‘sensing’ in turn is discovered to be made of ‘knowing.’ And if we explore ‘knowing’ we find that it is made of Consciousness. If we explore Consciousness we find that it has no objective qualities. And yet it is what we most intimately know ourselves to be. It is what we refer to as ‘I.’ And if we explore ‘I’ we find it is made of... The abstract concepts of the mind collapse here. They cannot go any further. There is no adequate name for that into which the mind dissolves. We are taken to the utmost simplicity of direct experience.

> Mind describes the names and forms through which That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named refracts itself, in order to make itself appear as two, as many, in order to make Consciousness/Being appear as Consciousness and Being.

> However, by speaking in this way, mind is being used to create evocations rather than descriptions of the experience of Consciousness knowing itself.

> These evocations are temporary expressions of That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named, like flowers blossoming for a moment, shedding the perfume of their origin on the Garden of Unknowing.

> This clear seeing is not an intellectual understanding, although it may be formulated provisionally in intellectual terms when required by the current situation. Rather, it is the direct, intimate and immediate knowing of ourselves resting in and as the formless expanse of Presence, and simultaneously dancing in the vibrancy and aliveness of every gesture and nuance of the body, mind and world.

> We start with experience and stay close to it. We do not start with a theory, a model, a map or a teaching, and then try to fit our experience into that model. Absolutely nothing is taken for granted.

> It is the same with our experience. The contemplations in this book are like MRI scans of our experience. They look at experience from many angles, spreading it out, opening it up. However, our experience itself is always one.

> It is sometimes thought that this kind of enquiry is intellectual and abstract and seems to bear little relation to our day-to-day experience. However, it is only because our conventional dualistic concepts about the nature of Reality are themselves so densely interwoven with abstract and erroneous ideas that they require some meticulous deconstruction.

> However, it is precisely the idea that the body and the world exist as objects in time and space, independent and separate from Consciousness, that is intellectual and abstract. It is not based on experience. And by the same token, the idea that there is only the experience of Consciousness knowing itself in and as objects, becomes a self-evident, obvious and indisputable fact of experience.

> The body and the world continue to appear in the same way, but it is clearly seen that the experience of the appearance of the body and the world takes place simultaneously with the experience of Consciousness knowing itself. It is the same experience, one experience.

> What do we know about Consciousness? We know that Consciousness is, and that everything is known by and through it. However, Consciousness itself cannot be known as an object.


> Therefore the investigation into the nature of ourselves and of the world of objects initially has more to do with the exposure of deeply held ideas and beliefs about the way we think things are, than of acquiring any new knowledge. It is the exposure of our false certainties.

> We believe that we are the subject of our experience and that everything and everyone else is the object. We believe that we, as this subject, are the doer of our actions, the thinker of our thoughts, the feeler of our feelings, the chooser of our choices. We believe that this entity we consider ourselves to be, has freedom of choice over some aspects of experience but not others.

> We believe that objects exist independently of their being perceived, that Consciousness is personal and limited, that it is a by-product of the mind and that mind is a by-product of the body.

> The only field available for enquiry is experience itself. This may seem almost too obvious to mention, but its implications are profound. It implies that we never experience anything outside experience. If there is something outside experience, we have absolutely no knowledge of it, and therefore cannot legitimately assert that it exists.

> All experience takes place here and now, so the nature of Reality, whatever that is, must be present in the intimacy and immediacy of this current experience.

> Consciousness is in fact always knowing itself. However, through this deconstruction of concepts, Consciousness comes to recognise itself, not through the reflected veil of apparent objects, but knowingly and directly. Concepts are not destroyed in this process. They are still available for use when needed.

> Although this is never our actual experience, the mind is so persuasive and convincing that we have duped ourselves into believing that we actually experience these two elements, that we experience the world separate and apart from our Self, and that we experience our own Self as a separate and independent Consciousness.

> We are giving the mind credibility in spite of its limitations. We are acknowledging its ability to play a part in drawing attention to that which is beyond itself or outside the sphere of its knowledge.

> They are dissolved by our openness to the possibility that in this moment we actually experience only one thing, that experience is not divided into ‘I’ and other, subject and object, me and the world, Consciousness and Existence. We are open to the possibility that there is only one single, seamless totality, that Consciousness and Existence are one, that there is only one Reality.

> The edifice of dualistic ideas, which seems to be validated by experience, is well constructed with beliefs at the level of the mind and feelings at the level of the body, which are tightly interwoven, mutually substantiating and validating one another.

> Our experience itself does not change but we feel that it changes. Reality remains as it always is, for it is what it is, independent of the ideas we entertain about it.

> However, our interpretation changes and this new interpretation becomes the cornerstone of a new possibility. This new possibility comes from an unknown direction. It does not come as an object, a thought or a feeling. It is unveiled, in most cases, as a series of revelations, each dismantling part of the previous edifice of dualistic thinking.

> Consciousness veils itself from itself by pretending to limit itself to a separate entity and then forgets that it is pretending.

> However, it may be revealed by it. Understanding is often preceded by a line of enquiry and can subsequently be formulated by the mind. Such a formulation, which comes from understanding and not from concepts, has the power to take us to the experience of Reality. Through its reasoning powers the mind is brought to its own limit and, as a result, the edifice of mind collapses. This is the experience of understanding, the timeless moment in which Consciousness is revealed to itself. Consciousness perceives itself. It knows itself, knowingly.

> I, this Consciousness that is seeing these words and experiencing whatever it is that is being experienced in this moment, is not located inside a mind. The mind is not located inside a body and the body is not located inside a world. The body is simply the sensation of the body and the world is simply the perception of the world.

> Take away sensing and perceiving from the experience of the body and the world, and what objective qualities are left of them? None! Sensations and perceptions are made out of mind – that is, they are made out of sensing and perceiving. There is no other substance to them other than sensing and perceiving.

> However, we have said that this space is, like Consciousness, endowed with the capacity to experience, that it is an ‘experiencing space.’ So to look for itself is unnecessary because it is, by definition, already perceiving itself. It is already experiencing itself, because that is what it is. Its nature is ‘experiencing.’

> Its being itself is the knowing or experiencing of itself.

> Consciousness is transparent, colourless, Self-luminous, Self-experiencing, Self-knowing, Self-evident. That is our experience in this moment. Consciousness is known as Omnipresence, because there is nowhere where Consciousness is not. It is not that Consciousness is everywhere. It is that every ‘where’ is in Consciousness. Consciousness is known as Omniscience, because whatever is known is known by and through Consciousness. It knows all that is known.

> It is known as Omnipotence, because whatever appears depends solely on Consciousness for its Existence. Whatever appears emerges out of, is sustained by and is dissolved into, Consciousness. Consciousness creates everything out of it own Being.

> When we say that the mind can explore its limits we are really saying that Consciousness, the Knowingness that is Consciousness, takes the shape of abstract thinking and, through this shape, explores its own capacity to represent itself in the abstract terms of thought.


> Meditation is simply to abide as oneself. We remain as we are and allow the mind, the body and the world to appear and disappear without interference. If there is interference, then that is understood to be part of the mind’s activity and is allowed to be exactly as it is.


> Consciousness is what we are, and to be as we are is the highest form of meditation. All other meditations are simply a modulation of this meditation of abidance as we are.

> Normally we are only aware of the known, but when attention is drawn to the presence of the Knower, to that which knows and experiences, whatever that is, it immediately becomes obvious that there is something present that is conscious of the body, the mind and the world.

> The Knower is Consciousness. It is that which knows and experiences. It is this Consciousness that we refer to when we say, ‘I.’

> When it is said, “We give our attention to that which is known,” it means that it is ‘I,’ Consciousness, that gives its attention to that which is known.

> So when it is said, “We give our attention to the Knower, to Consciousness,” it means in practice that ‘I,’ Consciousness, withdraws its attention from its exclusive focus on the known, on objects.

> The mind is a series of abstract concepts that appear within Consciousness. Every thought is an object and therefore the objectless Consciousness in which thoughts appear can never itself appear as a thought.

> When we think of anything other than Consciousness (or Truth or Reality or whatever word is used) we end up with a concept, an idea of that thing, which is not the thing itself. It is a representation of that thing in the mind’s code – that is, it is a concept.

> However, the thought about Consciousness or Reality is unique amongst all thoughts. When we try to think of Consciousness, it is like looking into a black hole. It is not even black. The mind simply cannot go there. It cannot go to that objectless place because the mind is itself an object. How could an object fit into a space that has no dimensions?

> So as the mind tries to turn itself towards Consciousness, it dissolves. It is consumed in what is, from its own point of view, the nothingness of Consciousness. However, its dissolution is the revelation of Presence, the revelation of that in which thought dissolves.

> Nothing objective is known in this placeless place of Consciousness. It is a knowing but not a knowing of something. It is pure Knowingness.

> A time comes when the thought gives up its last layer of objectivity and merges into Presence. In fact it is Presence that gradually gives up identification with subtler and subtler layers of objectivity, until it comes to recognize thought as its very own self. The mind does not find Truth. It does not find Reality. It is dissolved in it.

> Understanding is the dissolution of the mind into its support, into its ground. It is the experience of Consciousness knowing itself, returning to itself knowingly.

> Once we have fully understood that meditation is not an activity, the activity that we previously considered to be meditation will naturally come to an end. At that point, the understanding that meditation is not an activity has fulfilled its purpose and can also be abandoned.

> This open, free, unlimited Consciousness has contracted upon itself. It has seemingly shrunk itself into the narrow frame of a body and a mind, and limited itself to a tiny location in a vast space and into a brief moment in an endless expanse of time.

> At the level of the body these contractions are made out of bodily sensations with which Consciousness identifies itself. They are the apparent location of ‘I’ inside the body.

> In spite of this there are frequent intrusions into its own self-generated isolation which remind itself of its real nature... the smile of a stranger, the cry of an infant, an unbearable grief, a brief desireless moment upon the fulfilment of a desire, a moment of humour, the peace of deep sleep, a pause in the thinking process, a memory of childhood, the transition between dreaming and waking, the recognition of beauty, the love of a friend, a glimpse of understanding.

> Consciousness projects this current experience out of itself. It then loses itself in this projection, in the mind/body/world that it has projected from within itself, and identifies itself with a part of it. It is as if it says to itself, “I am no longer this open, free, unlimited Consciousness. Rather I am this limited fragment that I have just created within myself. I am a body.” In doing so Consciousness forgets itself. It forgets its own unlimited nature. This forgetting is known as ‘ignorance.’ It is Consciousness ignoring itself.

> The impulses to search, to seek, to avoid, to pretend, to contract, keep appearing but Consciousness is no longer compelled by them. It recognises the impulses but no longer acts on them. And, as a result, the frequency and ferocity of these impulses begin to subside.

> Consciousness no longer goes out of itself towards things. It stays at home within itself and things come to it. Things – that is, thoughts, feelings and perceptions – come to it, appear to it, arise within it, but Consciousness no longer needs to forget itself in order to experience the body, the mind and the world.

> Consciousness realises that the separate entity that it previously took itself to be, is in fact simply an activity that it does, from time to time. And by the same token, it realises that the activity that it seemed to do from time to time, the activity that we call meditation, is in fact what it always is.

> It realises that meditation is not a state that comes and goes, but that it is that in which all states come and go.

> From the point of view of ignorance, the ‘person’ is what we are and ‘meditation’ is something that we do from time to time. From the point of view of understanding, ‘meditation’ is what we are and the ‘person’ is something that we do from time to time.

> Ego is not an entity. It is an activity. It is an optional activity of identifying itself with a fragment that Consciousness is free to make or not, from moment to moment. It is the activity of thinking and feeling that ‘I,’ this Consciousness that is seeing and understanding these words, am only this body/ mind and not anything else that ‘I’ perceive.

> This thought and feeling arises within Consciousness and is an expression of Consciousness. It is the activity of Consciousness pretending to be a body and a mind, and then forgetting that it is pretending and, instead, actually thinking and feeling that it is a body and a mind.

> Consciousness has to go further and rediscover its absolute identity with all things. It has to discover that ‘I am everything,’ that this Consciousness here is identical with that Reality out there. In other words it has to discover that it is impersonal and unlimited.

> We have no evidence of a world that exists outside our experience of it. Nor is it ever possible to have such an experience, because experience itself is the touchstone of evidence.

> Imagine that you have spent your whole life living in a large house serving a demanding old man who lives in a room on the top floor.

> Our subservience to a separate entity consists, at the level of the mind, in the belief that ‘I’ am a separate, personal entity, and at the level of the body, as a feeling that ‘I’ am this body, or ‘I’ am in this body.

> As a pedagogical tool, the Advaita or non-dual teaching sometimes refers to Consciousness and its contents, the appearances that arise within it, as two separate elements. This establishes the independence of Consciousness from appearances and the dependence of appearances on Consciousness.

> The shape of the wave is the form that the water takes. It is the form of the appearance. ‘Wave’ is its name. But the content of that appearance is not wave. It is water. Similarly, in order to ‘appear,’ Consciousness ‘clothes’ itself in name and form. It takes the shape of an appearance by projecting itself through mind and senses. However, the content of every experience is Consciousness itself.

> So objects – that is, thoughts, sensations and perceptions – are not the content of Consciousness. Consciousness alone is the content of Consciousness. Thoughts, sensations and perceptions are the names and forms that Consciousness takes in the process of manifestation.

> One who is fearful of leaving his home projects all sorts of unpleasant things onto the outside world in order to justify his desire to remain indoors. Everything he sees and hears of the outside world seems to justify his attitude towards it and it will be very difficult to persuade such a person that it is in fact his attitude of fear that causes the world to appear in a certain way, rather than being the result of the way the world inherently is. In the same way Consciousness becomes accustomed to thinking and feeling that it lives inside the body/mind and it substantiates this habit with layer upon layer of belief and feeling. Once it has taken this position, its experience seems to substantiate the truth of its beliefs and feelings.

> Suffering is already a rejection of the current situation, a lack of acceptance of the current situation as it is. This rejection is the counterpart of Consciousness’ exclusive identification with a body/mind. That is what suffering boils down to.

> This so-called acceptance of the rejection of the moment is not the true, impartial, benevolent welcoming of everything within Consciousness. It is fear dressed up as understanding, pseudo Advaita. As such it is the very activity of ego itself, perpetuating its own isolation and misery.

> In the same way, every experience is only the presence of Consciousness shining. We do not have to go anywhere else, or do anything else to know or experience this. It is all we ever experience.

> From the point of view of mind, objects veil Consciousness. From the point of view of Reality, objects reveal Consciousness.

**Note:** Love Love this point of view re different perspectives

> The screen is in fact never obscured by the appearance of the game. It is all we ever see. We just sometimes fail to notice it. The players seem to obscure the screen but in fact they do not. Rather they reveal it. However, in doing so, they do not reveal something that is hidden. They reveal something, the screen, that is always in plain view, that is always being perceived, but is sometimes not noticed.

**Note:** Losing oneself - can i construct similar framing re movement? This is what movement does. It's The football game.

> Having said that, turning off the television is necessary, in most cases, to draw attention to the presence of the screen, to show that the screen was there first, to show that the players depend on the screen but that the screen does not depend on the players.

> It is only Presence that is dancing in this and every moment.

> From the point of view of ignorance, Consciousness seems to take on the qualities of the body/mind. That is, it seems to become personal and limited.

> From the point of view of understanding, our true body and our true mind is impersonal, unlimited Consciousness itself.

> ‘Experiencingness’ or ‘Knowingness’ are synonyms for ‘Consciousness’.

> It is this agitation, the desire to experience Consciousness as an object, which seems to veil the experience of Consciousness knowing itself.

> The desire to experience Consciousness as an object comes from the belief that Consciousness is not already present. This belief is fuelled and substantiated by a deep sense of lack at the level of the body, the feeling, “I want something. I need something.”

> The clear seeing of these feelings reveals that they are in fact no more than neutral bodily sensations with no inherent power to generate thinking, desiring or fearing, let alone a sense of lack or separation. This downgrading of feelings to bodily sensations in our understanding, is accomplished effortlessly through clear seeing.

> However, we have forgotten that the real nature of this ‘I,’ of our Self, is Consciousness, the Presence that is witnessing and experiencing whatever it is that is being experienced in this moment. This presence of Consciousness stands alone, independent of any of the objects of the mind, body and world that appear to it, in the same way that a mirror stands alone, independent of whatever is reflected within it.

> This presence of Consciousness stands alone, independent of any of the objects of the mind,

> However, the body/mind does not witness or experience anything. It is itself witnessed, experienced. We experience the mind (thoughts and images) and the body (sensations) in just the same way that we experience the world (sense perceptions).

> We allow the mind, the body and the world to appear, to remain and to disappear in this presence of Consciousness. That is what they are doing anyway, so we simply cooperate with what is always already the case.

> The agitation of the mind, the body and the world appear in Consciousness, but Consciousness is not agitated by them.

> There is no mind as such. The existence of a mind is simply an idea, a concept. It is a useful concept but it is not a fact of experience.

> Likewise we do not experience the body in the way we normally conceive it. In fact there is no body as such. There is a series of sensations and perceptions appearing in Consciousness. And from time to time there is a thought or an image of a ‘body, ’ which is considered to be the sum total of all these sensations and perceptions.

**Note:** Losing oneself: blog

> However, this thought or image appears in Consciousness in exactly the same way as the sensations and perceptions to which it apparently refers. And this apparent body is made of the same substance as a thought. It is made of mind, taking mind in the broadest sense of the term, to include sensing and perceiving as well as thinking.

> If we stick closely to the actual experience of our bodily sensations, we see that they are shapeless and contourless. We may experience a visual perception of the skin and from several different perceptions conceive a well-defined border which contains all other bodily sensations. However, this conception does not describe the Reality of our experience. The visual perception of the surface of the body is one perception. A bodily sensation is another perception. When one of these perceptions is present the other is not. If they are both present, they are one perception, one experience.

> One perception cannot appear within another. All perceptions appear within Consciousness. We do not experience a sensation inside the body. What we call the body is in fact the experience of a sensation.

> We do not experience a sensation within a well-defined contour of skin. We experience a sensation within Consciousness and we experience a visual perception within Consciousness.

> Is not the actual experience of the body a collection of minute, amorphous, tingling sensations free-floating in the space of Consciousness?

> The continuity and coherence that we normally ascribe to the body, in fact belong to Consciousness.

> In fact our true body is Consciousness. It is Consciousness that houses all the sensations that we normally refer to as ‘the body.’

> Our true body is open, transparent, weightless and limitless. It is inherently empty and yet contains all things within itself. That is why such an empty body is also inherently loving. It is the welcoming embrace of all things.

> For instance, take a sound that is present now. Do we experience a boundary between that sound and the Consciousness that perceives it? Is there a border between them?

> The perception of a sound, the sensation that we call ‘my hand’ and the current thought, all appear free-floating in the same space of Consciousness. Is that not our actual experience?

> What is our actual experience of the boundary between what is ‘inside’ myself and what is ‘outside’ myself? There is no experience of such a boundary!

> Why do we think that the sensation we call our hand is closer to us than the sound ‘in the distance’? Is that our actual experience?

> Consciousness is not simply the witness but also the substance of every object that appears within it. Every object is made out of Consciousness. It is an expression of Consciousness.

> To begin with we understand objects as appearing to Consciousness. Then we understand that they appear in Consciousness. Then we understand that they appear as Consciousness. In this way Consciousness reabsorbs the body, the mind and the world into itself.

> Of course, it does not make sense to say ‘before,’ because when there are no objects there is no time, but we have to accept this limitation of language.

> It is not that Consciousness takes the object into itself. It is that Consciousness takes the shape of the apparent object, through the faculties of sensing and perceiving, and yet at the same time always remains itself.

> Initially Consciousness identifies itself with the object and in doing so it seems to forget itself. Later on, it takes the shape of the object without forgetting itself.

**Note:** Losing oneself: this. Precisely

> When Consciousness seems to forget itself, the ‘object’ is experienced as an object with its own apparent separate existence. When Consciousness takes the shape of the object without forgetting itself, the ‘object’ is experienced as an expression of Presence itself.

> Consciousness is always only itself and yet, in exclusively identifying itself with an object, the body/mind, it seems to become something. It seems to become an object.

> The fact that there is experience also tells us that there is something that is being experienced, that something is present. This something is the objective element in every experience. It is everything that is not ‘me,’ not ‘I,’ not Consciousness. We refer to it as ‘that’ or ‘it.’ We may not know what this ‘something’ is, yet there is no doubt that something is being experienced.

> Turning now to the objective aspect of experience, the mind and the senses are the instruments through which whatever is experienced, is known. They are the instruments of perception.

> The mind and senses are double agents. They work for both ignorance and understanding.

> We no longer feel that we are an entity located here and now, in the sense of being inside the body at a particular moment of time. Rather we come to understand the ‘now’ as timeless Presence, not a moment in time, and the ‘here’ as placeless Presence, not a location in space.

> The mind, the body and the world are understood to be expressions of Consciousness rather than distractions from it.

> A thought, a sensation, a perception and a dream are all made out of the same ‘stuff’ and they all appear in the same space. They are made out of and appear within the same Consciousness, and it is this same Consciousness that is present during the gaps between appearances and during objectless deep sleep.

**Note:** next new note? (after first set)

> It does not make sense to talk about the presence of Consciousness ‘at all times,’ because Consciousness does not exist in time. Time exists as an idea in Consciousness. However, we have to accept these limitations of language if we are to speak of Presence.

> After this timeless interval, Consciousness takes the shape of the next appearance and may identify itself with a part of this appearance, a body. In doing so it ‘forgets’ itself and thereby appears to veil itself from itself.

> This contracted ‘me,’ which is simply Consciousness-pretending-to-be-a-separate-entity, overlooks or forgets that the experience of Peace and Happiness is inherent in its own nature. Instead it seems to become an intermittent experience that can be lost and therefore every time we have the experience of someone or something that once made us peaceful or happy, but now makes us agitated or unhappy, should be enough to indicate that Peace and Happiness are not delivered by objects.

> However, it is not objects themselves that veil Peace and Happiness. It is the fact that we think and feel them to be objects, outside and separate from ourselves. With this feeling that objects are on the outside and separate, comes the corresponding thought and feeling that ‘I,’ the presence of Consciousness, is on the inside and is similarly separate.

> It is the experience that is revealed every time a desire comes to an end. Desire is agitation and Happiness is the ever-present background of all states that is revealed when this agitation ceases.

> Desire is agitation and Happiness is the ever-present background of all states that is revealed when this agitation ceases. Of course, it is also present during the agitation itself as it is the background of all states, but it is not experienced as such.

> The thought, sensation or perception reveals Consciousness in the same way that the reflection reveals the mirror.

> The object that appears in Consciousness is nothing other than Consciousness, in the same way that the object that appears in the mirror is nothing other than mirror.

> Our experience is one of a stream of appearances in Consciousness. These events are thoughts, feelings, sensations and perceptions, one following another... A, B, C, D, E... Each is utterly unique and each disappears absolutely before the next arises.

> However, when the hearing of rain is present, the ‘I’ thought is not. Likewise when the thought ‘Let’s have some tea’ is present, the ‘I’ thought is not. In between these two thoughts lies the timeless presence of Consciousness, the blue sky shining between the clouds. The ‘I’ thought is created to fill this interval, to impersonate the true ‘I’ of Consciousness

> experience is not a series of events appearing in Consciousness, but rather that it is Consciousness itself taking the shape of hearing, thinking, tasting, enjoying, perceiving, etc.

> Consciousness is not separate or removed from the object, perceiving it from a distance. When an object is present, that object is one with Consciousness. If they separate, the objective aspect vanishes utterly, instantly, whilst Consciousness remains as it always is.

> Language cannot describe this, because even in attempting to describe it there is a reference to two things, the object and Consciousness. Two words are used whereas in fact there are never two things.

> In fact, in the ultimate analysis, there are no objects. There is only Consciousness taking the shape of our experience from moment to moment

> The ‘I-am-the-body’ idea arises in Consciousness, just like any other appearance and, as such, it is the form that Consciousness takes at that moment. However, the fact that it arises in Consciousness doesn’t necessarily make it true, any more than the thought that two plus two equals five, which also arises in Consciousness, is true.

> It is an expression of Truth, but it is not true. The sensation or cluster of sensations that are referred to as ‘the body’ seldom appears without some perception of the world also. This conglomerate of sensations and perceptions is one seamless experience. However, Consciousness arbitrarily divides this seamless experience of sensations/perceptions into two, into sensation and perception. It does this by identifying itself exclusively with the sensations, with the body, and by disidentifying itself from the perceptions, from the world. It thinks, “I am this cluster of sensations, the body, but not that group of perceptions, the world.” Therefore, it is not so much the ‘I-am-the-body’ idea but rather the ‘I-am-only-the-body’ idea that is problematic.

> Consciousness is one with the totality of every experience, not just with a fragment, the body/mind.

> ‘I am not the body’ is true in that it suggests that ‘I,’ Consciousness, am not the body if by ‘body’ we mean an object that is outside and separate from Consciousness.

> The natural state is not to be exclusively identified with anything. It requires an effort to identify Consciousness exclusively with the body or the mind.

> From time to time old layers of identification with the body/mind reappear. However, they lose their separating power and with it their capacity to induce suffering.

**Note:** Losing oneself: identifying with body is this the transition?

> For that reason Love is said and felt to be unconditional, uncaused, unmodified, universal. It has no opposite. It is inherent in our true nature.

> However, as no objective content is present in this experience, there is nothing to be remembered ‘there.’ Nothing objective is experienced, so the mind, which comprises only objects, cannot lay claim to this experience. It was not present during it. There was no mind and therefore nothing to be remembered.

> As it reappears, the mind interprets this experience of the timeless presence of Consciousness as a blank, a void, because all it can know are objects. It would be more accurate to say that Consciousness represents this experience of its own formless presence, as a blank object in the mind. However, even a blank or a void is a subtle object.

> As a consequence of buying the ‘blank object’ theory in this way, the ‘I am not present’ theory, Consciousness is condemned to looking for itself within the realm of objects.


>In fact the experience of Consciousness knowing itself is always taking place. It is taking place in the absence of objectivity and in the presence of objectivity. That is why it is not quite true to say that Consciousness forgets itself. It would be more accurate to say that it pretends to forget itself.

>From the conventional point of view our experience consists of a multitude of different objects, comprising various combinations of mind, body and world. That is, it comprises thoughts, images, bodily sensations and sense perceptions.

>This little enclave of objects called ‘the mind and the body’ is given special status in this process of abstraction. It is partitioned off from all the other conceptualised objects and, strangely, it is given the status of subject. It is considered to be ‘me,’ whilst all the other conceptualised objects, including of course everyone else, are considered to be ‘other.’

>The concept of separate isolated objects is an interpretation of our experience. It is not a description of it. The interpretation is a useful hypothesis but it is a mistake to confuse the interpretation for the actual experience.

>The second thing that we learn from this exploration is that the boundary line we draw around a small enclave within the totality of our experience, and which we label ‘me,’ is an arbitrary one. It bears no relation to actual experience. For instance, it is not possible to draw a clear line between the body and the world.

>However, it is also in fact going too far to say that there is ‘one thing.’ As soon as we make an object of it, a subject is implied, and again we are in the realm of duality, of two things. So, ‘one thing’ implies ‘two things.’ As soon as we name it, however transparent the word we use, some degree of objectivity and, by implication therefore, subjectivity, is implied. At the same time we have to recognise that whatever it is that we are trying to speak about, is not ‘nothing.’ So let us refer to this as a ‘seamless totality’ or ‘Oneness,’ on the understanding that even these words confer a shadow of objectivity on that which cannot in any way be described by words or mind, and yet which itself illumines all words and minds.

>In order to make a more thorough exploration of the nature of our experience, we will again draw an artificial line within the seamless totality of experience, within this ‘Oneness,’ and provisionally separate the witnessing Consciousness from the witnessed mind/ body/world.

>This separation is conceptual only, for the sake of clarity and understanding. It never actually takes place.

>Within every experience there is something that perceives and there is something that is perceived, whatever that something is. Whatever it is that perceives is referred to as ‘subject’ and whatever is perceived is referred to as ‘object.’

>Again, we are in the realm of duality, of subject/object relationship. However, this time we are closer to the facts of our experience. This time Consciousness is the subject and the mind/body/world is the object. Previously the mind and body was the subject and the world, including others, was the object.

>So now we have divided the unity of experience into a subject, Consciousness, that witnesses, and an object, the mind/body/world, which is witnessed.

>Consciousness loses itself in the world of objects. The moment it turns its attention away from objects towards itself, it recognises itself. As it turns its attention more and more towards itself, it becomes absorbed in itself.

>The world of objectivity – or, rather Consciousness-lost-in-the-world-of-objectivity, which is represented by the son – is reintegrated with the father.

>Consciousness is the totality of our current experience, taking the shape of this current experience now and now and now.

>mind, and allows it to return to its true abode,

>We, Consciousness, take the position ‘I am nothing conceivable or perceivable.’

>There is never a true object of Consciousness and therefore Consciousness is never the subject of experience. Consciousness and its object are always one, beyond the realm of subject and object.

>It is the ‘I am the body/mind’ belief that gives rise to the ‘I am not the world’ belief. These two beliefs are co-created.

>As we fall asleep we first experience the withdrawal of sense perceptions or, more accurately, the faculties of perceiving and sensing. With the disappearance of perceiving, the world vanishes from our experience, and with the disappearance of sensing, the body vanishes from our experience, leaving only thinking and imagining. This is the dream state.

>The thinking and imagining functions are in turn withdrawn and, as a result, the dream state gives way to deep sleep. In deep sleep Consciousness simply remains as it always is, open and aware, only there are no objects present within it.

>Consciousness projects the appearance of the mind, body and world by taking the shape of thinking, sensing and perceiving. The process of falling asleep is not one of a separate entity transitioning through states. It is simply the withdrawal of this projection.

>The mind construes that the time it imagines to be real is an actual experience. It imagines that time is present in the absence of mind, in the absence of itself, and therefore imagines that deep sleep has duration. Deep sleep is therefore considered to be a state.

**Note:** LOS: thinking of time and tie w conversations with KC?

>Experiencing is the essential ingredient of the mind, the body and the world, and Consciousness is the essential ingredient of experiencing.

>Every experience that has ever occurred always occurs ‘Now.’ The past and the future are in fact never actually experienced. Thoughts and images about the past and future are experienced, but they always appear ‘Now.’

>In fact time is never experienced. Only ‘Now’ is experienced. Time is a concept, albeit a useful one, but it is not an experience. The concept of time is an experience but time itself is not.

>‘Now’ is ever-present. Was there ever a time that was not ‘Now’? ‘Now’ is not a moment. A ‘present moment’ is never experienced. A ‘present moment’ implies an infinitesimally short duration of time. Duration implies a before and an after, a past and a future. The ‘present moment’ is normally considered to be one of innumerable such moments that arise in succession ad infinitum.

>‘Eternity’ is a word that is used to indicate this ‘ever-present Now,’ and although it has become associated with an infinite amount of time, in its original meaning it is perhaps the closest word that is available to convey the immediacy and Reality of ‘Now.’

>These ‘moments’ in between the appearance of objects, whether thoughts, images, sensations or perceptions, are conceived of as gaps of minute duration that appear within the flow of experience.

>However, in attempting the impossible task of using mind to look towards that which is not an object, Consciousness is somehow undermining its habit of looking ‘outside’ and ‘elsewhere.’ The mind dissolves when it tries to see or touch that objectless place.

>Attention is Consciousness with an object. When the object vanishes, attention simply remains what it always is, Consciousness

>The Being that shines in all experience is known in ourselves as the experience ‘I am.’ In the world it is known as ‘It is.’

>We share the Presence that we are with all things.

>The mind, the body and the world do not obscure Consciousness. They indicate it. They reveal it. They express it.

>There is no purpose to meditation. The purpose is already accomplished. We are already what we are. We are already what we seek.

>However, it is artificial to divide our experience into two, into Consciousness and the mind/body/world, into the subject ‘I’ and the object, the mind/body/world. The reason for doing this is not to describe the Reality of our experience but rather to draw attention to the presence and primacy of Consciousness. Normally we are lost in objects, in the mind, body and world, and we are not even aware of the presence of Consciousness. So in order to see clearly that Consciousness is present in every experience, we take a step back, so to speak, from the objects of the mind, body and world. By doing this we establish that not only is Consciousness present in every experience, but that it is our primary experience. Once we have established the presence of Consciousness as a fact of actual experience, we can take another look at the mind, body and world from the point of view of Consciousness.

**Note:** LOS  it  is as if thr body as object is so clear but becoming a passenger is when the body loses its objwcthood. A path to consciousness.

>We can do the same experiment with a bodily sensation. Take the tingling sensation of the face. Where does that sensation appear? Is there an interface between the sensation and Consciousness? Does it not appear in the same place as thoughts appear? Does it not appear not just to Consciousness but within Consciousness?

>When thoughts, sensations and perceptions appear, they appear in Consciousness not just to Consciousness.


> It is not the world that contains the body, the mind and Consciousness. It is Consciousness that contains the mind, the body and the world, on an equal footing.

> The mind, the body and the world appear in Consciousness. That is our actual experience. It is not an extraordinary experience.

> This exploration about the true nature of experience can be taken further. Once it is seen clearly that thoughts, bodily sensations and world perceptions appear in Consciousness, we can investigate what is the actual substance of that experience, of that object. Take a thought, for instance. Is its substance different from the Consciousness in which it appears? Is there any difference between the actual sensation of the tingling in our fingers and the Consciousness in which it appears?

> it made of a substance that is different or distinct from the Consciousness in which it appears? Is there any difference between the actual sensation or perception and Consciousness itself?

> The very substance of every experience is the substance of Consciousness. Objects do not just appear in Consciousness they appear as Consciousness Consciousness does not just witness every experience, it expresses itself as every experience. Everything that is experienced is experienced by, through, in and as Consciousness.

> The apparent experience of a solid object is dissolved in this understanding, and is replaced by the understanding that we in fact experience a series of fleeting, insubstantial perceptions. It is in this sense that ‘everything falls apart.’

> Nature appears to us as form and concepts. Form is the raw data of the sense perceptions and concepts are the labels or interpretations, pieced together by the conceptualising power of mind.

> The image in the mirror is made only of mirror.

> Being without form, it cannot be said to have any limitations, because any limitation would have to have a form, would have to be experienced through the mind or the senses, in order to be an objective experience.

**Note:** LOS: limits of documentation

> If they have no objective qualities how can they be said to be separate or different? They cannot! Therefore, whether we realise it or not, in our actual experience they are one, Consciousness/Existence, not Consciousness and Existence.

> Nothing happens to Consciousness when a perception appears or disappears. It takes the shape of the perception but remains itself, just as a mirror takes on the appearance of an object and yet always remains exactly as it is.

> He did not say that art depicts Reality any more than literature describes it, but rather that it gives us a taste of Reality. It takes us to the direct experience, the intimate knowing that Consciousness, what we truly are, is the substance of Reality, that there is only one thing, that there is only Being.

> This is in line with Indian philosophy, which describes every experience as an expression of ‘nama rupa Sat Chit Ananda.’ ‘Nama’ is ‘name.’ It is that part of an experience that is supplied or conditioned by thinking. It could be called the concept, the label that the mind uses to frame the experience. It says, “That is a chair.” The concept ‘chair’ is nama. ‘Rupa’ is ‘form.’ It is that part of an experience that is supplied by the senses. Each of the senses has their corresponding object in the world. The sense of seeing has its counterpart in the objects of sight. The sense of hearing has its counterpart in the objects of sounds, etc. The senses condition the way Reality appears to us depending on their own characteristics. ‘Nama’ and ‘rupa’ together constitute the appearance of nature or an object.

> If we are to apprehend the real nature of experience, independent of the particular characteristics that are conferred upon it by the mind and senses, we have to denude our experience of that part of it that is supplied by the experiencing apparatus, the instruments of perception, that is the mind and the senses.

> The experience of this realisation is known in India as ‘Ananda,’ which has traditionally been translated as ‘bliss.’ However, this translation can be misleading. It suggests that the realisation of Oneness is considered to be accompanied by a rare and exotic state. And this in turn initiates the search for an extraordinary experience, for something that is not simply this.

> ‘Ananda’ is perhaps better translated as Peace or Happiness, or simply Fulfilment. In fact it is very ordinary. It could be described as the absence of agitation or the ease of Being.

> When we separate that part of our experience that is imposed or enclosed, as Blake put it, by the mind and senses, by the instruments of perception, Consciousness and Reality are realised to be one.

> Although all objects ultimately come from this experience and are therefore an expression of it, there is a particular category of objects that could be called sacred works of art, that shine with the presence of this understanding and therefore have the power to convey or communicate it directly. They evoke it. In classical Greece this experience was described as ‘Beauty.’

> Beauty is not the attribute of an object. It is inherent in the fundamental nature of experience. It is the experience of recognising that Consciousness and Reality are one.

> At some point, and that moment is always now, Consciousness begins to select some objects over and above others. Instead of allowing everything to flow freely through itself, as the creator, witness and substance of all appearances, it focuses on some objects in favour of others.

**Note:** LOS: fixation on the object of the body

> In order to substantiate this new status of separation, Consciousness bestows its ‘ever-presentness’ onto a small group of sensations that comprise the body.

> Consciousness bestows its identity exclusively on the body. It believes and feels, “I am the body.”

**Note:** LOS: over identification with body in dance?

> The open space of Consciousness begins to know itself again as a welcoming space in which everything is allowed to pass, as it will, when it will, where it will.

> The net of desires and fears is unstitched in this welcoming space and fewer and fewer objects are caught in it. In the end it is threadbare and what remains of its density is so permeated with space that it no longer has any power to separate anything from anything. The body returns to its original transparency, open, available, loving and acutely sensitive, but holding onto nothing. The mind is liberated from the tyranny of a separate self and becomes clear, lively and kind. The beauty and vibrancy of the world is restored.

> Upon waking from the dream we discover that the ‘individual person’ that seemed to be the experiencer of the dream was in fact experienced within the dream. However, upon waking we transfer the status of ‘experiencer’ from the ‘individual person’ who seems to be present in the dream to the ‘individual person’ who now seems to be present in the waking state.

> That is why the transitions from the waking state to the dream state and from the dream state to deep sleep, and vice versa, are considered in some spiritual traditions to be such significant opportunities for awakening.

**Note:** LOS: transition!

> In these transitions, that which is illusory in each state is laid bare. And, by the same token, that which is real in each state, that which does not disappear during the transition, is revealed.

> Imagine the first experience that ever appeared to us as a newborn infant or, even before that, the sensations and perceptions that appeared to us in the womb. Were we not present as Consciousness before and during that first experience? Must we not have already been present in order to be able to experience that first experience? And has our life since then not simply been a succession of appearances, all appearing to this Consciousness that we are?

> Of course it does not make sense to say ‘before that first experience,’ because there were, by definition, no objects present ‘then’ or ‘there,’ and without objects there is no time or space.


> All experience takes place here. This here is not a physical space. It is the space of Consciousness in which all experiences, including the apparent experience of space, takes place. A distant sound takes place here. The thought that subsequently conceives that sound to be at a distance from the perceiving Consciousness takes place in the same space as the sound itself. It takes place here. The chair on ‘the other side of the room’ is perceived here, in exactly the same place as the sound and the thought, at no distance from Consciousness. All bodily sensations take place in the same placeless place, which is here.

> This here is not a location inside the body. The body is a sensation inside this here, inside Presence.

> All experience takes place now. All memories of the past take place now. All thoughts about the future take place now. This now does not last in time. All time lasts in it.

> The mirror of Consciousness is the screen on which everything is experienced and, at the same time, it is that which experiences everything. The image that appears in the mirror is made only of mirror. Whatever appears in Consciousness is made only of Consciousness

> Rather, Consciousness takes the shape of the object, of the current experience, from moment to moment, whilst always remaining exactly as it is.

> As the water in the ocean rises and swells into the shape of a wave, flows for a while and then falls back into the ocean, without ever for a moment being anything other than water, so every object, every experience, arises within Consciousness, takes its unique shape, does its unique thing, and then offers back its name and form to the ocean of Presence, which abides in and as itself, before taking the shape of the next wave.

> The wave gives water a name and a form. When the wave vanishes, only name and form vanish. Water remains as it always is.

> The thinking mind is a series of abstract concepts with which we, as a culture, have agreed by common consent to represent our experience so as to enable us to communicate.

> The language of the mind does not deliver the object that it represents. It indicates it.

> The presence of a doubt indicates, by definition, the presence of a belief underneath it. Belief and doubt always come together. If a thought represents a fact, we know it, we do not believe it. And if we know it we do not doubt it. If we doubt it we do not know it. And if we do not know it, it is a belief and not a fact.

> The ‘dismantling of the edifice,’ the dismantling of that which prevents the man from seeing himself in the mirror, of that which prevents Consciousness from knowing itself knowingly, is, at the level of the mind, the investigation of our thoughts. Are they facts or are they beliefs? A thorough investigation of our ideas reveals most of them to be beliefs rather than facts.

> So the investigation into the nature of our experience involves the reduction, in our understanding, of apparent facts to beliefs and the subsequent reduction of beliefs to ideas.

> It is the freedom that Consciousness has from moment to moment: to create the idea that it is a separate, personal entity, to believe that idea, to forget that it has chosen to believe it and therefore consider it a fact, to explore the fact and rediscover that it is a belief, to stop believing it and realise again that it is simply an idea, and is, as such, one of many possible modes of being that Consciousness chooses from moment to moment, out of its own freedom.

> This is why Ramana Maharshi was often silent when asked a question. The highest answer to a question about the nature of Reality or the Self is always Reality or the Self itself, and this cannot be spoken of. So he would just remain silent.

> We are deceiving ourselves if we wash a veneer of ‘unknowing’ over deeply held beliefs and prejudices, or a veneer of ‘There is only one Consciousness’ over feelings that ‘I’ am this body or am in this body.

> It is an experiential exploration rather than a rational investigation into the nature of separation, and as such little can be said about it in rational terms, although some hints may be given. It is for this reason that not much is said in this book about this exploration at the level of the body.

> The belief in separation is the tip of the iceberg. The vast majority of the iceberg remains hidden underwater in the murky realms of feelings and bodily sensations.

> Every experience, every appearance, is a wave on the ever-present ocean of Presence.

> We do not experience a multitude of moments. We experience one ever-present Now. And this ever-present Now is coloured from time to time with apparent objectivity.

> The refraction of the screen into an apparent multiplicity of objects is in appearance only. We are in fact always seeing the screen. There is in fact only ever one thing that is present and the substance of that thing is only the screen.

> We cannot claim to be experiencing objects and Consciousness at the same time,

> Sooner or later Consciousness comes to see the difference between its own openness, its own Presence, which welcomes all things into itself with benevolent indifference, and a mind which, by definition, sees differences and yet has imposed on itself a straitjacket of ‘nonjudging.’ Such ‘non-judging’ comes from fear and confusion. It is not the true, benevolent indifference of Presence.

> With one exception, Reality cannot be touched by the mind, although the mind is always shining with its light, in the same way that the moon shines with the sun’s light. That exception is the thought about Reality itself. When we think about the nature of Reality, the mind comes to its own limit, because Reality is beyond the abstract concepts of the mind and therefore has no objective characteristics. It is like a man who runs towards a precipice and comes to the edge. If he proceeds he plunges into the void and dies.

> However, the essence of the experience, a moment of Consciousness knowing itself knowingly, is colourless and transparent, and therefore cannot be remembered.

> We do, however, remember the impact of this non-objective experience at the level of the body and the mind. This impact is often confused with the non-objective experience of Consciousness knowing itself and, as a result, these states of the body/mind become the object of intense seeking that sometimes lasts a whole lifetime.

> Consciousness is in the looking, not in the looked for.

**Note:** LOS: when become passenger consciousness we become the looking and there is no looked for

> There are no objects in deep sleep and therefore no boundaries, so Consciousness, Peace and my Self are identical.

> Every experience of the dream and waking worlds is only this ‘Consciousness-Peace-I’ taking the shape of thinking, imagining, sensing and perceiving.

> It is an alive, open unknowingness that is free to take any shape or any position at any moment, in relation to the moment itself.

**Note:** Freedom. Taking any shape  dancing

> In this way the teaching remains free of fixed formulations, dogma and fundamentalism. It remains fluid, playful, enjoyable, unpredictable and ungraspable. It always leaves us in open unknowingness.

> This open unknowingness is what we are. It is not something that we know.

> No formulation of the Reality of experience is completely true. Once we acknowledge this, we relieve words of the impossible burden of trying to express the true nature of experience and, as a result, leave them free to be spoken and heard in playful and creative ways that evoke Reality itself, but never try to frame or grasp it.

**Note:** Documentation

> You, Consciousness, are prior to experience. You, Consciousness, are not the result of an experience.

> Therefore your Being, your Reality, and the Peace and Happiness that are inherent therein, cannot be the result of a practice. Any so-called practice that aims for Happiness cannot be called spiritual. It is worldly. It is end-gaining. It is a perpetuation of the strategies of consolation and avoidance that characterise conventional life in the world.

**Note:** We are not seeking anything

> This unwinding of the tangled knot of seeking is the end of the conventional spiritual search. It is the deep understanding that nothing can be done as an individual, that the individual itself is a form of doing.

> What we previously thought to be ‘practice’ or ‘doing’ is no longer a choice. It is an impossibility. At the same time the offering of the body, the mind and the world to Presence becomes an inevitability.

> From the outside this may look like a practice, like something that an individual is doing for a desired end, and it may not differ outwardly from more conventional modes of spiritual seeking. However, it is nothing of the sort. They are worlds apart. In fact it is not even the offering of the body, the mind and the world. It is the reclaiming of the body, the mind and the world, their re-absorption into that from which they were never for a single moment separated. This should not really be called practice. It should be called love. In fact, it is love.

> However, if we explore the relative truth of both statements, we free ourselves from the dogma attached to either position and, in this case, the issue is transcended in Understanding rather than resolved in knowledge.

> Desire, at the level of the body, and seeking at the level of the mind are, in most cases, forms of agitation. They are modulations of a sense of lack, a sense that something is not right, that something needs to be secured or known.

> Happiness is another name for Consciousness. It is the particular name Consciousness gives itself when it experiences itself at the end of a desire.

> Likewise Understanding is another name for Consciousness. It is the particular name Consciousness gives itself when it experiences itself at the end of a thought.

> Seeking itself is simply the name and the shape that Consciousness takes as it sets out in search of itself.

> Happiness is not an experience that Consciousness has. It is what Consciousness is. That is why Joy is said to be causeless.

> Once we see clearly that it is the ending of desire, rather than its fulfilment, that reveals the inherent Happiness, we no longer search for an object to make us happy. We may desire an object with which to express Happiness, but this Happiness is not dependent on the object.

> Happiness, like Beauty and Love, is absolute, not relative. They are all inherent in Consciousness, and as such they do not change or disappear. They are the experience of Consciousness knowing itself, knowingly.

> When the mind dissolves at the end of a thought, Consciousness recognises itself, and this recognition is called Understanding. When the body dissolves at the end of a bodily sensation, Consciousness recognises itself, and this recognition is called Happiness or Love.

> When the world dissolves at the end of a perception, Consciousness recognises itself, and this recognition is called Beauty. The words Understanding, Happiness, Love and Beauty are all synonyms for Consciousness, for ‘I.’ They do not refer to objects.

> All objective experience – that is the mind, body and world – is made out of thinking and imagining, sensing, and seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and smelling. What happens to our entire objective experience, including all of our suffering, when all of these are removed? It vanishes.

> And if we go deeply into our experience at any given moment, we find that suffering is also non-existent there. In fact deep sleep and the present moment share much in common, whilst the past and the future have much in common with the dream state.

> Thinking, imagining, sensing, seeing, hearing, touching, tasting and smelling are the particular forms that knowing or experiencing takes.

> Theoretical understanding is only possible in relation to an object. That is because, when we think of an object, the mind forms an image or a concept of that object, but never actually comes in contact with the object itself.

> However, the thought about Consciousness is different. The mind cannot represent that which has no objective qualities, so when it goes towards Consciousness, it collapses. It just cannot go there. How could a three-dimensional object enter a two-dimensional plane? How could a two-dimensional plane enter a one-dimensional point? And how could the one-dimensional object of mind enter the zero-dimensional space of Consciousness?

> From the mind’s point of view, it is the end of seeking, rather than its fulfilment, that brings about the revelation of Presence

> Understanding, which is not a knowing of something, but rather Knowingness itself, permeates every aspect of our life from an unknown direction. It just happens naturally.

> Advaita, Non-Dualism, is not a bland whitewash of all the individual elements in each of our characters. In fact it is rather the opposite. Individuality means un-divided. Individuality is the unique expression of the undivided whole, which each body/mind expresses, and it tends to flourish rather than diminish, when we are relieved of the strait-jacket of ignorance – that is, when we stop ignoring our Self.

> Similarly, Non-Dualism is not an immunisation against feeling. In fact it is the opposite. It is complete openness, sensitivity, vulnerability and availability.

> Actually, suffering is our resistance to feeling, rather than a feeling itself.

> So we don’t try to use this Understanding. We allow it to use us. We allow it to shape our life. We don’t put it into another straitjacket and dictate how it should operate.

> Much of the mind’s activity is designed to avoid feeling. For instance, any form of repetitive, compulsive thinking is usually a sign that just below its surface lies an uncomfortable well of feelings. However, sooner or later, these uncomfortable feelings begin to percolate through the strategies and coping mechanisms that the mind has constructed.

> The welcoming space of our own Awareness, which once seemed to be in the background or even eclipsed by these all-consuming feelings, begins to emerge and, as a result, the feelings begin to recede. In fact, they don’t really recede. Devoid of the mental commentary that previously gave them meaning and validity, they are experienced more and more as innocuous bodily sensations.

> The idea that time is like a container, that houses all the events of our lives is in fact a temporal representation of Consciousness, in the mind.

> Events do not appear in time and objects do not appear in space. They both appear in Consciousness.

> The separate self is one such dot, given apparent continuity by the presence of Consciousness. As Einstein said, “The separate self is an optical delusion in Consciousness.”

> However, even if for the time being, we provisionally grant the existence of objects, the essential ingredient of every experience is Consciousness itself. This is easy to check for ourselves by asking what would happen to experiencing if an object, such as this book, were now to be removed. Nothing! It would continue, although it would have a slightly different character. However, what would happen to experiencing if Consciousness were to be removed? It would vanish absolutely. So the experiencing part of an object belongs to Consciousness, not to the object, if such an object exists. So in deep sleep, when Consciousness is, so to speak, all alone, with no objective content, the Experiencingness of Consciousness remains exactly as it always is, pure experiencing.

> Consciousness is Experiencingness and because Consciousness is always present, so experiencing is always present. How could this Experiencingness not be experiencing itself all the time?

> The mystic tends to start with the investigation into the nature of the Self. The artist tends to start with the investigation into the world. But both ultimately arrive at the same conclusion, that Consciousness is the fundamental Reality of the world, that Consciousness and Being are one.

> Consciousness has become so accustomed to shrinking itself into the frame of a body and a mind that the release from this self-contraction is often accompanied by a sense of elation or expansion.

> However, at times Consciousness divides the totality of experience into two camps. Everything that is part of the ‘not me’ camp is called ‘the world.’ Everything that is part of the ‘me’ camp is called ‘the body/mind.’

> This cycle of projecting the mind, body and world every morning and withdrawing the projection every night, as well as many other times during the day, continues in exactly the same way even when Consciousness has come to recognise its own unlimited Freedom.
