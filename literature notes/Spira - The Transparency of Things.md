# Rupert Spira - The Transparency of Things – Contemplating the Nature of Experience

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

> From an early age we are encouraged to formulate our experience in ways that seem to express and validate it, and these expressions subsequently condition the way the world appears. ‘David loves Jane,’ ‘Tim saw the bus.’ Our earliest formulations divide experience into ‘I’ and ‘other,’ ‘me’ and ‘the world,’ a subject experiencing an object. From that time on, our experience seems to validate these formulations. However, at a certain stage it begins to dawn on us that these formulations do not express our experience, but rather they condition it.

> The essential discovery of all the great spiritual traditions is the identity of Consciousness and Reality, the discovery that the fundamental nature of each one of us is identical with the fundamental nature of the universe. This has been expressed in many different ways. ‘Atman equals Brahman.’ ‘I and my Father are one.’ ‘Nirvana equals Samsara.’ ‘Emptiness is Form.’ ‘I am That.’ ‘Consciousness is All.’ ‘There are not two things.’ ‘Sat Chit Ananda.’

> The meaning of the words is not in the words themselves. Their meaning is in the contemplation from which they arise and to which they point. The text, therefore, is laid out with lots of space in order to encourage a contemplative approach.

> The new formulations are perhaps closer or more accurate expressions of our experience than the old ones, but their purpose is not to replace the old certainties with new ones. They simply lead to an open Unknowingness, which can be formulated from moment to moment in response to a given situation, including a question about the nature of experience. There are many ways to come to this open Unknowingness, and the dismantling of our false certainties through investigation is just one of them that is offered here.

> And yet at the moment when the paper is indicated, we seem to experience something new. We have the strangely familiar experience of becoming aware of something which we were in fact already aware of. We become aware of being aware of the paper.

> The paper is not a new experience that is created by this indication. However, our awareness of the paper seems to be a new experience.

> Now what about the awareness itself, which is aware of the paper? Is it not always present behind and within every experience, just as the paper is present behind and within the words on this page? And when our attention is drawn to it, do we not have the same strange feeling of having been made aware of something that we were in fact always aware of, but had not noticed?

> Is this awareness not the most intimate and obvious fact of our experience, essential to and yet independent of the particular qualities of each experience itself,

> Is this awareness itself not the support and the substance of every experience in the same way that the paper is the support and the substance of every word?

> Does anything new need to be added to this page in order to see the paper? Does anything new need to be added to this current experience in order to become aware of the awareness that is its support and substance?

> Likewise, having noticed the awareness behind and within each experience, do we lose sight of that awareness when we return the focus of our attention to the objective aspect of experience? Do we not now see the two, the apparent two, Awareness and its object, simultaneously as one? And has it not always been so?

> Does the content of each experience affect the awareness in which it appears?

> Every experience only expresses Awareness or Consciousness, although experience itself is infinitely varied.

> Awareness or Consciousness is the open Unknowingness on which every experience is written. It is so obvious that it is not noticed. It is so close that it cannot be known as an object and yet is always known. It is so intimate that every experience, however tiny or vast, is utterly saturated and permeated with its presence.

> Duality, the subject/object polarization, is inherent in the concepts of the mind. For instance, when we speak of the ‘body’ we refer to an object, which in turn implies a subject. If we explore this object we discover that it is non-existent as such and is in fact only a ‘sensation.’

> However, a ‘sensation’ is still an object and further exploration reveals that it is in fact made of ‘sensing,’ of ‘mind stuff,’ rather than anything physical. However, ‘sensing’ in turn is discovered to be made of ‘knowing.’ And if we explore ‘knowing’ we find that it is made of Consciousness. If we explore Consciousness we find that it has no objective qualities. And yet it is what we most intimately know ourselves to be. It is what we refer to as ‘I.’ And if we explore ‘I’ we find it is made of... The abstract concepts of the mind collapse here. They cannot go any further. There is no adequate name for that into which the mind dissolves. We are taken to the utmost simplicity of direct experience.

> Mind describes the names and forms through which That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named refracts itself, in order to make itself appear as two, as many, in order to make Consciousness/Being appear as Consciousness and Being.

> However, by speaking in this way, mind is being used to create evocations rather than descriptions of the experience of Consciousness knowing itself.

> These evocations are temporary expressions of That-Which-Cannot-Be-Named, like flowers blossoming for a moment, shedding the perfume of their origin on the Garden of Unknowing.

> This clear seeing is not an intellectual understanding, although it may be formulated provisionally in intellectual terms when required by the current situation. Rather, it is the direct, intimate and immediate knowing of ourselves resting in and as the formless expanse of Presence, and simultaneously dancing in the vibrancy and aliveness of every gesture and nuance of the body, mind and world.

> We start with experience and stay close to it. We do not start with a theory, a model, a map or a teaching, and then try to fit our experience into that model. Absolutely nothing is taken for granted.

> It is the same with our experience. The contemplations in this book are like MRI scans of our experience. They look at experience from many angles, spreading it out, opening it up. However, our experience itself is always one.

> It is sometimes thought that this kind of enquiry is intellectual and abstract and seems to bear little relation to our day-to-day experience. However, it is only because our conventional dualistic concepts about the nature of Reality are themselves so densely interwoven with abstract and erroneous ideas that they require some meticulous deconstruction.

> However, it is precisely the idea that the body and the world exist as objects in time and space, independent and separate from Consciousness, that is intellectual and abstract. It is not based on experience. And by the same token, the idea that there is only the experience of Consciousness knowing itself in and as objects, becomes a self-evident, obvious and indisputable fact of experience.

> The body and the world continue to appear in the same way, but it is clearly seen that the experience of the appearance of the body and the world takes place simultaneously with the experience of Consciousness knowing itself. It is the same experience, one experience.

> What do we know about Consciousness? We know that Consciousness is, and that everything is known by and through it. However, Consciousness itself cannot be known as an object.

> If we think that we know something objective about ourselves or the world, then whatever that something is that we think we know, will condition our subsequent enquiry into the nature of experience.

**Note:** Losing oneself : this is the bias of training

> Therefore the investigation into the nature of ourselves and of the world of objects initially has more to do with the exposure of deeply held ideas and beliefs about the way we think things are, than of acquiring any new knowledge. It is the exposure of our false certainties.

> We believe that we are the subject of our experience and that everything and everyone else is the object. We believe that we, as this subject, are the doer of our actions, the thinker of our thoughts, the feeler of our feelings, the chooser of our choices. We believe that this entity we consider ourselves to be, has freedom of choice over some aspects of experience but not others.

> We believe that objects exist independently of their being perceived, that Consciousness is personal and limited, that it is a by-product of the mind and that mind is a by-product of the body.

> The only field available for enquiry is experience itself. This may seem almost too obvious to mention, but its implications are profound. It implies that we never experience anything outside experience. If there is something outside experience, we have absolutely no knowledge of it, and therefore cannot legitimately assert that it exists.

> All experience takes place here and now, so the nature of Reality, whatever that is, must be present in the intimacy and immediacy of this current experience.

> Consciousness is in fact always knowing itself. However, through this deconstruction of concepts, Consciousness comes to recognise itself, not through the reflected veil of apparent objects, but knowingly and directly. Concepts are not destroyed in this process. They are still available for use when needed.

> Although this is never our actual experience, the mind is so persuasive and convincing that we have duped ourselves into believing that we actually experience these two elements, that we experience the world separate and apart from our Self, and that we experience our own Self as a separate and independent Consciousness.

> We are giving the mind credibility in spite of its limitations. We are acknowledging its ability to play a part in drawing attention to that which is beyond itself or outside the sphere of its knowledge.

> They are dissolved by our openness to the possibility that in this moment we actually experience only one thing, that experience is not divided into ‘I’ and other, subject and object, me and the world, Consciousness and Existence. We are open to the possibility that there is only one single, seamless totality, that Consciousness and Existence are one, that there is only one Reality.

> The edifice of dualistic ideas, which seems to be validated by experience, is well constructed with beliefs at the level of the mind and feelings at the level of the body, which are tightly interwoven, mutually substantiating and validating one another.

> Our experience itself does not change but we feel that it changes. Reality remains as it always is, for it is what it is, independent of the ideas we entertain about it.

> However, our interpretation changes and this new interpretation becomes the cornerstone of a new possibility. This new possibility comes from an unknown direction. It does not come as an object, a thought or a feeling. It is unveiled, in most cases, as a series of revelations, each dismantling part of the previous edifice of dualistic thinking.

> Consciousness veils itself from itself by pretending to limit itself to a separate entity and then forgets that it is pretending.


> However, it may be revealed by it. Understanding is often preceded by a line of enquiry and can subsequently be formulated by the mind. Such a formulation, which comes from understanding and not from concepts, has the power to take us to the experience of Reality. Through its reasoning powers the mind is brought to its own limit and, as a result, the edifice of mind collapses. This is the experience of understanding, the timeless moment in which Consciousness is revealed to itself. Consciousness perceives itself. It knows itself, knowingly.

> I, this Consciousness that is seeing these words and experiencing whatever it is that is being experienced in this moment, is not located inside a mind. The mind is not located inside a body and the body is not located inside a world. The body is simply the sensation of the body and the world is simply the perception of the world.

> Take away sensing and perceiving from the experience of the body and the world, and what objective qualities are left of them? None! Sensations and perceptions are made out of mind – that is, they are made out of sensing and perceiving. There is no other substance to them other than sensing and perceiving.

> However, we have said that this space is, like Consciousness, endowed with the capacity to experience, that it is an ‘experiencing space.’ So to look for itself is unnecessary because it is, by definition, already perceiving itself. It is already experiencing itself, because that is what it is. Its nature is ‘experiencing.’

> Its being itself is the knowing or experiencing of itself.

> Consciousness is transparent, colourless, Self-luminous, Self-experiencing, Self-knowing, Self-evident. That is our experience in this moment. Consciousness is known as Omnipresence, because there is nowhere where Consciousness is not. It is not that Consciousness is everywhere. It is that every ‘where’ is in Consciousness. Consciousness is known as Omniscience, because whatever is known is known by and through Consciousness. It knows all that is known.

> It is known as Omnipotence, because whatever appears depends solely on Consciousness for its Existence. Whatever appears emerges out of, is sustained by and is dissolved into, Consciousness. Consciousness creates everything out of it own Being.

> When we say that the mind can explore its limits we are really saying that Consciousness, the Knowingness that is Consciousness, takes the shape of abstract thinking and, through this shape, explores its own capacity to represent itself in the abstract terms of thought.

> During the appearance of mind, That-Which-Is-Ever-Present is the substance of that appearance and yet is apparently disguised as such. In this case Consciousness fails to recognize itself. However, once this understanding, this Self-recognition, has taken place, Consciousness no longer needs to forget itself during the appearance of the mind (or the body or the world). It recognizes itself in and as the activity of the mind as well as in its absence.

**Note:** Losing oneself: role of body

> Meditation is simply to abide as oneself. We remain as we are and allow the mind, the body and the world to appear and disappear without interference. If there is interference, then that is understood to be part of the mind’s activity and is allowed to be exactly as it is.

> Our objective experience consists of thoughts and images, which we call the mind; sensations, which we call the body; and sense perceptions, which we call the world. In fact we do not experience a mind, a body or a world as such. We experience thinking, sensing and perceiving.

**Note:** Losing oneself: this is so clear

> Consciousness is what we are, and to be as we are is the highest form of meditation. All other meditations are simply a modulation of this meditation of abidance as we are.

> Normally we are only aware of the known, but when attention is drawn to the presence of the Knower, to that which knows and experiences, whatever that is, it immediately becomes obvious that there is something present that is conscious of the body, the mind and the world.

> The Knower is Consciousness. It is that which knows and experiences. It is this Consciousness that we refer to when we say, ‘I.’

> When it is said, “We give our attention to that which is known,” it means that it is ‘I,’ Consciousness, that gives its attention to that which is known.

> So when it is said, “We give our attention to the Knower, to Consciousness,” it means in practice that ‘I,’ Consciousness, withdraws its attention from its exclusive focus on the known, on objects.

> The mind is a series of abstract concepts that appear within Consciousness. Every thought is an object and therefore the objectless Consciousness in which thoughts appear can never itself appear as a thought.

> When we think of anything other than Consciousness (or Truth or Reality or whatever word is used) we end up with a concept, an idea of that thing, which is not the thing itself. It is a representation of that thing in the mind’s code – that is, it is a concept.

> However, the thought about Consciousness or Reality is unique amongst all thoughts. When we try to think of Consciousness, it is like looking into a black hole. It is not even black. The mind simply cannot go there. It cannot go to that objectless place because the mind is itself an object. How could an object fit into a space that has no dimensions?

> So as the mind tries to turn itself towards Consciousness, it dissolves. It is consumed in what is, from its own point of view, the nothingness of Consciousness. However, its dissolution is the revelation of Presence, the revelation of that in which thought dissolves.

> Nothing objective is known in this placeless place of Consciousness. It is a knowing but not a knowing of something. It is pure Knowingness.

> A time comes when the thought gives up its last layer of objectivity and merges into Presence. In fact it is Presence that gradually gives up identification with subtler and subtler layers of objectivity, until it comes to recognize thought as its very own self. The mind does not find Truth. It does not find Reality. It is dissolved in it.

> Understanding is the dissolution of the mind into its support, into its ground. It is the experience of Consciousness knowing itself, returning to itself knowingly.

> Once we have fully understood that meditation is not an activity, the activity that we previously considered to be meditation will naturally come to an end. At that point, the understanding that meditation is not an activity has fulfilled its purpose and can also be abandoned.

> This open, free, unlimited Consciousness has contracted upon itself. It has seemingly shrunk itself into the narrow frame of a body and a mind, and limited itself to a tiny location in a vast space and into a brief moment in an endless expanse of time.

> At the level of the body these contractions are made out of bodily sensations with which Consciousness identifies itself. They are the apparent location of ‘I’ inside the body.

> In spite of this there are frequent intrusions into its own self-generated isolation which remind itself of its real nature... the smile of a stranger, the cry of an infant, an unbearable grief, a brief desireless moment upon the fulfilment of a desire, a moment of humour, the peace of deep sleep, a pause in the thinking process, a memory of childhood, the transition between dreaming and waking, the recognition of beauty, the love of a friend, a glimpse of understanding.

> Consciousness projects this current experience out of itself. It then loses itself in this projection, in the mind/body/world that it has projected from within itself, and identifies itself with a part of it. It is as if it says to itself, “I am no longer this open, free, unlimited Consciousness. Rather I am this limited fragment that I have just created within myself. I am a body.” In doing so Consciousness forgets itself. It forgets its own unlimited nature. This forgetting is known as ‘ignorance.’ It is Consciousness ignoring itself.

> The impulses to search, to seek, to avoid, to pretend, to contract, keep appearing but Consciousness is no longer compelled by them. It recognises the impulses but no longer acts on them. And, as a result, the frequency and ferocity of these impulses begin to subside.

> Consciousness no longer goes out of itself towards things. It stays at home within itself and things come to it. Things – that is, thoughts, feelings and perceptions – come to it, appear to it, arise within it, but Consciousness no longer needs to forget itself in order to experience the body, the mind and the world.

> Consciousness realises that the separate entity that it previously took itself to be, is in fact simply an activity that it does, from time to time. And by the same token, it realises that the activity that it seemed to do from time to time, the activity that we call meditation, is in fact what it always is.

> It realises that meditation is not a state that comes and goes, but that it is that in which all states come and go.

> From the point of view of ignorance, the ‘person’ is what we are and ‘meditation’ is something that we do from time to time. From the point of view of understanding, ‘meditation’ is what we are and the ‘person’ is something that we do from time to time.

> Ego is not an entity. It is an activity. It is an optional activity of identifying itself with a fragment that Consciousness is free to make or not, from moment to moment. It is the activity of thinking and feeling that ‘I,’ this Consciousness that is seeing and understanding these words, am only this body/ mind and not anything else that ‘I’ perceive.

> This thought and feeling arises within Consciousness and is an expression of Consciousness. It is the activity of Consciousness pretending to be a body and a mind, and then forgetting that it is pretending and, instead, actually thinking and feeling that it is a body and a mind.

> Consciousness has to go further and rediscover its absolute identity with all things. It has to discover that ‘I am everything,’ that this Consciousness here is identical with that Reality out there. In other words it has to discover that it is impersonal and unlimited.

> We have no evidence of a world that exists outside our experience of it. Nor is it ever possible to have such an experience, because experience itself is the touchstone of evidence.

> Imagine that you have spent your whole life living in a large house serving a demanding old man who lives in a room on the top floor.

> Our subservience to a separate entity consists, at the level of the mind, in the belief that ‘I’ am a separate, personal entity, and at the level of the body, as a feeling that ‘I’ am this body, or ‘I’ am in this body.

> As a pedagogical tool, the Advaita or non-dual teaching sometimes refers to Consciousness and its contents, the appearances that arise within it, as two separate elements. This establishes the independence of Consciousness from appearances and the dependence of appearances on Consciousness.

> The shape of the wave is the form that the water takes. It is the form of the appearance. ‘Wave’ is its name. But the content of that appearance is not wave. It is water. Similarly, in order to ‘appear,’ Consciousness ‘clothes’ itself in name and form. It takes the shape of an appearance by projecting itself through mind and senses. However, the content of every experience is Consciousness itself.

> So objects – that is, thoughts, sensations and perceptions – are not the content of Consciousness. Consciousness alone is the content of Consciousness. Thoughts, sensations and perceptions are the names and forms that Consciousness takes in the process of manifestation.

> One who is fearful of leaving his home projects all sorts of unpleasant things onto the outside world in order to justify his desire to remain indoors. Everything he sees and hears of the outside world seems to justify his attitude towards it and it will be very difficult to persuade such a person that it is in fact his attitude of fear that causes the world to appear in a certain way, rather than being the result of the way the world inherently is. In the same way Consciousness becomes accustomed to thinking and feeling that it lives inside the body/mind and it substantiates this habit with layer upon layer of belief and feeling. Once it has taken this position, its experience seems to substantiate the truth of its beliefs and feelings.

> Suffering is already a rejection of the current situation, a lack of acceptance of the current situation as it is. This rejection is the counterpart of Consciousness’ exclusive identification with a body/mind. That is what suffering boils down to.

> This so-called acceptance of the rejection of the moment is not the true, impartial, benevolent welcoming of everything within Consciousness. It is fear dressed up as understanding, pseudo Advaita. As such it is the very activity of ego itself, perpetuating its own isolation and misery.

> In the same way, every experience is only the presence of Consciousness shining. We do not have to go anywhere else, or do anything else to know or experience this. It is all we ever experience.

> From the point of view of mind, objects veil Consciousness. From the point of view of Reality, objects reveal Consciousness.

**Note:** Love Love this point of view re different perspectives

> The screen is in fact never obscured by the appearance of the game. It is all we ever see. We just sometimes fail to notice it. The players seem to obscure the screen but in fact they do not. Rather they reveal it. However, in doing so, they do not reveal something that is hidden. They reveal something, the screen, that is always in plain view, that is always being perceived, but is sometimes not noticed.

**Note:** Losinh oneself - can i construct similar framing re movement ? This is what movement does. It's The football game.

> Having said that, turning off the television is necessary, in most cases, to draw attention to the presence of the screen, to show that the screen was there first, to show that the players depend on the screen but that the screen does not depend on the players.

> It is only Presence that is dancing in this and every moment.

> From the point of view of ignorance, Consciousness seems to take on the qualities of the body/mind. That is, it seems to become personal and limited.

> From the point of view of understanding, our true body and our true mind is impersonal, unlimited Consciousness itself.

> ‘Experiencingness’ or ‘Knowingness’ are synonyms for ‘Consciousness’.

> It is this agitation, the desire to experience Consciousness as an object, which seems to veil the experience of Consciousness knowing itself.

> The desire to experience Consciousness as an object comes from the belief that Consciousness is not already present. This belief is fuelled and substantiated by a deep sense of lack at the level of the body, the feeling, “I want something. I need something.”

> The clear seeing of these feelings reveals that they are in fact no more than neutral bodily sensations with no inherent power to generate thinking, desiring or fearing, let alone a sense of lack or separation. This downgrading of feelings to bodily sensations in our understanding, is accomplished effortlessly through clear seeing.

> However, we have forgotten that the real nature of this ‘I,’ of our Self, is Consciousness, the Presence that is witnessing and experiencing whatever it is that is being experienced in this moment. This presence of Consciousness stands alone, independent of any of the objects of the mind, body and world that appear to it, in the same way that a mirror stands alone, independent of whatever is reflected within it.

> This presence of Consciousness stands alone, independent of any of the objects of the mind,

> However, the body/mind does not witness or experience anything. It is itself witnessed, experienced. We experience the mind (thoughts and images) and the body (sensations) in just the same way that we experience the world (sense perceptions).

> We allow the mind, the body and the world to appear, to remain and to disappear in this presence of Consciousness. That is what they are doing anyway, so we simply cooperate with what is always already the case.

> The agitation of the mind, the body and the world appear in Consciousness, but Consciousness is not agitated by them.

> There is no mind as such. The existence of a mind is simply an idea, a concept. It is a useful concept but it is not a fact of experience.

> Likewise we do not experience the body in the way we normally conceive it. In fact there is no body as such. There is a series of sensations and perceptions appearing in Consciousness. And from time to time there is a thought or an image of a ‘body, ’ which is considered to be the sum total of all these sensations and perceptions.

**Note:** Losing oneself: blog

> However, this thought or image appears in Consciousness in exactly the same way as the sensations and perceptions to which it apparently refers. And this apparent body is made of the same substance as a thought. It is made of mind, taking mind in the broadest sense of the term, to include sensing and perceiving as well as thinking.

> If we stick closely to the actual experience of our bodily sensations, we see that they are shapeless and contourless. We may experience a visual perception of the skin and from several different perceptions conceive a well-defined border which contains all other bodily sensations. However, this conception does not describe the Reality of our experience. The visual perception of the surface of the body is one perception. A bodily sensation is another perception. When one of these perceptions is present the other is not. If they are both present, they are one perception, one experience.

> One perception cannot appear within another. All perceptions appear within Consciousness. We do not experience a sensation inside the body. What we call the body is in fact the experience of a sensation.

> We do not experience a sensation within a well-defined contour of skin. We experience a sensation within Consciousness and we experience a visual perception within Consciousness.

> Is not the actual experience of the body a collection of minute, amorphous, tingling sensations free-floating in the space of Consciousness?

> The continuity and coherence that we normally ascribe to the body, in fact belong to Consciousness.

> In fact our true body is Consciousness. It is Consciousness that houses all the sensations that we normally refer to as ‘the body.’

> Our true body is open, transparent, weightless and limitless. It is inherently empty and yet contains all things within itself. That is why such an empty body is also inherently loving. It is the welcoming embrace of all things.

> For instance, take a sound that is present now. Do we experience a boundary between that sound and the Consciousness that perceives it? Is there a border between them?

> The perception of a sound, the sensation that we call ‘my hand’ and the current thought, all appear free-floating in the same space of Consciousness. Is that not our actual experience?

> What is our actual experience of the boundary between what is ‘inside’ myself and what is ‘outside’ myself? There is no experience of such a boundary!

> Why do we think that the sensation we call our hand is closer to us than the sound ‘in the distance’? Is that our actual experience?

> Consciousness is not simply the witness but also the substance of every object that appears within it. Every object is made out of Consciousness. It is an expression of Consciousness.

> To begin with we understand objects as appearing to Consciousness. Then we understand that they appear in Consciousness. Then we understand that they appear as Consciousness. In this way Consciousness reabsorbs the body, the mind and the world into itself.

> Of course, it does not make sense to say ‘before,’ because when there are no objects there is no time, but we have to accept this limitation of language.

> It is not that Consciousness takes the object into itself. It is that Consciousness takes the shape of the apparent object, through the faculties of sensing and perceiving, and yet at the same time always remains itself.

> Initially Consciousness identifies itself with the object and in doing so it seems to forget itself. Later on, it takes the shape of the object without forgetting itself.

**Note:** Losing oneself: this. Precisely

> When Consciousness seems to forget itself, the ‘object’ is experienced as an object with its own apparent separate existence. When Consciousness takes the shape of the object without forgetting itself, the ‘object’ is experienced as an expression of Presence itself.

> Consciousness is always only itself and yet, in exclusively identifying itself with an object, the body/mind, it seems to become something. It seems to become an object.

> The fact that there is experience also tells us that there is something that is being experienced, that something is present. This something is the objective element in every experience. It is everything that is not ‘me,’ not ‘I,’ not Consciousness. We refer to it as ‘that’ or ‘it.’ We may not know what this ‘something’ is, yet there is no doubt that something is being experienced.

> Turning now to the objective aspect of experience, the mind and the senses are the instruments through which whatever is experienced, is known. They are the instruments of perception.

> The mind and senses are double agents. They work for both ignorance and understanding.

> We no longer feel that we are an entity located here and now, in the sense of being inside the body at a particular moment of time. Rather we come to understand the ‘now’ as timeless Presence, not a moment in time, and the ‘here’ as placeless Presence, not a location in space.

> The mind, the body and the world are understood to be expressions of Consciousness rather than distractions from it.
