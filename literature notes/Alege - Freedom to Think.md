# Freedom to Think the Long Struggle to Liberate Our Minds by Susie Alegre

The rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief and freedom of opinion are absolute rights protected in international law. Without freedom of thought or opinion, we have no humanity, and we have no democracy. Making these rights real requires three things: 1.   the ability to keep your thoughts private; 2.   freedom from manipulation of your thoughts; 3.   that no one can be penalised for their thoughts alone.


Voltaire’s Candide declared proudly that ‘I read only to please myself and enjoy only what suits my taste.’ In the twenty-first century, it is increasingly difficult for any of us to do otherwise.


What could be more human and intimate than thought? People feel they have nothing to hide when you talk about privacy. But if you talk about freedom of thought, how many of us are really prepared to admit ‘I have nothing to think’?


While the idea of privacy feels closed, introspective and exclusive, designed to constrain and obscure the self, keeping others out, the idea of freedom of thought is expansive, exploratory and open. It is the space to discover new ideas, try on new viewpoints, be scurrilous, irreverent and naughty, profound and pompous, in order to understand our place in the world around us. Freedom of thought is a voyage of discovery and privacy is the tollbooth.


But we do not have to learn to live with a system that denies our dignity.


The idea of freedom has been harnessed and corrupted to represent a selfish individualism that has little to do with the ideal of liberty that set us on the road to legally enforceable human rights.


We need freedom of thought to combat climate change, racism and global poverty, and to fall in love, laugh and dream. The right to freedom of thought is an individual right, but it is crucial to the cultural, scientific, political and emotional life of our societies. Freedom of thought gives us the chance to think ugly thoughts and push them away before we act on them or let them take root; it allows us to choose how we behave to others, to moderate our speech according to the context and the audience, and to be ourselves. Freedom of thought lets us imagine new futures without having to prove them first. It keeps us dynamic and adventurous; it keeps us safe; and above all, it keeps us human.


Chafee knew only too well that ‘the inclination of men who obtain the power to govern is to use that power for the purpose of controlling not only the actions but the thoughts of men’.4


The right to freedom of thought, religion, conscience and belief along with the closely related right to freedom of opinion are fundamental but often overlooked pieces in the universal human rights jigsaw. They are the inner freedoms that allow scientific progress, artistic inspiration, emotional fulfilment, political engagement and spiritual enlightenment


In 1791, the French feminist activist, philosopher and writer Olympe de Gouges, recognising the limitations in male political Enlightenment thinking, penned the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen,11 demanding equality between the sexes and expanding the provisions in the Declaration of the Rights of Man to include women. Rather than being supported in expanding the concept of freedom, she was convicted of treason based on her political writing, and executed.


Reason and conscience are a defining feature of the human person protected by international human rights law against both the materialist threat of the West and the potential for tyranny of the masses that he perceived from communism


Ren is a fundamental principle of Confucianism, and has been translated variously as ‘humaneness’, ‘benevolence’, ‘empathy’ and ‘co-humanity’.


Confucianism identifies reflection as the noblest route to wisdom.


And Finnish international law professor Martin Scheinin, a former UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism and former member of the UN Human Rights Committee, in his commentary on the UDHR, suggests that freedom of thought, conscience and religion taken together cover all possible attitudes towards the world and society, protecting the ‘absolute character of the freedom of an inner state of mind’.


The rights that protect our freedoms to think for ourselves have a dual aspect: the internal practice of thinking and the external aspect of sharing our thoughts. There is a clear distinction between what goes on inside my head and the way my thoughts, beliefs and opinions are manifested in the outside world. Human rights law treats those inner and outer freedoms quite differently.


The space inside my head is the place where I can practise being human, apply my reason and morality (or lack of it) to problems, work through the bad ideas and let off steam without any consequences for anyone but myself. I can think unspeakable things so long as they remain unspoken.


Freedom of thought and freedom of opinion give us the space to decide whether to shut up or speak out.


We need to own our rights to freedom of thought and opinion and take action to defend them before it is too late.


The notion that there exist dangerous thoughts is mistaken for the simple reason that thinking itself is dangerous to all creeds, convictions, and opinions. Hannah Arendt


Take Hypatia of Alexandria, in ancient Egypt, a mathematician, astrologer, scientist and philosopher. One of the few female thinkers of antiquity whose life and work are relatively well documented, she was a Neoplatonist pagan with her own school and was tolerant of other faiths. She taught Christians and pagans alike while establishing herself as a person of significant political influence. But tolerance was no protection against religious violence, and Hypatia met her death in 415 ad at the hands of a mob of Christians who felt that her paganism and scientific beliefs were a threat to their religious institutions


into the Dialogue if they were so inclined. His protestations


His protestations of innocent thought did not save him, though. He was found to be ‘vehemently suspect of heresy’, required to ‘abjure, curse and detest’14 those opinions and sentenced to indefinite imprisonment.15 Not having been found guilty of heresy itself, he narrowly avoided a sentence of torture or even capital punishment. But he was held under house arrest for the rest of his life and died nine years later knowing that he was right. In a famous portrait attributed to the seventeenth-century Spanish painter Murillo, an exhausted Galileo holds a nail and looks wistfully at the words he has carved into the wall of his prison cell, ‘E pur si muove’ (‘And yet it moves’) – the rebellious barb he is said to have muttered after renouncing his opinions before the court.16 Galileo would no doubt have approved of George Orwell’s assertion: ‘Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.’


The purge of free thinkers in Ethiopia in 1630 led Yacob to hide out in a remote cave for two years, protecting his ideas from the imported intolerance and developing the rationalist philosophy he went on to transcribe in his Hatata, a collection of philosophical investigations into the nature of knowledge and of God. Yacob believed that reason was supreme, that all religions and doctrines could be open to critique, but that the existence of a creator god was the most rational explanation for our existence.


In 1610, a Dutch religious group known as the Arminians wrote a ‘Remonstrance’ explaining the ways in which their beliefs differed from the orthodox Calvinism of the state. They argued for religious tolerance on the basis that faith was a matter of individual conscience and so should not be subjected to the power of the state. Unfortunately for them, in 1618, the national synod took a different view, finding that their tolerant opinions could simply not be tolerated. As a result, they were purged from political and intellectual positions of influence while their leader was put to death.


As he put it, ‘If men’s minds were as easily controlled as their tongues, every king would sit safely on his throne … for every subject would shape his life according to the intentions of his rulers, and would esteem a thing true or false, good or evil, just or unjust, in obedience to their dictates.’


It is not only laws and political or religious institutions that can limit our freedom; the threat of social ostracisation can be enough for most people to limit what they allow themselves to think or feel. But for Mill, inner freedom was not something he could give up.


Sadly, Harriet only survived another seven years, dying of a wasting disease the year before Mill finally published On Liberty, which was dedicated to the woman who had shared his intellectual love of freedom and driven his belief in true equality of the sexes. For Mill and Taylor, freedom of thought included the freedom to love no matter what anyone else thought of them. It was their experience of the pressures of social constraints that drove their understanding of what liberty means in practice.


He was particularly concerned with the interaction between personal thought and society, noting the crushing effect that public opinion could have on individual freedom of thought.


He was particularly scathing of English society, which he said ‘practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself’.


As Mill noted, ‘there have been, and may again be, great individual thinkers, in a general atmosphere of mental slavery. But there never has been, nor ever will be, in that atmosphere, an intellectually active people.’


Freedom implies the possibility of change, and Mill recognised explicitly that opinions change and become redundant and absurd as time moves on.


In 2020, 69 countries around the world still had criminal blasphemy laws, with Pakistan, Iran and Russia leading the scoreboard on the numbers of people prosecuted under laws that still carry penalties, including in some cases the death penalty, for daring to believe beyond the official religious doctrine.


But in the twenty-first century, we are no longer in control of the outward signs we leave of our inner worlds in the infinite constellations of our data trails. In the digital world, heretical thoughts may be inferred not only from what you say online, but also from what you search for and who you know.


The field of psychiatry epitomises the interconnection between the three aspects of freedom of thought: the right to keep your thoughts to yourself, the right not to have your thoughts manipulated and the right not to be penalised for your thoughts.


In ancient China, one lie detection test involved filling a person’s mouth with bread; if the bread was still dry after questioning, it was a sign that they were lying.


Torture may induce someone to say what their torturer wants them to, but that does not necessarily equate with the truth. But the legal prohibition on torture is not about reliability, it is about the inhumanity of torture and the way it destroys human dignity. Torture is an unacceptable way of getting to the truth, not because it does not work, but because it is something we cannot tolerate in human society.


The term ‘propaganda’ itself comes from Pope Gregory XV’s creation in 1622 of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide to propagate the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries


Freedom of information is key to freedom of opinion, because if you can control the information, you can control public opinion.


When stories started to come out of Germany in the 1930s about Nazi death camps and the horrific human experimentation that was being carried out, the public were reluctant to believe it. They might still hate Germans, but they did not want to be taken for credulous fools twice. Fake news not only makes you believe, it also makes you doubt everything.


The social psychologist Jonathan Haidt18 calls it ‘the hive switch’, the collective psychology that takes over when we gather together for a joint purpose. It is what Aldous Huxley called ‘herd poisoning’, which makes the individual escape ‘from responsibility, intelligence and morality into a kind of frantic, animal mindlessness’.


Through technical devices such as radio and loudspeaker 80 million people were deprived of independent thought. It was thereby possible to subject them to the will of one man … Today the danger of being terrorized by technocracy threatens every country in the world. In modern dictatorship this appears to me inevitable. Therefore, the more technical the world becomes, the more necessary is the promotion of individual freedom and the individual’s awareness of himself as a counterbalance.24

**Note:** Albert Spear


But Huxley identified ‘man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions’ – or, as professor of law Tim Wu puts it, our ‘incredible, magnificent power to ignore’25 – as one of the biggest threats to human freedom.


He saw that ‘a society, most of whose members spend a great part of their time, not on the spot, not here and now and in the calculable future, but somewhere else, in the irrelevant other worlds of sport and soap opera, of mythology and metaphysical fantasy, will find it hard to resist the encroachments of those who would manipulate and control it’,27 and predicted that in the future, the ‘punitive methods of 1984’ would ‘give place to the reinforcements and manipulations of Brave New World’.


Huxley said that ‘only the vigilant can maintain their liberties’. In the era of clickbait and endless cat videos, we need to be more vigilant than ever.


The Scottish moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre questioned the whole basis of Enlightenment morality in his seminal work After Virtue, in which he concluded that belief in human rights was no more justified than belief in unicorns. But the thing about philosophers is that you can generally ignore them with impunity. I never had much time for Nietzsche’s maxim that ‘sombre clothes and total muteness lead a woman to astuteness’.


People who do not believe in human rights have lost their faith because they do not think their own rights are in danger. Their loss of faith is a danger to us all.


So too with human rights: every time someone is persuaded those human rights do not exist, all our rights are under threat.


The concept of subliminal messaging raises a whole new aspect of the First Amendment – the right not to listen. The US constitution may not explicitly refer to the right to freedom of thought, but the right not to listen or to be free from unwanted speech is an essential part of the right not to have your thoughts, feelings, beliefs or opinions manipulated by others.


There are three reasons why the case matters so much for an understanding of human rights, including the rights to freedom of thought and opinion. Firstly, it is a vindication of the rights of the individual person against the tyranny of the masses. Just because the general public think something is a good idea does not make it so. As J. S. Mill so passionately argued, the views of society can be as oppressive to freedom of thought as the law itself.


Despite the apparent strength of protection contained in the rights, what has not been explored so far is what interference with those absolute rights might look like in the digital age. We don’t need new rights to deal with new realities; we just need to understand what the rights we have mean for us today.


We cannot allow freedom of thought to become an anachronism, a Luddite concept not suited for the modern age.


Researchers at Cambridge University (including Michal Kosinski, whose controversial research on politics and sexual orientation feature in later chapters) had discovered that analysis of the things you’ve ‘liked’ on Facebook was a pretty good predictor of your personality and other personal attributes based on the ‘Big Five’ personality traits of openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.


Consent is crucial in drawing the legal line around our inner lives. We cannot give consent to something we do not notice and are not aware of.


Freedom of thought and opinion gives us the right to decide which parts of ourselves we want to reveal about our inner worlds, and to whom. It lets us choose when it is safe to share what is going on inside our minds. Making these inferences on an industrial scale without consent is, effectively, a massive violation of the rights to freedom of thought and opinion. And it’s a violation that most of us are subjected to each time we interact with technology.


This research lights up the bottom line for social media companies – the business model is not about supporting community and connection; it is about understanding and exploiting how the user thinks and feels. How we think and how we can be made to think and behave is what is commercially valuable. Because if you can understand and control how we think and feel, you can control what we buy, what we do and how we vote.


Further research has shown that we feel social pain, albeit fleetingly, in our daily interactions when a stranger passes us without eye contact, or perhaps when the person we are with picks up their phone. It doesn’t even matter whether the perceived slight comes from someone we really, really don’t like. The connection between social and physical pain is apparently so intimate that actually taking painkilling medication has been found to reduce the social pain just as it does physical pain.


It is not what you say, it is what you do or don’t do, along with when, how and how often you do it. Our phones offer a window into what and how we think and how we can be manipulated. And we religiously carry them in our pockets to help them do it better.


And this hoovering up of our likes, our data and metadata, our searches, our idle notes, our daydreams, our downtime is an interference with our absolute rights to freedom of thought and opinion.


As technologist turned philosopher James Williams puts it: ‘The effect of the global attention economy – i.e., of our digital technologies doing precisely what they are designed to do – is to frustrate and even erode the human will at individual and collective levels, undermining the very assumptions of democracy. These are the distractions of a system that is not on our side.’15


Every time we interact, we teach the machine to interpret our thoughts more completely than we understand them ourselves.


It is a vision that resonates in the way our digital world is developing. Mindless messages are tailored to distract us, confirm our biases, inspire our consumer needs and control our emotional reactions by either reassuring us that everything will be OK or riling us up to hate the other. They are teaching children that their bodies are not perfect and that sex is meaningless, through endless access to porn and reality TV.


window into their minds for the short


Over the first two decades of the twenty-first century, the academic studies showing that voting intentions and political affiliations can be predicted based on physical responses in the brain or other parts of the body, even before people know it themselves, have fed into a nascent neuropolitical consulting industry.


However, certain prompts do seem to nudge us in one direction or another – for example, fear has a tendency to provoke more conservative responses, even in people with a liberal ideology.


International human rights law does allow for limitations on freedom of expression and the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, where restrictions are needed to protect the rights of others and for the protection of public health or morals.35


Amia Srinivasan, professor of social and political theory at Oxford University, has written about the challenges of the ‘porn wars’ in her illuminating essay ‘Talking to My Students About Porn’.40 She notes that a key issue is not just the nature of the sex portrayed in online porn, but the medium itself, pointing out that while filmed sex appears to open up a world of sexual possibility, instead, by exposure to sex on screen, ‘the sexual imagination is transformed into a mimesis-machine, incapable of generating its own novelty’.


But she also recognises that, ‘rather than more speech or more images, it is their onslaught that would have to be arrested’.


Looking at online pornography from the perspective of inner freedom, the right to cultivate your own sexual imagination rather than the right of others to impose their fantasies on you, could open up new possibilities for future generations


The mathematician Hannah Fry, in her book Hello World: How to Be Human in the Age of the Machine, explains how what you buy can be used as an indicator of your inherent reliability, with fresh fennel topping the chart.


But, as the Sun newspaper revealed in an investigation in 2018, the cost of insuring a car in the UK if your name is Mohammed is vastly higher than if your name is John. Comparing around 60 quotes for car insurance in different names, the newspaper revealed that the additional cost of driving while Muslim in Britain is up to £919, with Admiral the worst example.17 It seems that faith in the afterlife has ceased to be a sign of trustworthiness since the days of J. S. Mill.


Poverty law professor Michele Gilman has documented the ways in which ‘data-centric technologies add scope, scale, and speed to negative inferences about poor people’.


And researchers like Joy Buolamwini, founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, and Timnit Nebru, an AI ethicist, have laid bare the technical failings and bias in facial recognition, which is practically incapable of recognising Black women’s faces as women, or even as faces at all – an issue that Buolamwini describes as ‘the coded gaze’.16


We have the right to reveal what we think: we do it every day when we open our mouths to speak. But can we really ever be said to be consenting to the wholesale harvesting of our thoughts and emotions if we don’t understand what that means and how it works? And what happens when it becomes not a matter of high-end consumer choice, but a compulsory part of the state public health apparatus?


Selling mental health data is like auctioning the keys to our minds, and in this case, without our informed consent. It is hawking stolen property when the property in question is human dignity.


Selling this kind of information is effectively trafficking in mental states. And it puts public mental health at risk when, instead of opening up opportunities for people to get help to address their problems, it exploits and exacerbates them.


Research on ways to access our minds directly, bypassing our faculties for communication, brings up profound questions about what our humanity really means. But the truth is that for big tech, humanity is a commodity and BCIs just offer a much quicker and ultimately more efficient way of mining it.


Recognising the risks of human enquiry, UNESCO, along with its advisory body, the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology, developed a working definition of the ‘precautionary principle’ that is found in many international legal instruments relating to scientific developments, including those that affect our health: ‘When human activities may lead to morally unacceptable harm that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, actions shall be taken to avoid or diminish that harm.’29 Morally unacceptable harm would be harm that is threatening to human life or health, serious and effectively irreversible, inequitable to present or future generations or imposed without adequate consideration of the human rights of those affected.


line, even in the privacy of your own teenage bedroom; the feeling that in a very real sense, your curious childhood questions or your rebellious and difficult adolescent thoughts are being policed as thoroughly as if you had spray-painted them onto the side of a bus shelter. Imagine if you could never, ever dance as though no one’s watching.


The child rights organisation 5Rights described the children’s rights issues related to persuasive design in detail in its Disrupted Childhood report in 2018, including mental health and developmental impacts. They explain how, ‘The culture of excessive sharing, fuelled by persuasive technologies, has resulted in an epidemic of self-doubt, anxiety, low self-esteem and correspondingly aggressive behaviour among the young’, while the ‘opportunity cost of attracting and keeping children online impacts on their creativity, autonomy, memory, sleep and education’.26 And they cite academic studies, including a large-scale 2016 survey for JAMA Pediatrics, in which academics from King’s College, London found that ‘Bedtime use of media devices doubles risk of poor sleep in children.’


MIT professor Sherry Turkle has noted: ‘the capacity for boredom is the single most important development of childhood. The capacity to self-soothe, go into your mind, go into your imagination. Children who are constantly being stimulated by a phone don’t learn how to be alone, and if you don’t teach a child how to be alone, they will always be lonely.’


The CEO of Embodied, the company behind the robot, explained, ‘We’re at a tipping point in the way we will interact with technology. Moxie is a new type of robot that has the ability to understand and express emotions with emotive speech, believable facial expressions and body language, tapping into human psychology and neurology to create deeper bonds.’


We are yet to really understand and internalise the fact that every single engagement our children have in the connected online world is being used to monetise or restrict their futures, to capitalise on their hopes, dreams and deepest fears, and, ultimately, to buy or control their minds. Is this really something we are prepared to accept?


Two theories underpin these technological developments: determinism, ‘the theory that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes’;17 and behaviourism, ‘the theory that human behaviour is based on conditioning (mental training and the influence of habit), rather than being explained by thoughts and feelings’.18


Hannah Arendt noted, ‘the trouble with modern theories of behaviorism is not that they are wrong but that they could become true, that they actually are the best possible conceptualization of certain obvious trends in modern society. It is quite conceivable that the modern age – which began with such an unprecedented and promising outburst of human activity – may end in the deadliest, most sterile passivity history has ever known.’19


language of ethics rather than human rights that is being used to describe the landscape and define the boundaries of acceptability in the technology sphere. There are a plethora of regional and international ethical frameworks blossoming around the world. The digital rights NGO AlgorithmWatch has created a global inventory23 of ethical frameworks for AI.


You don’t need to be much of a cynic to see why ethical guidelines may be more palatable to big tech than actual regulation. Ethics are optional. They can be a good marketing tool, but you are never going to find yourself in court over a purely ethical dispute. Human rights law is ethics with teeth. We need to move the discussion back to the law, specifically human rights law, and we must make it work for us.


I spent many years writing papers that talked about personal data and its fundamental importance to our human rights, but it was always abstract, a technicality.24 By focusing on data, we are looking at the techniques companies use to get inside our heads, not the impact of it. When I started to think about digital rights in terms of freedom of thought, it suddenly felt acutely personal, fundamental and clear.


What does our acquiescence to the ubiquity of technology and mass surveillance in our lives mean for freedom of thought? Could it be said that, according to the principle that human rights are ‘living instruments’, the right to freedom of thought has lost its relevance and resonance in modern society? Are we consenting to the loss of freedom of thought? Does the backlash against human rights mean genuine freedom has gone out of fashion?


The foundation of the future must be human dignity and freedom, not corporate libertarianism or state totalitarianism. We need to reclaim the idea of freedom and ground it firmly in human rights, not robot rights, corporate interests or individualism. And we need to move beyond the narrow scope of privacy to a space where we can guarantee all rights – civil and political, economic, social and cultural, for all people, everywhere.


To begin with, we might not know where the limits of absolute protection in human rights law should be, but a good rule of thumb is that if it feels wrong, it probably is.


Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt famously said, ‘the Google policy on a lot of things is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.’ The legal line we need to draw around our inner freedom is that creepy line. Right now, Google and every other company whose business model relies on ‘surveillance capitalism’ is blurring the line into oblivion.


The line between what I think and what I express is an informed and uncoerced decision to share. When I tell you my secrets, I have decided that I want you to know them.


But genuine consent does not sit in a yellow button at the bottom of a long set of terms and conditions. Informed consent requires a comprehensive understanding of what it is that we are consenting to, now and in the future. It also requires choice and the realistic possibility of saying no.


Modern-day variations on physiognomy or phrenology that take our biometric information as an indicator of our inner lives should be prohibited by law. Automated assessments of criminality, political opinion or sexual orientation or other mental characteristics based on biometric information pose a fundamental threat to our freedom of thought. Judging our minds and our futures through our bodies should not be allowed. To be fully human, there must be parts of ourselves that should be simply unknowable.


Jaron Lanier is a pioneer of virtual reality and sometimes referred to as ‘the conscience of Silicon Valley’. He has described social media as ‘worse than cigarettes in that cigarettes don’t degrade you. They kill you, but you’re still you.’9 It is time for governments to call the big tech dogs off our inner freedom.


The former head of AI Ethics at Google and co-founder of the organisation Black in AI, Ethiopian-born Eritrean–American Timnit Gebru, has explained how her experience having to seek asylum, fleeing war as a political refugee at the age of 15, informs her work because she understands viscerally how division works.


And if you don’t like the way social media views you, you can start looking for ways to trip up the algorithm, like teenager Samantha Mosley and her friends, who created an elaborate technique of cooperative obfuscation to confuse Instagram so it couldn’t track and target them.


Understanding how to respond when social media presses your buttons is also crucial. If you feel under attack or overwhelmed whenever you check your feed, the organisation Glitch,27 set up by campaigner Seyi Akiwowo in response to her own experience of online abuse, can provide you with vital advice and tools for digital self-care.


And science journalist Catherine Price’s book How to Break Up With Your Phone offers a wealth of tips for managing your relationship with the tech in your pocket.


In late 2019, researcher Kate Crawford teamed up with artist Trevor Paglen to create ImageNet Roulette, part selfie app, part art installation, part political statement. ImageNet Roulette allowed you to upload a photo of yourself to get a read-out from a massive database of photos scraped from the net and labelled to teach AI what to think about people.


Depending on where you are, you can run the browser extension Who Targets Me33 to get a picture of how political parties are profiling and reaching you through social media.


Article 19’s focus on freedom of expression has expanded to explore concrete ways to protect freedom of opinion in the digital age too.
