> “Technological evolution” is, of course, a metaphor based on the processes of biological evolution. Not everyone, however, sees it as a metaphor. Kevin Kelly, who Wu cites in this second post, argues that technological evolution is not a metaphor at all. Technology, in Kelly’s view, evolves precisely as organisms do. Wu rightly recognizes that there are important differences between the two, however:
>  > “Technological evolution has a different motive force. It is self-evolution, and it is therefore driven by what we want as opposed to what is adaptive. In a market economy, it is even more complex: for most of us, our technological identities are determined by what companies decide to sell based on what they believe we, as consumers, will pay for.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09q9xn8tk6ntk1ac1btw7zm))


> And this leads Wu to conclude, “Our will-to-comfort, combined with our technological powers, creates a stark possibility.” That possibility is a “future defined not by an evolution toward superintelligence but by the absence of discomforts.” A future, Wu notes, that was neatly captured by the animated film *[WALL•E](https://substack.com/redirect/9f54ce09-7315-4d35-9bb6-1d713ee359ac?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* .

> Wu goes on to draw a distinction between demanding technologies and technologies of convenience. Demanding technologies are characterized by the following: “technology that takes time to master, whose usage is highly occupying, and whose operation includes some real risk of failure.” Convenience technologies, on the other hand, “require little concentrated effort and yield predictable results.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qdj8c2416em4780t4mnks))


> Of course, convenience technologies don’t even deliver on their fundamental promise. Channelling Ruth Cowan’s *[More Work For Mother: The Ironies Of Household Technology From The Open Hearth To The Microwave](https://substack.com/redirect/8e872736-d125-4a1a-aae5-7a72589d359c?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* , Wu writes,
>  > “The problem is that, as every individual task becomes easier, we demand much more of both ourselves and others. Instead of fewer difficult tasks (writing several long letters) we are left with a larger volume of small tasks (writing hundreds of e-mails). We have become plagued by a tyranny of tiny tasks, individually simple but collectively oppressive.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qez310m3rwgw7pe86kgbx))


> Toward the end of his post, he urges readers to “take seriously our biological need to be challenged, or face the danger of evolving into creatures whose lives are more productive but also less satisfying.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qfefvts05ct2x2vzd4cjc))


> I also encourage you to read the work of Albert Borgmann. I’m not sure if Wu has read Borgmann or not, but his discussion of demanding technologies was anticipated by Borgmann nearly 30 years ago in *Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry* . What Wu calls *demanding technology* , Borgmann called *focal things* , and these entailed accompanying *focal practices* . Wu’s *technologies of convenience* are instances of what Borgmann called the *device paradigm* . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qgk4rn5yw80jkcb02rgvv))


> Borgmann arrived at the device paradigm by first formulating the notion of *availability.* Availability is a characteristic of technology which answers to technology’s promise of liberation and enrichment. Something is technologically available, Bormann explains, “if it has been rendered instantaneous, ubiquitous, safe, and easy.” At the heart of the device paradigm is the promise of increasing availability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qjvn2w2xpyknwzeezva10))


> While devices tend toward technological availability, what things provide tend *not* to be instantaneous, ubiquitous, safe, or easy. The difference between a thing and a device is a function of the sort of engagement that is required of user. The difference is such that *user* might not even be the best word to describe the person who interacts with a thing. In [another context](https://substack.com/redirect/0508aa54-12e6-40bd-97b4-8b2de815c9cc?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) , I’ve suggested that *practitioner* might be a better way of putting it, but that does not always yield elegant phrasing.

> A thing, Borgmann writes, “is inseparable from its context, namely, its world, and from our commerce with the thing and its world, namely, engagement.” And immediately thereafter, Borgmann adds, “The experience of a thing is always and also a bodily and social engagement with the things world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qsp45n0q2erwnspkgatcr))


> The evolution of modern technology is characterized by the progressive concealment of the machinery and the increasingly available commodity. “A commodity is truly available,” Borgmann writes, “when it can be enjoyed as a mere end, unencumbered by means.” Flipping a switch on a thermostat clearly illustrates this sort of commodious availability, particularly when contrasted with earlier methods of providing warmth.

> Ultimately, we do all need a set of what Borgmann elsewhere calls *counter-practices* , a set of deliberately chosen practices that refuse the default settings of the device paradigm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09qxzgdxcybwsnxt2vjcgwy))


> “Physical engagement is not simply physical contact,” Borgmann explains, “but the experience of the world through the manifold sensibility of the body.” He then adds, “sensibility is sharpened and strengthened in skill … Skill, in turn, is bound up with social engagement.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09s073zkpxabzd7ecwp6jeb))


> Borgmann’s vision of a richer, more fulfilling life secures its greater depth by taking seriously both our embodied and social status. This vision goes against the grain of modernity’s account of the human person grounded in a Cartesian dismissal of the body and a Lockean conception of the autonomous individuality.

> Against these, Borgmann opposes troubles that we ought to accept in practice and in principle. Here the examples are might be the preparation of a meal or hiking a mountain. These sorts of troubles or challenges, not altogether without their real dangers, could be opposed in principle — never prepare meals at home, never hike — but such avoidance would also prevent us from experiencing their attendant joys and satisfactions. If we seek to remove all trouble or risk from our lives; if we always opt for convenience, efficiency, and ease—if, in other words, we aim indiscriminately at the frictionless life—then we simultaneously rob ourselves of the real satisfactions and pleasures that enhance and enrich our lives, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h09s6q9hhyf63sbreksbb8ft))
