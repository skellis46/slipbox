> Neurophenomenology uses phenomenological investigations of the phenomenal structure of subjective experience to guide neuroscientific investigations of the brain activity subserving consciousness (see, e.g., [Lutz et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib59), [Rainville and Price, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib69)).

> During both unreflective everyday experience (walking the dog, watching the rain fall, daydreaming, etc.) and more constrained mental activity (self-conscious reflection, attentive concentration, etc.), the dynamical aspect of our conscious experience is pervasive and unavoidable. Whether we are startled by a unique and surprising event, such as a thunder clap, or we are following the ongoing train of ideas during a lecture, our experience seems always to be on the move. Yet we can recognize not only an ongoing movement or flow, but also a certain standing now or present moment, which seems always there—or rather *here*—invariant throughout the flow. These two structural features of our experience—a standing now and an ongoing flow—are central to both [James, 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib40), [Husserl, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib36) analyses of consciousness.[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#fn1) According to [Husserl (1991)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib36), they form one unified phenomenal structure, which he calls the standing-streaming structure of time-consciousness (see [Zahavi, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib91), [Zahavi, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib92)). To set forth a phenomenological framework for our treatment of binocular rivalry in this paper, let us highlight a few basic features of this phenomenal structure.
