# Petitmengin et al - Studying the experience of meditation through Micro-phenomenology

_previous note:_

LLM: 

Claire Petitmengin’s paper argues that first-person experience can be studied rigorously, but only if researchers abandon casual introspection and use carefully structured methods that help people access aspects of experience that are normally unnoticed or poorly articulated. She shows that everyday descriptions tend to rely on ready-made concepts and narratives, which flatten or distort what actually happened. To counter this, she outlines interview techniques that slow down recall, bracket interpretation, and guide attention toward the micro-dynamics of experience – such as shifts in attention, bodily sensation, imagery, timing, and felt sense. These methods aim to stabilise experience as an object of inquiry without reducing it to pre-existing theoretical categories.

The paper also addresses common objections to first-person methods, including concerns about subjectivity, unreliability, and lack of scientific validity. Petitmengin argues that these problems are not inherent to first-person data but arise from poor methodological design. When elicitation techniques are precise, repeatable, and explicitly taught, they can generate consistent structures across participants and sessions, making experiential data analysable and comparable. She positions this work as complementary to third-person and neurophysiological approaches, not opposed to them, and suggests that careful study of lived experience is essential for understanding consciousness, skill, and sense-making in domains where meaning emerges before it is conceptualised or verbalised.
