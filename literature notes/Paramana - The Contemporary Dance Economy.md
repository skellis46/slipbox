# Paramana - The Contemporary Dance Economy

> ‘[t]he body is less able to live and breathe in harmony with other bodies’, due to the ‘precarisation (continuous competition between bodies) of work and daily life’. Accelerated rhythms, competition, and precarity are characteristics of most contemporary westernised societies in the twenty-first century. Several thinkers have argued that these are a result of the currently globally dominant economic system, neoliberal capitalism (for example, Harvey 2005; Žižek 2010; Barnett 2010).– Berardi, in Paramana 2017 p76

-            I do find it hilarious how dance scholars seem to arrive at the same place: dance can save us. Dance is vital. It’s where Paramana starts and also Lepecki (Singularities).

> As time is accelerated and the political and economic landscape is shifting so quickly and so drastically, we find ourselves with not enough time to meet, think, organise, and act, but only respond with spasmodic, incomplete gestures. (Paramana, p.76)

- This is important in context of pandemic – it gave freelancers time to think. There was space and time. Message recently from a freelance friend: “I miss the lockdown spaciousness that allowed [the film project] to happen”

> How is the conduct of the dance field – in the different ways that Foucault is referring to it – affecting and affected by neoliberalism? What is dance’s role in the contemporary moment? Paramana, p.76

> Neoliberalism not only affects economies, but institutes ethics and rationalities, presenting the economic rationalization of relationships and the emphasis on personal responsibility and self-care as solutions to systemic problems.(Paramana, 78)

> Political scientist Wendy Brown, who builds on Foucault’s thinking, refers to Foucault’s understanding of neoliberalism as ‘a reprogramming of liberalism12. According to Foucault, whereas in liberalism the state was to not interfere with the market, in neoliberalism, the state does the work for it: it ‘govern[s] for the market, not because of the market’ and therefore society is regulated by it (the market). (Paramana, 78)

Biopolitics – chronic and inescapable form is tech. Zuboff. We turned to tech during pandemic (see IJSD latest issue). Neoliberal regulation/control par excellence. Almost entirely unregulated by Government (slowly changing). Hyper-individualism. Loneliness. Quintessential neoliberal experience.

> Neoliberalism, Brown suggests, drawing on Foucault, is concerned with ‘governing homo oeconomicus (and the economy as a whole) “without touching it”’,23 in the same manner that biopolitics is concerned with governing bodies from a distance. It does so by ‘taking the formal principles of a market economy and referring and relating them to. . . projecting them on to a general art of government’;24 by extending, in other words, the rationality of the market to all spheres of life – not necessarily by monetizing ‘all social conduct and social relations’, but by ‘cast[ing] them in an exclusively economic frame’ the dimensions of which are both epistemological and ontological. (Paramana, 79)

> According to Foucault’s work, Brown’s advancement of it, and Lemke’s aforementioned articulation, then, neoliberalism governs bodies from a distance by promoting certain kinds of conduct, by treating all areas of social life as markets, and promoting entrepreneurship, flexibility, mobility, risk, competition, and personal responsibility and self-care as solutions to systemic problems. Why is this thinking on neoliberalism and an understanding of how it works and what it does important to the dance world? How is dance affecting and affected by neoliberalism? (Paramana, 80)

- Worth remembering that we didn’t talk about choreography and art hardly at all with participants in Dance after Lockdown. They were conversations about survival.

> At Post Dance, he also recognises that (part of?) the younger generation in the field is behaving differently. That it is much more aware of the function of institutions and its role in it, and are socially engaged. (paramana 86)

> And all the economic consequences we must also discuss, and digest, and conquer. And a younger generation has arrived out of all this and invented their own means of distribution, collectively, below the market, beyond consensus, socially active, intelligent with institutions, refusing the iconic and post-nothing at all but only present, because they had to.55 (Burrows, in Paramana 86)

- really? Can we really say this? Just 6 years afterwards?

> Our body does not exist in a capsule; it exists in relation to other bodies. Our subject is relational and social. It is therefore impossible to consider the body without considering other bodies and the relation we have to the specific sociohistorical, economic and cultural context. (Parmana 87)

- I suspect she is utterly underestimating the power of individualism at heart of neoliberal ‘project’. That even if we talk of a social body, how is that type of ‘social’ enacted or performed? Lip service to community. And this is because dance (and) art has long long been a market economy.

> As practitioners, being able to articulate verbally what we do and theorize our work is important not only for the dreadful funding applications, but also for how we want others to understand and engage with our work, how we are respected as artists by other disciplines, and, therefore, what power we have in the arts and in society and how we can negotiate what we want and are entitled to – as artists and citizens. (Paramana, 89)

- This paragraph is loaded with entitlement (explicitly in last line). How dreadful? What does she mean? That they shouldn’t have to be written? What is implicitly being proposed here?

> And we need to be confident in what we do and assert ourselves. We do not need to be the underdog, the apologetic artist whose work is appropriated. (Paramana 89)

- But why are ‘we’ this way? What underpins this silence or reluctance? KP’s answer is to ‘engage with theory’. Yup. Staggering.

> Participants at PAF and SWSU advocated that the solution is a matter of self-organisation: creating collectives that function outside of the funding and programming system and that make it possible for artists to do all of the things they need and want to do as artists (for example, find a studio space, deal with administration work, fund the work, make and present it). Yes, but: is this not what neoliberal capitalism relies and thrives on? On our ability to use our entrepreneurial skills and self-organise, on our flexibility, willingness to often work without pay, take personal responsibility for systemic problems (for example, inadequate and/or unfair arts funding), (take) care (of/) for ourselves and survive without any help from the state, without the flimsy existing social net that is slowly, but surely, disappearing? Would we not be feeding neoliberalism if we just did that? It is absolutely necessary that, while we are attempting to ‘self-organise’ in order to survive, that we assert ourselves, and constantly put pressure for what is being taken away from us by neoliberal capitalism: the social net, the social services, the state funding to which we are all entitled. Understanding how neoliberalism works, how we are affected by it through the conducts it establishes and the rationalities that are inscribed in them and how we might be feeding it by reproducing certain forms of conduct, is therefore crucial to our actions, the way we practice our practice and therefore to the field’s advancement. It is for this reason that engagement with theory from dance and other disciplines, and political engagement are of utmost importance. (Paramana, 90)

> All of these are necessary to effect change in the contemporary moment, but we need to be aware of how and to what effect we use this knowledge to prevent being choreographed ‘according to the necessities of the global economy’, as Stefan Hölscher and Gerald Siegmund would also caution. (Paramana 91)

> It is about thinking and practicing first as citizens, then as artists, then as dance artists. It is about nuancing our role in these different roles, the intention and aim of our actions – because capitalism thrives on abstraction – having confidence, being able to articulate the importance of what we do, and realising that antagonism and dissensus are necessary ingredients for democracy. (Paramana 91)

- Theory is the greatest of abstractions. How does capitalism thrive on abstraction? Why aren’t we confident? Why can’t we articulate the importance of what we do? What kinds of nuances?
