# technologies as mediators of human-world relations

_previous note:_ [[technics, techne, and technology]]

Peter-Paul Verbeek's mediation theory views technologies as "as mediators of human-world relations."[^1] It is distinct from ideas that see technology as opposing human subjects or the means to extend human beings.

> Theoretically, it makes it possible to rethink central philosophical subfields, like epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics. If technological instruments help to constitute the reality observed by scientists, what does this imply for the status of their knowledge claims? If diagnostic and therapeutic devices inform the ethical decisions that we make, help to shift moral norms regarding the acceptability of suffering, and create new responsibilities, what does this imply for ethical theory?[^2]
