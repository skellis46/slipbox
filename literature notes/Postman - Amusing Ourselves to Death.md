# Postman - Amusing Ourselves to Death

Originally published in 1985.

## epistemic partiality and the pretense of certainty

> We are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators, meaning that none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept it.[@postman-2006-amusing p.6] 

The problem is not epistemic partiality but the pretense of certainty. We have much to learn from science.


## in every tool an idea is embedded that goes beyond its function

>But our media-metaphors are not so explicit or so vivid as these, and they are far more complex. In understanding their metaphorical function, we must take into account the symbolic forms of their information, the source of their information, the quantity and speed of their information, the context in which their information is experienced. Thus, it takes some digging to get at them, to grasp, for example, that a clock recreates time as an independent, mathematically precise sequence; that writing recreates the mind as a tablet on which experience is written; that the telegraph recreates news as a commodity. And yet, such digging becomes easier if we start from the assumption that in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself. [@postman-2006-amusing p.14]

>Indeed, our tools for thought suggest to us what our bodies are like, as when someone refers to her "biological clock," or when we talk of our "genetic codes," or when weread someone's face like a book, or when our facial expressions telegraph our intentions.[@postman-2006-amusing p.15] 

>A similar paradox exists in universities, and with roughly the same distribution of resonances; that is to say, there are a few residual traditions based on the notion that speech is the pri-mary carrier of truth. But for the most part, university concep-tions of truth are tightly bound to the structure and logic of the printed word. 20

>The answer he received took the following line: You are mis-taken in believing that the form in which an idea is conveyed is irrelevant to its truth. In the academic world, the published word is invested with greater prestige and authenticity than the spoken word. What people say is assumed to be more casually uttered than what they write. The written word is assumed tohave been reflected upon and revised by its author, reviewed by authorities and editors. 21

>the concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression. Truth does not, and never has, come un-adorned. It must appear in its proper clothing or it is not ac-knowledged, which is a way of saying that the "truth" is a kind [22] of cultural prejudice. Each culture conceives of it as being most authentically expressed in certain symbolic forms that another culture may regard as trivial or irrelevant. 23

>every epis-temology is the epistemology of a stage of media development. Truth, like time itself, is a product of a conversation man has with himself about and through the techniques of communica-tion he has invented. 24

>The printing press makes rather stringent demands on our bodies as well as our minds. 25

- he's talking about immobility. But the phone enables mobility. Mobile phone. 

>The first is that at no point do I care to claim that changes in media bring about changes in the structure of people's minds or changes in their cognitive capacities. There are some who make this claim, or come close to it (for example, Jerome Bruner, Jack Goody, Walter Ong, Marshall McLuhan, Julian 7 Jaynes, and Eric Havelock).  I am inclined to think they are right, but my argument does not require it. Therefore, I will not burden myself with arguing the possibility, for example, that oral peo-ple are less developed intellectually, in some Piagetian sense, than writing people, or that "television" people are less de-veloped intellectually than either. My argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of dis-course; it does so by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by demanding a certain kind of contentâ€”in a phrase, by creating new forms of truth-telling. I will say once again that I am no relativist in this matter, and that I believe the epistemology cre-ated by television not only is inferior to a print-based epistemol-ogy but is dangerous and absurdist. 27

>But there is still another reason why I should not like to be understood as making a total assault on television. Anyone who is even slightly familiar with the history of communications knows that every new technology for thinking involves a trade-
off. It giveth and taketh away, although not quite in equal mea-sure. Media change does not necessarily result in equilibrium. It sometimes creates more than it destroys. Sometimes, it is the other way around. We must be careful in praising or condemn-
ing because the future may hold surprises for us. The invention of the printing press itself is a paradigmatic example. Typogra-
phy fostered the modern idea of individuality, but it destroyed the medieval sense of community and integration. Typography created prose but made poetry into an exotic and elitist form of expression. Typography made modern science possible but transformed religious sensibility into mere superstition. Typog-
raphy assisted in the growth of the nation-state but thereby made patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. 29
