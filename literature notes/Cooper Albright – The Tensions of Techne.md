# Cooper Albright – The Tensions of Techne

_previous note:_ [[Gelassenheit]]


>Thus, as people around me chatted about so-and-so’s new film, or the latest politics of the latest curator at the latest screenings, I was busy looking out for the ways in which the act of filming dance was implicated in the screened representation and how the ubiquity of screens in contemporary dance affects how we watch movement. That is to say, I have become interested not only in what we are seeing (a particular filmmaker’s signature, the long shots, the jump cuts, the choreography, etc.), but in how the very structure of our seeing (both on and off the screen) has been affected by filmic technologies. As we enter the second decade of the twenty-first century, I believe that we must think seriously about the implications of the increasing presence of screens in the dance field as a whole. In other words, how has looking at dance on screen made us look at dance on stage differently? [p.21]

 >In his 1954 treatise, The Question Concerning Technology, philosopher Martin Heidegger connects the terms technology and technique with their etymological root, technē, an ancient Greek concept that refers at once to the skills of the artisan and the visionary power of the artist. Heidegger also links technē to episteme, a way of knowing the world. Thus dance techniques and media technologies are not simply about the capacity of machines (or even the dancer’s body-as-machine); they also concern how we come to know the world. For Heidegger, this knowledge is not a passive recognition of what already exists, but rather a method of “bringing forth,” a “revealing” of a truth.[p.21]

>Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the essence of technology so long as we merely conceive and push forward the technological, put up with it, or evade it. Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it. But we are delivered over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something neutral; for this conception of it, to which today we particularly like to do homage, makes us utterly blind to the essence of technology.[Heidegger, in @cooperalbright-2012-tensions p.22]
