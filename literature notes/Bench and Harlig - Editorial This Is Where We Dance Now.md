# Bench and Harlig - Editorial: This Is Where We Dance Now

> In 2020, the screen was seemingly the only venue, and its logics of geography and access to movement communities across the globe suddenly shifted in ways that will likely reverberate for years to come.[@bench-2021-editorial p.1]

> what it means to practice dance and screendance under what for most of us were unprecedented circumstances, when all dance became screendance.[@bench-2021-editorial p.2]

> For the most part, elements that defined internet-based screendance during the last year—dancing in homes, using outdoor spaces, sharing video on free platforms, and a strong “instructional force”6—all already existed.[@bench-2021-editorial p.2]

> All of this pre-pandemic dance online shows that in some ways, what has changed the most during this time is our perspective.[@bench-2021-editorial p.2] 

> But home is a different place now, as the authors in this issue demonstrate. We have also long danced with, via, and through the screen, but the screen, too, may be a different place, now that being on both sides of the screen is a familiar and embodied experience. Indeed, as the pandemic wore on and what we learned to call “Zoom fatigue” set in, we were also reminded in ordinary and extraordinary ways that we are bodily beings. Thus, opportunities for further research into the detrimental effects of screen use on the body arose, as well as investigations of how the screen can activate and convey deep, embodied realities.12[@bench-2021-editorial p.12]

> In a conversation with the editorial board, Claudia Kappenberg offered that “even though we are images, we are still bodies.”20 And we are in the midst of a period of deeply acknowledging embodiment, from human vulnerability to disease; to the uneven distribution of precarity along the lines of the violent legacies of colonization, enslavement, and genocide that continue to expose some to harm for the benefit of others; to the stakes of negotiating the freedom to move and the freedom to remain in place;21 to the use of motion tracking, surveillance, and artificial intelligence to aid governments, corporations, and institutions in interpreting, predicting, and managing [p.6] on- and offscreen actions. As the pandemic recedes, how will we critically analyze the body and screen practices that were normalized during 2020-21,22 and what new awareness will we bring to the practices we choose to retain, return to, or abandon? What do sustainable screendance practices look like post-pandemic?[@bench-2021-editorial pp.6-7]
