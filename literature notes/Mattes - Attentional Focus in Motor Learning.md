#  Mattes - Attentional Focus in Motor Learning, the Feldenkrais Method, and Mindful Movement


_previous note: [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

This article by Josef Mattes is a collection of ideas and research about the efficacy of Feldenkrais and how it might contribute to complicate understandings of internal and externals focuses of attention. It summarises literature and proposes some ideas (ie it is writing up a research project itself).

Mattes discusses Feldenkrais in relation to sport and sport psychology's growing interest in the efficacy of "mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches."[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258] He describes how _regular_ psychological skills training focus on changing the experiences themselves whereas mindfulness-based work in sports focuses on "changing the relationship to one’s inner experiences (thoughts, emotions, etc.)"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259] He makes an obvious link between this internal focus in mindfulness training with somatic practices and martial arts, and describes Feldenkrais as a "method of changing motor behaviour and function."[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259]

Gives overview of attentional focus and difference between external focus (on the movement effect) and internal focus (on body movement), and the advantages of an external attentional focus in motor learning and performance.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258] One of the criticisms of Feldenkrais (by Ives 2003) was that it was internally focused with an assumed "overemphasis on kinesthetic training"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259]. Mattes attempts to right this in part by suggesting that external focus of attention is actually an important part of motor learning in Feldenkrais. ^6a881c

> Given that mindfulness is widely defined as a particular way of paying attention (Baer, 2003) -- [in @mattes-2016-attentional p.259]

> One point of contact [between mindfulness training and somatic training] was made already several years ago, before the recent explosion in mindfulness research, when Buchanan and Ulrich (2001) described the Feldenkrais method (a “Western” form of mindful movement) in a tutorial and argued that it deserves scientific scrutiny as a method of changing motor behavior and function. This was criticized by Ives (2003) because of perceived lack of evidence for “physiological” changes in performance due to practising the Feldenkrais method, which in turn was explained by alleged internal, hence inappropriate, attentional focus as well as assumed overemphasis on kinesthetic training.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259]

> In fact, in both ATM and FI lessons, the goal is to expand awareness through movement (not movement with/through awareness) and integrating function in the sense of “using the whole self” in it: all parts of the body-mind work together harmoniously and efficiently in performing the function.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.261]

> As an aside, we might notice that such self-directed learning is consistent with the advantages of autonomy in motor learning (see e.g., Andrieux, Danna, & Thon, 2012; Chiviacowsky, 2014) since according to Andrieux et al. “the learner would be most adept at determining the optimal level of task difficulty,”[@mattes-2016-attentional p.261]

> Specifically, Ives (2003) claimed that the evidence at the time of his writing did not justify recommending the Feldenkrais method above other techniques, and further that “any effects noted appear to be psychological and not physiological.” As an example, he pointed to three studies on postural sway following Feldenkrais lessons that reported findings which were both conflicting and of small effect size. Trying to explain this apparent lack of effectiveness, he claimed that “[a]n essential factor in the Feldenkrais Method is its emphasis on self-awareness” and likened this to an internal focus of attention, which is inferior to an external focus in motor learning and performance.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.262]

- the distinction between changing the experiences themselves versus changing one's relationship to inner experiences is not so clear to me. It seems different from internal vs external focus of attention. I think I get it, then it slips away. That part is an example of writing crying out for an example! This doesn't help either:

> Ives (2003) was perfectly right in saying that a “strategy in which focus is placed on internal bodily sensations such as breathing, pain, and muscle tension [. . .] appears not in harmony with the desired outcomes of Feldenkrais lessons.” Precisely for this reason, the focus of attention in the Feldenkrais method is primarily on quality and ease of movement, hence external.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.267]

Although this helps a little bit:

> Already Buchanan and Ulrich (2001) quoted Feldenkrais as stating that “re-education of the kinaesthetic sense, and resetting it to the normal course of self-adjusting improvement of all muscular activity-the essence of life-is fundamental.” One may or may not agree that it is the essence of life, but “self-adjusting improvement” is precisely what mediates the usefulness of an external focus of attention in motor learning, according to the constrained action hypothesis.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.268]

However, Mattes does seem to be trying to wedge ATM into being an external focus of attention. My sense -- after only a bit of reading -- is that the external/internal focus of attention dichotomy is dependent (to some extent) on the degree of self-evaluation; perhaps even more so? Mattes says as much:

> Both the research by Neumann and Brown (2013) and the practical experience in the Feldenkrais method and in martial arts suggest that the effect of attentional focus is much more complicated than a simple internal/external dichotomy would imply. In line with the constrained action hypothesis, the crucial point is to deploy attention in a way that avoids triggering inappropriate interference with automatic (movement) processes. Depending on circumstances, this may be best achieved by focusing one’s attention on an object outside the body, by centering at the tanden while at the same time staying connected with the world, by paying attention to the ease and quality of the movement, or by a combination thereof.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.271]
