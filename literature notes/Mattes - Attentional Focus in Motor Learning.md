#  Mattes - Attentional Focus in Motor Learning, the Feldenkrais Method, and Mindful Movement


_previous note: [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

Mattes discusses Feldenkrais in relation to sport and sport psychology's growing interest in the efficacy of "mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches."[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258] He describes how _regular_ psychological skills training focus on changing the experiences themselves whereas mindfulness-based work in sports focuses on "changing the relationship to one’s inner experiences (thoughts, emotions, etc.)"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259] He makes an obvious link between this internal focus in mindfulness training with somatic practices and martial arts, and describes Feldenkrais as a "method of changing motor behaviour and function."[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259]

Gives overview of attentional focus and difference between external focus (on the movement effect) and internal focus (on body movement), and the advantages of an external attentional focus in motor learning and performance.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.258]

> Given that mindfulness is widely defined as a particular way of paying attention (Baer, 2003) -- [in @mattes-2016-attentional p.259]

> One point of contact [between mindfulness training and somatic training] was made already several years ago, before the recent explosion in mindfulness research, when Buchanan and Ulrich (2001) described the Feldenkrais method (a “Western” form of mindful movement) in a tutorial and argued that it deserves scientific scrutiny as a method of changing motor behavior and function. This was criticized by Ives (2003) because of perceived lack of evidence for “physiological” changes in performance due to practising the Feldenkrais method, which in turn was explained by alleged internal, hence inappropriate, attentional focus as well as assumed overemphasis on kinesthetic training.[@mattes-2016-attentional p.259]

> As an aside, we might notice that such self-directed learning is consistent with the advantages of autonomy in motor learning (see e.g., Andrieux, Danna, & Thon, 2012; Chiviacowsky, 2014) since according to Andrieux et al. “the learner would be most adept at determining the optimal level of task difficulty,”[@mattes-2016-attentional p.261]
