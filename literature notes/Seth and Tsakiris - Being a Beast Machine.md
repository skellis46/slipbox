# Seth and Tsakiris - Being a Beast Machine: The Somatic Basis of Selfhood

_previous note:_ [[allostasis and body budgeting]]

_chatGPT summary:_

> This research article explores how our sense of self is connected to the body, particularly how we process internal bodily signals. It introduces the idea of "instrumental interoceptive inference," which is about how the brain predicts and controls internal bodily states to maintain balance (allostasis). This approach helps explain why our sense of selfhood feels stable over time and doesn't feel like a mere object. The article also discusses how our emotional states are influenced by the brain's interpretations of bodily signals. Essentially, it suggests that our experiences of being and self-awareness are deeply tied to how our brain manages and interprets internal bodily information​. 

This contrast between the non-object-like character of self-hood and the perception of its stability over time is compelling:

> phenomenology of embodied selfhood, accounting for its non-object-like character and subjective stability over time. [@seth-2018-being p.969]

Seth and Tsakiris mention how "Experiences of having a body, and of ‘being a body’, are among the most basic aspects of conscious selfhood" [@seth-2018-being p.969] -- see [[an object of special regard]] for my mini-essay on this topic and also in [@wehrle-2020-being].

They discuss perception of the world through predictive processing (link to [[nondual awareness and predictive processing]]) "in which perceptual content is generally assumed to be conveyed by top-down predictions about the hidden causes of sensory signals" [@seth-2018-being p.970].
