# Galen Strawson - Things That Bother Me: Death, Freedom, the Self, Etc

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself - somatics chapter]]

## LLM summary 

- **Mortality:** Candid reflections on fearing death and how self-experience can blunt or intensify that fear.  
- **Free will & responsibility:** The “Basic Argument”: we lack ultimate moral responsibility, so desert-based blame/praise is misguided.  
- **The self ([[episodic vs diachronic self]]):** Challenges the “narrative self.” Strawson identifies as **episodic**—often not feeling continuous with past/future selves—and argues narrative isn’t required for a good, ethical, or intelligible life.  
- **Consciousness:** Pushes back on reductive materialism; seriously entertains panpsychism to treat experience as fundamental.  
- **Mind & mood:** Personal essays on depression and temperament—how inner weather shapes thought and philosophy.  
- **Literature & music:** Reads Nietzsche, Kafka, and musical experience to illuminate mental life and value beyond tidy life-stories.  
- **Style & stance:** Combative but humane—philosophy braided with memoir—aimed at unsettling fashionable certainties about how a life “should” hang together.

**Bottom line:** A sharp, personal case against narrative self-mythology and ultimate responsibility, urging us to take raw experience—and consciousness itself—dead seriously.
