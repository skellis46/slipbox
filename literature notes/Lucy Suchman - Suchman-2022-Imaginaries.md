## Highlights

> The current reanimation of artificial intelligence includes a resurgence of investment in automating military intelligence on the part of the US Department of Defense. (Location 16)


> I argue that the loop’s promise of dynamic homeostasis is held in place by the enduring premise of objectivist knowledge, enabled through a war apparatus that treats the contingencies and ambiguities of relations on the ground as noise from which a stable and unambiguous signal can be extracted. (Location 20)


> To challenge these technopolitics of violence we need a radically different kind of situational awareness, one that recognizes the place of ignorance in perpetuating the project of militarism. (Location 24)


> Building out systems of sensors, signal processing, data storage and transmission has proven more straightforward than the translation of data into what in military terms is named ‘actionable intelligence’. (Location 41)


> I extend this line of analysis to what I read as the re-articulation of closed world discourse in the current revival of AI, including the promise to delineate and dominate the theater of operations through data. I suggest that what holds this promise in place is the enduring premise of objectivist knowledge enabled through a war fighting apparatus that treats the contingencies and ambiguities of relations on the ground as noise from which a stable and unambiguous signal can be extracted. (Location 51)


> Within the closed-world imaginary, the task of military intelligence is to maintain a kind of dynamic homeostasis, nominalized in military discourse as ‘situational awareness’. (Location 59)


> These investigations provide evidence for the continued escape of conflict from the frames of rational action and control on which militarism depends, manifest in acts of extrajudicial assassination and the injury and death of those categorized as civilians. These accounts not only challenge the military’s attempt to make clean demarcations of enmity within complex relations of affinity and difference, but also offer an example of partial, specifically situated and highly illuminating knowledge-making practices outside of the military’s imaginaries of omniscience. They make evident that rather than perfect information, those imaginaries are founded on expedient and systemic ignorance. (Location 69)


> The commitment to close the world drives the technosolutionism offered most recently by AI. To challenge that we need a radically different conception of situational awareness, in the form of public debate and a re-envisioning of the future place of the US in the world, founded in comparable investments in creative diplomacy and a transition to demilitarization. (Location 75)


> All of this, as Demmers and Gould (2021) observe, enables greater obfuscation and less accountability for military actors. Highly secretive, these operations rest their legitimacy on claims for the use of ‘precision’ technology. However, as Chamayou (2014: 143) has observed, ‘The fact that your weapon enables you to destroy precisely whomever you wish does not mean that you are more capable of making out who is and who is not a legitimate target’. The language of precision in this context conflates the accuracy with which a weapon strikes a designated target with the vagaries through which US forces identify who and what warrants attack (Suchman, 2020). (Location 107)


> Insecurity is the condition of possibility for militarism on this analysis, kept alive by an imagined world of perfect preparedness against an open horizon of threat. (Location 120)


> Despite the manifest performativity of these discourses of insecurity, the closed world and its theaters of operation rest upon an objectivist onto-epistemology that takes as self-evident the independent existence of a world ‘out there’ (Law, 2004) to which military action is a necessary response. (Location 128)


> where the stimulus was characterized as some aspect of an environment understood as external to the actant, and the response as any observable movement taken to be effected by exposure to the stimulus. (Location 141)


> Acknowledging the network-centric warfighting of the latest revolution in military affairs (Owens et al., 2000), Endsley and her colleagues reassert the relevance of situation awareness, ‘loosely defined as knowing what is going on’, to the goal of information dominance: (Location 206)


> At the same time, Endsley et al. anticipate the current crisis in data processing and analysis and the turn to pattern recognition as a solution. What they characterize as a naturalistic model of decision making ‘specifies a process in which the decision maker’s perceived situation is categorized based on recognized classes of situations for which known courses of action apply (Location 221)

> One year later, in April of 2017, the DoD announced plans for its flagship AI project, the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team (code-named Project Maven) under the leadership of Lt General ‘Jack’ Shanahan. The memo that establishes Project Maven was signed by then Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work. The plan for Maven includes an initial project focused on the task of labeling ‘objects’ (which it soon became clear includes vehicles, buildings, and also persons) in the video generated by US drone surveillance operations, as a first step toward establishing the computational infrastructures needed to automate object detection and classification and to generate, in the words of Robert Work, ‘actionable intelligence and insights at speed’ (Deputy Secretary of Defense, 2017). (Location 253)


> While technologists understand AI as a convenient (and highly salable) shorthand for a suite of statistically based techniques and technologies for automating data analysis, the term as used throughout the report implies something singular and sui generis. (Location 289)


> Any demonstrated risks, limits, or vulnerabilities of existing technologies are treated by the Commission as grounds for further investment: Along with the premise of an unavoidable arms race between the US and China, this proposition takes any question of decisions not to pursue the development of AI technologies off the table (see Suchman, 2021). (Location 291)


> These exercises extend ongoing efforts at data integration between increasingly software-laden bodies, vehicles, and command locations, while continuing to be haunted by the demands and resistances of legacy systems. (Location 354)


> Particularly problematic for weapon systems based on machine learning is the question of the sources for training data, and their associated translatability and transportability. (Location 358)


> … Tsing has used the term ‘conjuring’ to capture the imaginative work that investment companies engage in to entice speculators. ‘In speculative enterprises’, Tsing observes, ‘profit must be imagined before it can be extracted; the possibility of economic performance must be conjured like a spirit to draw an audience of potential investors’ (2001: 159). If financial speculation is based on conjuring utopian futures of profit, the selling of bunkered cloud storage is based on conjuring the spectre of disaster. (Taylor, 2021: 85) (Location 381)


> In the case of so-called irregular warfare, what signals ‘participation in hostilities’ has shifted from an actor’s clothing and other emblematic designations to ‘what the actor does and the kind of relations s/he has with other human beings, the surrounding environment, and what International Humanitarian Law (IHL) defines as legitimate military targets’ (Perugini and Gordon, 2017: 5). (Location 440)


> As the International Committee for the Red Cross notes, the automation of target identification is effectively death and injury based on a generalized target profile, where human life is reduced to sensor data and machine processing (International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC, 2021): 16). And insofar as the military apparatus of distinction is accountable to international law, its fundamental point of reference is the binary civilian/combatant. (Location 443)


> As the category of militant is expanded, the space for being counted as a civilian shrinks (see Wilke, 2014, 2017). (Location 460)


> He observes that absent any systematic process for verifying the identity of those killed, ‘the Obama administration and its Pakistani counterparts have gone out of their way to obscure realities on the ground’ (2015: 12). They are aided in this by media reports that rely on ‘official sources’ (almost always unnamed), which consistently under-report non-combatant deaths and over-estimate the numbers of ‘militants’ killed in a given operation. These numbers, he explains, are then aggregated by certain prominent ‘think tanks’ (rendering them more authoritative) and circulated further through the media.16 The numbers are consequently constructed through what Ahmad (2016: 3) characterizes as ‘rituals of objectivity that mask credulity’, fetishizing statistics without questioning the integrity of the data from which they are compiled. This circuit of reporting effectively contributes, he argues, to serious under-representation of the death wrought by these operations, and to ‘a misleading perception of the war as precise, surgical and discriminating’ (p. 3; see also Suchman, 2020). (Location 478)


> To differentiate signal and noise, filmmaker Steyerl (2019) observes, means not only to recognize patterns but also to create them in the first place (p. 3). (Location 491)


> Building on a growing literature that analyzes the scopic regimes of military visuality (Chamayou, 2014; Gregory, 2011), Wilke demonstrates how intelligence, particularly with respect to the categories of civilian/combatant, is irremediably situated in the political commitments, knowledge systems, affective registers, and temporal contingencies of military operations. (Location 516)


> However much those actions might then affect subsequent events, the circuit of observation and action relies upon an onto-epistemology that positions war fighters as always engaged in objectively necessary interventions into a world separate from and threatening to their own. (Location 532)


> As all understanding is inescapably partial and situated, it is – particularly in the context of military operations – profoundly shaped by longstanding cultural historical predispositions and investments, animated by the exigencies of the moment. (Location 535)


> As Somali-British poet Warsan Shire poignantly remarks of the current crisis of refuges in the Mediterranean, no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land (Shire, 2013). (Location 554)


> The closed world relies, moreover, on forms of systemic ignorance required to maintain the premise that war fighting can be conducted rationally through a seamless web of technologically generated situational awareness.20 (Location 560)


> The through line from the closed world of the Cold War to the current technopolitical imaginary is the figure of objective knowledge that can resolve interpretive flexibility, this time through data analytics at scale. The premise is that the analytic apparatus can transform the contingencies and ambiguities of relations on the ground into noise from which, through statistical techniques operating over large data sets, a stable and unambiguous signal can be abstracted. (Location 562)


> In the current moment increasing datafication, as the infrastructure for situational awareness, produces new needs for ever more complex connectivity and analytical tools, which in turn exacerbate the very complexity that they aspire to tame.21 (Location 569)


> I have suggested that the most powerful alternative to closed-world knowledge making is investigative journalism and other modes of on-the-ground research and reporting.22 (Location 571)


> I treat the term ‘AI’ as a figure to emphasize that more than a specific technology, or even set of technologies, AI has become what anthropologist Lévi-Strauss (1987) first called a ‘floating signifier’, a term that suggests a concrete referent, but works to ‘float’ or even to evade definition in order to maximize its suggestive power. That qualification should be read into my use of the term throughout this article. (Location 607)
