## Highlights

> Two fundamental issues in emotion theory and research concern: (a) the role of emotion in promoting
>  response coherence across different emotion systems; and (b) the role ofawareness ofbodily sensations in the
>  experience ofemotion. The present study poses a question bridging the two domains; namely, whether training
>  in Vipassana meditation or dance, both of which promote attention to certain kinds of bodily sensations, is
>  associated with greater coherence between the subjective and physiological aspects of emotion. We used lag
>  correlations to examine second-by-second coherence between subjective emotional experience and heart
>  period within individuals across four different films. Participants were either: (a) experienced Vipassana
>  meditators (attention to visceral sensations), (b) experienced dancers (attention to somatic sensations), and (c)
>  controls with no meditation or dance experience. Results indicated a linear relationship in coherence, with
>  meditators having highest levels, dancers having intermediary levels, and controls having lowest levels. We
>  conclude that the coherence between subjective and cardiac aspects of emotion is greater in those who have
>  specialized training that promotes greater body awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7cpn5dpr0yhwez0vz6981zr))

> The concepts of response coherence (Darwin, 1872; Ekman,
>  1992; Lazarus, 1991; Levenson, 1994; Scherer, 1984; Tomkins,
>  1962) and awareness of bodily sensations (Damasio, 2000; James,
>  1884; Levenson, 2003a) are central to many emotion theories.
>  Response coherence implies that emotions organize and synchro-
>  nize different response systems (Darwin, 1872; Ekman, 1992;
>  Lazarus, 1991; Levenson, 1994; Tomkins, 1962) such that when
>  we are in the throes ofa strong emotion, our subjective, behavioral,
>  and physiological responses should track each other more closely
>  than when we are at rest. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7cq8wkz749gtq37j8vrvfv8))

> Although many contemporary emotion theories espouse

>  of emotion. The present study poses a question bridging these two
>  domains, asking whether individuals who have specialized training
>  in body awareness will have greater coherence between subjective
>  and physiological aspects of emotion. We reason that if sensations
>  emanating from bodily responses are primary constituents of sub-
>  jective emotional experience, then subjective emotional experience
>  should more closely track and be coherent with physiological
>  responding for those who are more aware oftheir bodily responses. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7cpxcsrem5wemywp5azcx83))

> We (Levenson, 2003b) have likened this coordination to a

>  needed to construct an appropriate emotional response, but also for
>  the precise timing of this delivery, providing sufficient quantities
>  when needed and quickly removing that which is no longer

> The notion that bodily sensations contribute importantly to our
>  subjective emotional experience appears in the literature in a
>  number of forms. James (1884) famously asserted that emotions
>  occur when the perception ofan exciting fact causes a collection of
>  bodily changes and that “our feeling of the same changes as they
>  occur is the emotion” (p. 189). Lakoff (1987) noted the promi-
>  nence of bodily metaphors when we describe the experience of
>  certain emotions (e.g., heat and pressure metaphors when describ-
>  ing anger). Consistent with these views, we (Levenson, 1999)
>  postulated that the “subjective experience of a given emotion
>  derives largely from the sensations that are generated by the
>  activation of the associated response package” (p. 496). Similarly,
>  theories of embodied cognition suggest that there is a reciprocal
>  relationship between bodily activity and the way emotional infor-
>  mation is processed (for a review, see Niedenthal, 2007). These
>  notions are also found in contemporary neuroscience, with
>  Damasio (2000) postulating that one of the main roles of emotion
>  is to bring the autonomic processes of our bodies into awareness,
>  providing “somatic markers” that guide our choices and actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7cqfmvp2x9skafnq7wayap2))

  - heartbeat tracking is hilarious. It's such a blunt proxy. (note also research about how it correlates poorly with other interoception stuff). On this see the authors' note about ecological validity (in next paragraph).

- Note: p.811 -- this is getting at the change in perception vs perception of change thing I think. That is, more training did not mean more emotional reactivity???

  - reminded here of change in perception vs perception of change. Not clear to me if this study handles that kind of nuance. For instance, a meditator might have increased perception of change and therefore is more sensitive to smaller 'increments' in subjective emotional experiences. But perhaps their correlations do handle this.
