# wokeness and myth

_previous note:_ [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]]

Jacobs initially describes Kołakowski's distinction between the [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]. This article is an attempt to make sense of _woke culture_ and how it is impervious to technological -- rational -- manipulation. That is, "the attempt to translate mythical intuitions into 'rationalized structures' will [...] be perceived as a kind of violation."[@jacobs_wokeness_2017 p.36]

Jacobs suggests that from the outside, someone operating in the mythical core will appear to be dealing with contingent, and malleable ideas (that are subject to history, cultural context, etc). But from the inside the person's understanding will be a "nonempirical unconditioned reality"[p.37]; something fixed, or simply the way they are and always will be. 

>Most of the defenders of the historic mission of the university articulate that mission in terms of “critical thinking,” “the free exchange of ideas,” and other slogans that place the institution firmly within the technological core. If the university is inherently an institution of the technological core -- an institution _constituted_ by discursive and analytical reason -- then the answer is no; it cannot incorporate people functioning in the mythical core without becoming a different kind of institution. But can the university be conceptualized otherwise?[p.43]

- similar to my writing in that thing produced?

In short, there is irrevocable friction between people operating from different _cores_ (technological or mythical). Jacobs wonders if universities can ever be places "in which this endless clashing may be accommodated, and the resulting cultural momentum be encouraged, made fruitful?"[p.44]

>But if this conflict is to be fruitful, or even just bearable, it will happen only if we understand the cognitive constraints under which we all labor, and only if we acknowledge the reality of life within the mythical core, with all its experiences of defilement and desecration. Cheap talk about “critical thinking” and “the free exchange of ideas” is clearly no longer adequate to the challenges we face.[p.44]

_thoughts & links:_

- thinking about experience at Somatics conferences where this distinction between mythical and technological seems very apparent (and perhaps even something to be welcomed?)
- useful for #homogenous_body (see [omnifocus project](omnifocus:///task/kZagjFM2OOZ))
- hints at Jonathan Haidt's thinking about two different types of universities: one focused on truth and one focused on changing the world: [theindependentwhig.com/haidt-passages/haidt/haidt-two-incompatible-sacred-values-in-american-universities/](https://theindependentwhig.com/haidt-passages/haidt/haidt-two-incompatible-sacred-values-in-american-universities/)
