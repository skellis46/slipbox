# practice of somatic movement education and therapy

_previous note:_ [[history of somatics]]

---

On the website of the International Somatic Movement Education and Therapy Association describes how the practice of somatic movement education and therapy includes "postural and movement evaluation", "experiential anatomy and imagery", "movement patterning and re-patterning", and "communication and guidance through touch and verbal cues."[@noauthor_scope_2020 n.p.]

The purpose of somatic therapy is to help people to:

>- focus on the body both as an objective physical process and as a subjective process of lived consciousness
>- refine perceptual, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, and interoceptive sensitivity that supports homeostasis, co-regulation, and neuroplasticity
>- recognize habitual patterns of perceptual, postural and movement interaction with the environment
>- improve movement coordination that supports structural, functional and expressive integration
>- experience an embodied sense of vitality and create both meaning for and enjoyment of life


_questions & thoughts:_

- This is an 'edge-case' for me really. I've included it as a note because it's really a primary source -- an organisation busy with the business of somatic practices. 
- there are lots of big words in the ways in which somatics help people
- do I doubt that it does these things? What are my doubts based on? 
- perhaps the critical question is about mechanisms for these changes. That is, **how** does somatic movement education function and what evidence is there for this? 
- there is certainly a lack of precision in the language, as if there is a sense of obfuscation
