# stone age mind in a space age world
> Well, in my lifetime there was only the analog world and now at a certain point, in the late ’90s I think, you know, really for most of us, it became digital with the World Wide Web and, you know, all of that. So this is a gigantic experiment. It’s never happened before on the planet. Everybody that’s born more recently they’ve only experienced the digital world … not the analog world, as least talking about our country. So we do, I agree with you. I think we need to let that be in some sense an object of attention. We need to hold that in awareness and see how much the technology is improving our lives versus how much the technology is turning us into slaves of the technology, which it is certainly doing in a certain way. Because the technology is seductive. I don’t know if you’ve noticed that, but it can be very seductive. And addictive. And after a while, between BlackBerrys and pagers and laptops and this and that, first of all, just let’s consider what we used to quaintly call the “workweek.”
> There’s no end to the workweek.
> There’s no beginning to it. There’s no end to the workday or beginning of the workday. So we can work 24/7 everywhere. IBM brags about this in their advertisements. When IBM goes digital, the workplace is everywhere. Yeah. Great. Except that life isn’t merely working.
> And the Stone Age mind in a Space Age world. So we’re in transition here, and I’m not knocking the technology.
> I’m not saying sort of like we should go back — I’m not taking a Luddite position on this. I think that technology is incredibly beautiful, and it’s going to get more and more and more powerful and more and more beautiful. But there are issues associated with it that have to do with — the technology is in some sense getting more sophisticated than our understanding of ourselves as human beings …
> Or, you know, nanotechnology and all of that kind of stuff and then robotics. You know, we’re moving towards a very strange world in some ways, at least so far that we don’t know what it’s going to be. But one piece of it hasn’t developed yet and that is our intimacy, our deep understanding of what it means to be human. We’re still in our infancy as a human species. And before we start to talk about wet/dry interfaces where you start putting chips inside of the skull, for instance, to regulate certain things or upgrade our memory or whatever it is that might seem so attractive, that we really in the next few generations need to reclaim the full dimensionality of our humanity. My point is that maybe the technology will be a kind of mirror in which we can look and remind ourselves that there are aspects of being human and being analog that we don’t want to give up to machines when they get smart enough to maybe pretend that they have feelings or look like they have feelings.
