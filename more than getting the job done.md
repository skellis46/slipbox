# more than getting the job done

The American tennis player Jimmy Connors was in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s. He was known as being brash – a bit of a scrapper – and he introduced fist-pumping into tennis long before fist-pumping was the go-to gesture for all athletes.

I recently happened across this gem [courtesy of the design blogger Tina Roth Eisenberg, also known as Swissmiss](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2021/08/link-pack-96.html) of Connors from 1996 when he was playing on the _senior_ tour as an obviously elderly 44 year old.

In the clip, Connors has a problem – a problem he will have experienced many thousands of times in his career. His solution to the problem is not ideal (ie with an unlikely chance of success) but it does represent one of several options available to him, even if it is not using the racket according to the instructions on the packet.[*]

I was reminded of the well-known (and brief) essay ...


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question.

Racket as alternate device. Noe.

See [[art is bad design on purpose#^ad29b3]] -- kind of the point.
And also [[literature notes/Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature]] -- summary of his book.


      
* Apparently his was a legal _shot_ in those days, as long as the player catches the racket afterwards. At same stage since 1996 the rules were changed such that a player must have control of the racket. Booo tennis.
