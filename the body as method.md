# the body as method

_previous note:_ [[history of somatics]]

---

In his introduction to the edited volume _Modes of Knowing: Resources from the Baroque_, the sociologist John Law lists some areas that social science's _modes of knowing_ have the most difficulty with:

>BODIES. The idea that the body might be part of method is difficult. ... But despite the exceptions, social science m odes of knowing depend on but also tend to other the methodologically salient body.[@law_modes_2016-1 p.21]


_questions & thoughts:_

- I'm taking this out of context (haven't read the book) so need to tread carefully
- [ ] I've only touched on this book (Law 2016) and need to scan to determine how much further to go with it
- it's not clear the relationship bewteen "modes of knowing" that social sciences have difficult with, and something that is "part of method". There's a jump there.

- [[first-person experience]]
- [[senses united by action]]
- [[somatics, action and technology]]
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
