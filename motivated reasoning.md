# motivated reasoning

_previous note:_ [[myside bias]]

---

_The Story of Us_ is a series of chapters or blog posts that delve into the sociology and psychology of human societies. One of the central themes of the series is the tension between our primitive minds (equivalent to our [primal or reptilian brain](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/our-three-brains-the-reptilian-brain)) and our higher minds. One of the distinctions between these two minds is that our higher minds value truth, and our primitive minds value confirmation (of existing beliefs). 

In Chapter 7 -- called [The Thinking Ladder](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html) -- Urban builds on a distinction between _what_ we think and _how_ we think. On the _how we think_ axis, Urban creates four levels or rungs: 

1. Thinking Like a Scientist
2. Thinking Like a Sports Fan
3. Thinking Like an Attorney
4. Thinking Like a Zealot

In the 2nd to top rung -- Thinking Like a Sports Fan -- Urban introduces the concept of motivated reasoning, and "Weird things happen to your thinking when the pure drive for truth is infected by some ulterior motive."[@urban_thinking_2019 Chapter 7, The Thinking Ladder, n.p.]

Urban cites the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt who describes motivated skeptcism like this:

>We don’t look out at the world and say, “Where’s the weight of the evidence?” We start with an original supposition and we say, “Can I believe it?” If I want to believe something, I ask: Can I believe it? Can I find the justification? But if I don’t want to believe it, I say: Must I believe it? Am I forced to believe it? Or can I escape?[Haidt, in @urban_thinking_2019 Chapter 7, The Thinking Ladder, n.p.]

In the classic study, subjects are shown some medical research that shows that caffeine consumption is linked to breast cancer. The people who find the most flaws in the research are coffee drinkers. They are motivated to doubt the findings:

>Reasoning While Motivated caused the exact people who were most upset about the study’s results to reason differently, and less accurately, than the rest of the participants—because it literally changes what goes on in our brain. An MIT study used actual fMRI data to see what was going on with motivated reasoning, and they found that “motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached.”[^neural][@urban_thinking_2019 Chapter 7, The Thinking Ladder, n.p.]

The situation gets worse according to Urban when we treat our existing beliefs like lawyers treat their clients:

>Working for your beliefs means you’re not reasoning objectively and you’re not even Reasoning While Motivated—it’s more serious than that. You’re Reasoning While Obligated.[@urban_thinking_2019 Chapter 7, The Thinking Ladder, n.p.]
