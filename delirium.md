# delirium

_previous note:_ [[Seth - Being You]]

> Delirium – a word surfacing from the depths of the sixteenth century – comes from the Latin delirare, to deviate, to be deranged. The dictionary calls it ‘an acutely disturbed state of mind characterised by restlessness, illusions, and incoherence’. [@seth-2021-being Loc 2374]

> Up to a third of elderly patients entering acute care develop hospital-induced delirium, and the proportion is even higher for those having surgery. [@seth-2021-being Loc 2395]
