# habeus corpus

_previous note:_ [[ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)]]

The term literally means 'that you have the body'. 

> it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be brought before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond their authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on their behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ ofÂ _habeas corpus_.
