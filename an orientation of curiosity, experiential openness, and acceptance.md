# an orientation of curiosity, experiential openness, and acceptance

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

> One of the most commonly cited definitions in the psychological literature has been provided by Kabat-Zinn ([1994](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-018-0995-z#ref-CR34)): “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally” (p. 4). More detail and a wider range of aspects has been given by Bishop et al. ([2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-018-0995-z#ref-CR7)), who “see mindfulness as a process of regulating attention in order to bring a quality of nonelaborative awareness to current experience and a quality of relating to one’s experience within an orientation of curiosity, experiential openness, and acceptance. We further see mindfulness as a process of gaining *insight* into the nature of one’s mind and the adoption of a de-centered perspective…on thoughts and feelings so that they can be experienced in terms of their subjectivity (versus their necessary validity) and transient nature (versus their permanence)” (p.234). [@krageloh-2019-phenomenological p.15]

- I have copy of Bishop et al 2004
- really like this definition by Bishop et al. The one by Kabat-Zinn is the most commonly used (to the extent that it would be weird not to include it if discussing mindfulness)
- ought to look into that concept of nonelaborative awareness
- [[losing oneself]]
