# device paradigm and focal things

Albert Borgmann is an American scholar working in the philosophy of technology. His book _Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life_ (1984) builds on Heidegger's concept of enframing (Gestell) and introduces two key terms: the _device paradigm_, and _focal things_. 

The device paradigm is a way of understanding technology as a device or series of devices that deliver commodities, and that the mechanisms for this delivery are hidden. Technology becomes synonymous with devices and not the hidden mechanisms. 

A focal thing is intimately connected to practice and is something that delivers more than one commodity. For example, a hearth is for more than just warmth: it is communal, social, and even a place for cooking and sharing food. 

>A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.

_questions & thoughts:_

- the word "preserved" really sticks out here for me. Borgmann also talks about how the device paradigm obscures the "destructive tendencies" of technological devices. Preservation's other is loss.
- there's work here for me to do about understanding the role of somatic practices in and beyond dance. And what if I were to understand somatic practices as a technology akin to a device paradigm?
- is this process of mechanisms becoming hidden inevitable? Is it worth reversing or resisting? 
- what are the effects of the device paradigm? That is, how are we changed by it?

- [[without symbolic mediation]]
- [[gestell and enframing]]
- [[instrumental extrinsic value definition]]
- scan Borgmann's Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life (1984) to decide if warrants detailed reading: [borgmann-1984-technology.pdf](hook://file/nqMct1Yyk?p=c2tlbGxpcy9Eb3dubG9hZHM=&n=borgmann-1984-technology.pdf)
