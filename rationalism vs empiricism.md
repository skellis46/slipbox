# rationalism vs empiricism

_previous note:_ [[empirical research]]

---

The contrast between rationalism and empiricism is based on the extent to which we are dependent on our senses to gain knowledge:

>Rationalists claim that there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience. Empiricists claim that sense experience is the ultimate source of all our concepts and knowledge.[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

For rationalists, _reason_ is a source of concepts and knowledge.

As an aside, Markie writes a concise list of the three defining questions of epistemology:[@markie_rationalism_2017 n.p.]

1. What is the nature of propositional knowledge, knowledge that a particular proposition about the world is true?

>To know a proposition, we must believe it and it must be true, but something more is required, something that distinguishes knowledge from a lucky guess. Let’s call this additional element ‘warrant’. A good deal of philosophical work has been invested in trying to determine the nature of warrant.

2. How can we gain knowledge?

>We can form true beliefs just by making lucky guesses. How to gain warranted beliefs is less clear. Moreover, to know the world, we must think about it, and it is unclear how we gain the concepts we use in thought or what assurance, if any, we have that the ways in which we divide up the world using our concepts correspond to divisions that actually exist.

3. What are the limits of our knowledge?

>Some aspects of the world may be within the limits of our thought but beyond the limits of our knowledge; faced with competing descriptions of them, we cannot know which description is true. Some aspects of the world may even be beyond the limits of our thought, so that we cannot form intelligible descriptions of them, let alone know that a particular description is true.

_questions & thoughts:_

- what is not "sense experience"? That is, what kinds of activities or phenomena do not require "sense experiences"?

_consider:_

- #finger-pointing-moon -- concerned with question 3, and to a certain extent an empirical approach to question 2. The concept of _warrant_ seems useful in how to understand its nature in something like practice-research.
