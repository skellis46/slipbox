# direct experience through the senses

_previous note:_ [[senses united by action]]

---

In their book _Mindfulness_, Clinical Psychologist Mark Williams and meditation teacher Danny Penman describe the way the mind can not only think, but can also be aware that it is thinking. They write that we humans are also able to experience things directly through our senses without needing language "to stand as an intermediary between us and the world".[@williams_mindfulness_2012 Chapter 1]

_questions & thoughts:_

- my thought here is about reoccurring and tentative link between direct experience and intrinsic value. That direct experiences perhaps have a different relationship to value. It's tentative at best. Does this relate to [[device paradigm and focal things]] and [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]?
- what is the role of thinking in somatic practices? See for instance [[somatic feedback interrupts habits]]
--- 

_consider:_ 

- [[intrinsic value definition]]
- [[feelings in conversations]]
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
- [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing]] and also [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time#^1225d0]]
