# touching the earth

_previous note:_ [[the earth's critical zone]]

> We touch the Earth with our forehead, our two legs, and our two hands, so that our mind and body form a perfect whole, allowing us to transcend our small self. We surrender our pride, notions, fears, resentments, and even our hopes, and enter the world of "things as they are."[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.143]

> The closer you can lie against the Earth, melting into the Earth, the better. You become nothing in order to become everything.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.145]

> With undivided heart
> to the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha
> that are in the Ten Directions
> and also in myself,
> that are in all Dharma realms
> transcending past, present, and future,
> touching the Earth and surrendering.
> I go for refuge with my whole body and mind.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.145] 

-- poem by Thich Naht Hahn. "The Blooming of a Lotus"

> The Second Prostration is represented by a horizontal line, the here and the now. When we touch the Earth in that position, we touch all living beings who are with us in this moment. We know that we are part of life, that life is seamless.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.174]

- [[footfall]] - thinking about animating a horizontal line as measure of 'time' in the film; notion of surrender is so compelling; transcending our small self
