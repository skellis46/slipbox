# six views of embodied cognition

> Proponents of embodied cognition take as their theoretical starting point not a mind working on abstract problems, but a body that requires a mind to make it function.[@wilson-2002-six, p.625] 

Margaret Wilson is a psychologist. She describes six views of embodied cognition as:

1. cognition is situated (partially true)
2. cognition is time-pressured (partially true)
3. we off-load cognitive work onto the environment (partially true)
4. the environment is part of the cognitive system (deeply problematic)
5. cognition is for action (partially true)
6. off-line cognition is body based (least attention but best documented and most powerful)

Her summaries of these on p.626 are concise and clear. She states that in the literature on embodied cognition these six views are often bundled together. Wilson's aim in this article is to "take a more careful look at each of these claims on its own merits."[@wilson-2002-six p.626]

> Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.[@wilson-2002-six p.625]

Various early sources for thinking re embodied cognition: William James (perception), Piaget (emergence of cognitive abilities), J.J. Gibson (ecological psychology and affordances), Lakoff and Johnson (concepts based on action/movement-based metaphors) and AI and robotics. 

Note how cognition is situated seems to ally with McCallum's [[situated and embodied cognition]]. Lack of precision (not in this article but in the literature in general on embodied cognition) is so frustrating, and how also does Wilson's analysis deal with [[4e cognition]]? Are those 4 Es four of these six? 

## Situated cognition

>... while a cognitive process is being carried out, perceptual information continues to come in that affects processing, and motor activity is executed that affects the environment in task-relevant ways.[@wilson-2002-six p.626]

e.g. driving, holding a conversation.

Doesn't account for human capacity for off-line cognition "in the absence of task-relevant input and output" (p.626). e.g. planning, day-dreaming. Fascinating the use of off-line cognition. 

> our ability to form mental representations about things that are remote in time and space, which is arguably the sine qua non of human thought, in principle cannot yield to a situated cognition analysis. [p.626]

This idea of being remote in time and space is what is meant by _off-line_.

## Cognition is time pressured

> The observation that situated cognition takes place “in real time” is, at bottom, an observation that situated cognition must cope with time pressure.[@wilson-2002-six p.627]

> More sophisticated forms of real-time situated cognition can be seen in any activity that involves continuous updating of plans in response to rapidly changing conditions. Such changing conditions often involve the activity of another human or animal that must be reckoned with. Examples include playing a sport, driving in traffic, and roughhousing with a dog. As interesting as the principles governing these cases may be in their own right, though, the argument that they can be scaled up to provide the governing principles of human cognition in general appears to be un-persuasive.[@wilson-2002-six p.628]

Improvisation (especially contact improvisation?) seems to be a pretty useful example. Wilson makes the case that time pressure is not a governing principle of human cognition. Many tasks are not time-pressured even though they might be performed in a hurry. Notes also how much humans fail under time-pressure (we don't cope with the "representational bottleneck" (p.628)).

> One reason that time pressure is thought to matter is that it creates what has been called a “representational bottleneck.” [p.628] 

## We Off-Load Cognitive Work Onto the Environment

> to reduce the cognitive workload by making use of the environment itself in strategic ways—leaving information out there in the world to be accessed as needed, rather than taking time to fully encode it; and using epistemic actions (Kirsh & Maglio, 1994) to alter the environment in order to reduce the cognitive work remaining to be done.[@wilson-2002-six p.628]

makes distinction between off-loading to avoid memorising (e.g. reference books, calendars, notes) and off-loading to avoid "encoding or holding active in short-term memory what is present in the immediate environment" (pp.628-629). Wilson says it is the latter that is the usual subject of literature on off-loading. She describes these as situated examples of off-loading. Curiously, off-loading as archive (memorising) does not "seem to challenge or shed light on existing theories of cognition" (p.629)

Examples of off-loading work onto environment include: "giving directions for how to get somewhere by first turning one’s self and one’s listener in the appropriate direction" [p.629], but also non-spatial things like: counting on fingers, doing maths with pencil and paper, drawing venn diagrams. Many are a combination of situated and spatial "in the sense that they involve the manipulation of spatial relationships among elements in the environment" [p.629]. 

> The advantage is that by doing actual, physical manipulation, rather than computing a solution in our heads, we save cognitive work. However, unlike the previous examples, there is also a sense in which these activities (counting fingers, etc) are not situated. They are performed in the service of cognitive activity about something else, something not present in the immediate environment.[@wilson-2002-six p.629]

She described symbolic off-loading as being where the "cognitive system is exploiting external resources to achieve a solution or a piece of knowledge whose actual application will occur at some later time and place, if at all."[@wilson-2002-six p.629]

This is when the purpose of the activity is uncoupled from the situation. e.g. mathematics. But also states that the activity doesn't have to be purposeful or even formalized; e.g. gesturing while talking. 

> It has been found that gesturing is not epiphenomenal, nor even strictly communicative, but seems to serve a cognitive function for the speaker, helping to grease the wheels of the thought process that the speaker is trying to express.[p.729]

## The Environment Is Part of the Cognitive System

Describes the claim as follows:

> The forces that drive cognitive activity do not reside solely inside the head of the individual, but instead are distributed across the individual and the situation as they interact. Therefore, to understand cognition we must study the situation and the situated cognizer together as a single, unified system.[@wilson-2002-six p.630]

Then mounts theoretical argument about the nature of systems and why science's goal is not to explain causality but about "understanding fundamental principles of organization and function". [p.630]

> Distributed causality, then, is not sufficient to drive an argument for distributed cognition.[p.630]

In describing the nature of a system Wilson writes "The issue, for any given scientific enterprise, is how best to carve nature at its joints." [p.630] -- gently reminded here of [[the Dao of butchering cows]], except it seems like the opposite. I wasn't sure about her argument re systems. It was clear but just wasn't sure what it meant in practice for cognition research. 

## Cognition Is for Action

Wilson calls for a more balanced perspective by questioning how far the view of perception, memory and cognition can go (in relation to action). Her stance is: 

> The answer being critiqued here is that the connections to action are quite direct: Individual percepts, concepts, and memories are “for” (or are based on) particular action patterns. The evidence discussed above, though, suggests that this is unlikely to hold true across the board. An alternative view is that cognition often subserves action via a more indirect, flexible, and sophisticated strategy, in which information about the nature of the external world is stored for future use without strong commitments on what that future use might be.[p.632]

> A creature that encodes the world using more or less veridical mental models has an enormous advantage in problem-solving flexibility over a creature that encodes purely in terms of presently foreseeable activities.[p.632]

## Off-Line Cognition Is Body Based

> Mental structures that originally evolved for perception or action appear to be co-opted and run “off-line,” decoupled from the physical inputs and outputs that were their original purpose, to assist in thinking and knowing.[p.633]

> Although this off-line aspect of embodied cognition has generated less attention than situated cognition, evidence in its favor has been mounting quietly for many years. Sensorimotor simulations of external situations are in fact widely implicated in human cognition.[p.633]

### Mental imagery

> Imagery, including not only the well-studied case of visual imagery but also those of auditory imagery (Reisberg, 1992) and kinesthetic imagery (Parsons et al., 1995), is an obvious example of mentally simulating external events.[p.633]

### Working memory

> simulating physical events through the off-line use of sensorimotor resources is short-term memory[p.633]

> instead of off-loading all the way out into the environment, working memory off-loads information onto perceptual and motor control systems in the brain.[p.633]

### Episodic memory

> most obvious in the case of episodic memory. Whether or not one posits a separate episodic memory system, episodic memories are a class of memories defined by their content—they consist of records of spatiotemporally localized events, as experienced by the rememberer.[p.633]

### Implicit memory

> Implicit memory is the means by which we learn skills, automatizing what was formerly effortful. Viewed in this light, implicit memory can be seen as a way of taking off line some of the problems that confront the situated cognizer.[p.633] 

### Reasoning and problem-solving

> There is considerable evidence that reasoning and problem-solving make heavy use of sensorimotor simulation. Mental models, particularly spatial ones, generally improve problem-solving relative to abstract approaches.[p.634] 

- gives example of Monk walking up and down hill. 

> Collectively, they [categories above] suggest that there are a wide variety of ways in which sensory and motoric resources may be used for off-line cognitive activity. In accord with this, there are also a number of current areas of research exploring further ways in which off-line cognition may be embodied.[p.634]

Very curious her use of word embodied here. Kind of implies to be 'held' by some part of the body (e.g. sensorimotor simulation, automation). I think scientists have a very different concept of what off-line is, and what 'the body' might be. It's more like she is dealing with a very very small components of the body. I wonder where that line between on-line and offline is? 

> With such a range of arenas where mental simulation of external events may play a role, it appears that off-line embodied cognition is a widespread phenomenon in the human mind. The time may have come when we must consider these not as isolated pieces of theoretical advancement, but as reflecting a very general underlying principle of cognition.[p.635]
