# six views of embodied cognition

Margaret Wilson is a psychologist. She describes six views of embodied cognition as:

1. cognition is situated (partially true)
2. cognition is time-pressured (partially true)
3. we off-load cognitive work onto the environment (partially true)
4. the environment is part of the cognitive system (deeply problematic)
5. cognition is for action (partially true)
6. off- line cognition is body based (least attention but best documented and most powerful)

> Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.[@wilson-2002-six p.625]
