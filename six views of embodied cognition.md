# six views of embodied cognition

> Proponents of embodied cognition take as their theoretical starting point not a mind working on abstract problems, but a body that requires a mind to make it function.[@wilson-2002-six, p.625] 

Margaret Wilson is a psychologist. She describes six views of embodied cognition as:

1. cognition is situated (partially true)
2. cognition is time-pressured (partially true)
3. we off-load cognitive work onto the environment (partially true)
4. the environment is part of the cognitive system (deeply problematic)
5. cognition is for action (partially true)
6. off-line cognition is body based (least attention but best documented and most powerful)

> Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.[@wilson-2002-six p.625]

Various early sources for thinking re embodied cognition: William James (perception), Piaget (emergence of cognitive abilities), J.J. Gibson (ecological psychology and affordances), Lakoff and Johnson (concepts based on action/movement-based metaphors) and AI and robotics. 

Note how cognition is situated seems to ally with McCallum's [[situated and embodied cognition]]. Lack of precision is so frustrating, and how also does Wilson's analysis deal with [[4e cognition]]
