# an artist confronts their experiential world by means of a craft

_previous note:_ [[the Dao of butchering cows]]

Marjatta Saarnivaara uses the word _artist_, based on Juha Varto's work, as someone who "confronts her experiential world by means of a craft and without exerting any conscious conceptual influence and who draws on it to create something new."[@saarnivaara-2003-art p.582]

She then writes: "Thus, anyone can be an artist."(p.582)
 
I assume the "it" refers to the experiential world, but I don't really understand what she means by not "exerting any conscious conceptual influence."

_thoughts & links:_

- what grabs me here is the statement of "by means of a craft" to create "something new". It touches on qualities of care, judgement and dexterity that Ingold describes: [[the skilled practitioner is responsive]]
