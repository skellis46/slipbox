# constructivist epistemology

_previous note:_ [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]]

---

This is the idea that we construct knowledge; that we use mental constructions to make sense of observable phenomena. Constructivism does not suggest there isn't an observable world, only that our knowledge of the world is constructed.

Jean Piaget first used the term _constructivist epistemology_ in 1967. 

In psychology, "constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding."[Juan Balbi (2008) in @noauthor_constructivism_2020 n.p.]

- see note in [[epistemic rationality]] in which I mention a continuum in #practice-research regarding degrees of falsifiability
