# predictive processing vs controlled hallucination

_previous note:_ [[Bayes and abductive reasoning]]

> What Bayes’ theorem doesn’t do is specify how, in terms of neural mechanisms, the brain accomplishes these feats of best guessing. Answering this question returns us to the controlled hallucination theory of perception, and to the central claim that conscious contents are not merely shaped by perceptual predictions – they are these predictions. [@seth-2021-being Loc 1735]

> The controlled hallucination view shares many features with other ‘predictive’ theories of perception and brain function, most prominently predictive processing. There is, however, an important difference of emphasis. Predictive processing is a theory about the 107mechanisms by which brains accomplish perception (and cognition, and action). The controlled hallucination view, by contrast, is about how brain mechanisms explain phenomenological properties of conscious perception. In other words, predictive processing is a theory about how brains work, whereas the controlled hallucination view takes this theory and develops it to account for the nature of conscious experiences. Importantly, both rest on the bedrock process of prediction error minimisation. (Location 1745)

> What this means, in practice, is that the brain continually adjusts the influence of sensory signals 109on perceptual inference. It does this by transiently altering their estimated precision. This is what is meant by the term ‘precision weighting’. Down-weighting estimated precision means that sensory signals have less influence on updating best guesses, while up-weighting means the opposite: a stronger influence of sensory signals on perceptual inference. In this way, precision weighting plays an essential role in choreographing the delicate dance between predictions and prediction errors needed to reach a perceptual best guess. (Location 1777)


> Although this sounds complicated, we are all intimately familiar with the role of precision weighting in perception. Increasing the estimated precision of sensory signals is nothing other than ‘paying attention’. When you pay attention to something – for example, really trying to see whether a gorilla is out there in the distance – your brain is increasing the precision weighting on the corresponding sensory signals, which is equivalent to increasing their estimated reliability, or turning up their ‘gain’. Thinking about attention this way can explain why sometimes we don’t see things, even if they are in plain view, and even if we are looking right at them. (Location 1782)
