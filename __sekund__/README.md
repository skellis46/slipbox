**Please, do not touch documents in this folder!**

This folder is used as a local cache for all notes that people share with you.

If you're curious, the general structure for files inside is as follows:

- children of the root folder are all user identifiers. Those are "technical identifiers" which identify a particular user / email address __inside a given team__, which means that if you have a contact that shares files with you from different teams, you will find them in as many subfolders;
- note dependencies (images, videos, other notes) are all stored in that same subfolder;
- notes are automatically stored here, which may, in time, bloat your vault. Sekund will soon offer a mechanism for cleaning those files;
- if you click on a note from Sekund panes, it will be automatically downloaded again, along with its dependencies, so __refrain from editing those files__ as you will almost surely lose your changes;
- Although you cannot edit those notes, you can link to them just as any normal note;
