# Chat Space 1

Let's use this note, or rather its comments, as a chat space for the group. Round one.

(We can add chat rounds or spaces whenever the comment stream gets too long, or whenever we want a chat on a different topic or session. Maybe we can even find a way to copy in a chat history to the note, so we can save to a nicer format. And edit it and keep it for posterity.)

So... -> look on over to the comments on this note for chat space.

#Simon wrote (Tracy scribed): Just adding a comment here directly on the note. I guess I'd prefer not to make notes that are 'special' to the book club -- including tags, headers, etc. That is, ideally (for me) the shared book club space would become an extension or addition to my own vault. My thought here is future-proofing my own slipbox. (added by Tracy -- see comments)

#Tracy  -- this is an important issue. Chris, for example, goes to elaborate lengths to keep outside matter available in/to his One Vault, and yet manages to keep it standalone and to keep its integrity. I am currently not working in my vault, but a test vault.
