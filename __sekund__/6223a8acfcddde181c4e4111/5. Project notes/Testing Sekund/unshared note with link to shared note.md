Here I am initially creating a note, and inserting a link to a note shared in sekund by Tracy. Before I share this note, I will see if the link works and calls up Tracy's note. 

[[Tracy's test note]]

The link worked and took me to Tracy's test note. My unshared note showed up as a backlink in the backlinks pane of Tracy's test note -- as part of my vault.
