#shared #EMBC

Here's a note created in my own vault, which I'll upload into Sekund to share with the group.

Trying again:

[[EM Book Club]]

As I was saying... before I got rather rudely wiped out by Sekund (my own fault because I didn't hit "Update"! -- see comment thread on this note, as I was troubleshooting)... there's nothing obvious in my note that says it's shared. (And my notes don't appear in the Sekund folder; that's only for the notes of other folks.) So I'm going to tag this note as shared, and as part of the EMBC.

Since who knows what I might want to share from my vault, I don't think I'll keep a separate folder per se for shared notes -- although I may for *some* shared notes that pertain directly to the EM Book Club project. Hmm.

It might still be handy to continue with our date and hashtag convention from the Smart Notes vault. I'm going to implement that, even make a template for it.

### Simon and Tracy's experiment
Testing the local linked note and another user creating a new note.
[[Linked note not shared]] (<- This note is local to Tracy only. What happens when Simon clicks on this "dead" link, creates his own note, then shares it?)


**NOTE:
This is the actual text  of Tracy's test note copied and renamed. Part I was retitling a local copy of a dead link. The original  is [[Tracy's test note|here]]**
