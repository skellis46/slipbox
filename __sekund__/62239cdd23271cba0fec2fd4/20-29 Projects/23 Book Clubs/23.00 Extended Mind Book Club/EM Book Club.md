# EM Book Club

Continuing to meet on Saturdays.

## Immediate Goals

- [ ] Getting the books.
	- [[annie murphy paul and ezra klein - extended mind]]

## Collecting What We've Learned so Far

- only owners can add permanent edits to their own notes.
	- Any stranger's edits will get wiped out by Sekund. It does say this in the intro manual, but a few of us (myself included) aren't really faithful manual readers.
	- This means we don't have any community edited notes, like the Community Forum file in the previous vault.
- Since Sekund is importing the other's note directly into your vault, in the special protected sekund folder, the other tags, aliases, etc are incorporated into the metadata of your own vault.

Some questions:

- Is the "commenting on other's notes" feature, plus keeping our notes in our "main" vaults more useful than the collaboratively editing in the non-main community vault feature?
