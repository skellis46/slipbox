# language and the DMN

_previous note:_ [[DMN]]

> ... many brain regions that process language also control the insides of your body: The brain regions that scientists call the “language network” overlap to a large extent with a network called the “default mode network,” particularly on the left side of the brain. The default mode network is part of a larger system that controls the internal systems of your body, including your autonomic nervous system (which controls your cardiovascular system, respiratory system, and other organ systems), immune system, and endocrine system (which controls hormones and metabolism).
