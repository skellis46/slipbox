# we are the weather

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> We make the weather meaningful in the vocabularies we have for it, in the dances that embody its elemental forces and in how we relate to it as a constant presence that interpenetrates our moods, atmospheres and soma. At the same time, and more problematically inside a time of climate emergency, we are the weather.[@brown-2020-hau p.69]


_thoughts & links:_

- beautiful shift between _make_ and _are_ not so different from I have a body and I am a body in [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
- also re non-attachment to the weather as simple example of mindfulness training; see [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]
- interpenetration and air in [[the circulation of oxygen]] 
- [[footfall]]
