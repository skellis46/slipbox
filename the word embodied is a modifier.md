# the word embodied is a modifier

_previous note:_ [[there is no natural soma]]

---

In dance scholarship we seem to use the verb _to embody_ rather loosely and confusingly. Of the various definitions in the OED -- and putting aside some of the military-oriented etymologies as in "the number of embodied troops" from 1803 -- the closest to our common use seems to be "to put into a body" or "invest or clothe (a spirit) with a body".[@noauthor_embody_2019] A soul or spirit is embodied when it has a body or is "invested with a body."[@noauthor_embodied_2019] Perhaps this suggests a process of holding or containing in the body something that is not normally thought of as being of the body. And so when we (dance scholars) use the phrase "embodied knowledge" perhaps we are simply drawing attention to a form of understanding that is distinct from common understandings of knowledge, and that is _held_ in the body. The same with embodied intelligence, and even embodied awareness. 

But what about _embodied actions_ or _embodied movements_ or even _embodied dance_? These are all terms common in dance practice and scholarship. Actions, movements and dance are concepts that are already primarily corporeal, at least in their common usage. It's as if in these examples the word _embodied_ acts as an adjectival modifier to help make the nouns more specific, not unlike _fast_ or _hot_ or _sexy_. As in fast actions, hot movements and sexy dance. But with _embodied_ as a modifier of human action this does not seem quite right. I suspect that when we describe an action as _embodied_ we are ascribing some quality of attention or awareness to that action. That such embodied actions are not trivially placed on the outside of the body, but rather invested deeply within the body. The question of how it is that we might recognise embodied actions over what I'll call _disembodied actions_ is an entirely different problem.

_thoughts & links:_

- do animals perform embodied actions? (my guess is that we'd assume not. That being embodied requires a kind of consciousness or awareness not available to animals. But I'm not so sure.) This question occurred to me after podcast episode with Jonathan Burrows this morning on topic of embodiment and then after reading this from Ingold[@ingold_transmission_2001 p.133]

>In his study of the computational tasks involved in maritime navigation, Edwin Hutchins observes that 'humans create their cognitive powers by creating the environments in which they exercise these powers' (1996: 169). This, for him, is the process of culture, though one could just as well call it history. But is there anything specifically human about this process? Hutchins compares the human navigator to the ant, which owes its apparently innate ability to locate food sources with uncanny accuracy to the trails left in the environment by countless predecessors. Wipe out the trails, and the ant is lost. So, indeed, would humans be, without culture or history. Hutchins's conclusion is that the capacities of the ant, too, are constituted within a historical process of culture.

- my thinking above is distinct from the term embodied cognition -- see [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]] -- which is, more or less, an attempt to extend our understanding of cognition beyond the brain; to literally 'bring the body' into that understanding.
