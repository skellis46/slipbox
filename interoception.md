# interoception

_previous note:_ [[practice of somatic movement education and therapy]]

Mehling writes how interoception can be narrowly and broadly defined. Narrowly, it can be defined as "the perception of physical sensations from inside the body and includes sensations related to internal organ function, such as heartbeat, respiration, satiety, and autonomic nervous sys- tem activity related to emotions"[@mehling-2020-if p.255]. 

Broadly, Mehling defines it as "any perception that originates inside the body."[@mehling-2020-if p.255]

He includes links to primary research on interoception (narrowly and broadly defined) and notes how research on interoception in the last decade has exploded.

Note also the distinction between interoceptive accuracy (sensitivity) and awareness (sensibility).[@mehling-2020-if p.255]

*What follows is material from the wikipedia page (note obvious and important distinction between conscious and unconscious sense):*

Interoception is the conscious or unconscious sense of the internal state of the body. It relates to physiological tissues that send information to the central nervous system about the state of the body. These tissues or pathways are: 

1. the laminaI spinothalamic pathway
2. the classical viscerosensory pathway
3. the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve
4. chemosensory pathways in the blood
5. somatosensory pathways from the skin

>The somatosensory pathway relays information about [[proprioception]] and discriminative touch to the brain through different receptors in the skin.[@noauthor_interoception_2020 n.p.]

_questions & thoughts:_

- when it coems to the skin in 5. the line between exteroception and interoception is not so clear to me.

_consider:_

- [[direct experience through the senses]]
- [[empirical research]]
