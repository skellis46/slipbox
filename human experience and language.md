# human experience and language

_previous note:_      

---

In _Life is a Miracle_ (2001), the poet and writer Wendell Berry discusses many diverse ideas. But one thing he seems to be fascinated by -- as am I -- is the limits of language:

>In speaking of the reductionism of modern science, we should not forget that the primary reductionism is in the assumption that human experience or human meaning can be adequately represented in any human language. This assumption is false.

I'm not sure that it's solely "modern science" that is responsible for this reductionism. Furthermore, what if _adequate_ is enough? That we must continue to recognise that it is only ever the finger pointing at the moon? 

_questions & thoughts:_

- I like how he writes "any human language" (perhaps implying some languages might be better at it than others?)
- the obvious question for exploration is about the possibilities and limits of other forms (in part this would explain his practice as a poet) -- including video essays, etc

--- 

_consider:_ 

- anything to do with practice-research and epistemology
- [body of the film](x-devonthink-item://1FCD4249-B65C-4BD4-B9B3-9D1567073C59) -- thinking here about the ghostly nature of the film's body, and perhaps the idea that even in describing the film's body the language is seemingly only dancing around the idea (it's not quite able to get at it)
