# soma is tied to personal consciousness

_previous note:_ [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

> The word ‘soma’ derives from the ancient Greek description of a living body known to the self. Primary to its definition is the focus on living; once deceased, the soma no longer exists and the body itself remains. It is the living body that knows itself (Hanna, 1979). In a way, the idea of the soma is tied to personal consciousness in that it is not static but as dynamic as life itself.[@mullan-2014-somatics p.255]

- this is so curious not least the phrasing of "known to the self" and also "personal consciousness". I need to go back to the original article but it's possible that the term 'soma' has legacy re the self that is not entirely useful or just a bit odd. Consider in relation to [[losing oneself]] and [[nonduality]]

- [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing]]
- [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
