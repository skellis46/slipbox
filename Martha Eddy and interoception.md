# Martha Eddy and interoception

_previous note:_ [[interoception]]

These are the three moments in Eddy's book "Mindful Movement" in which she discusses interoception:

> In this text, and many others, proprioception is considered a type of interoception, grouped together with the sensing of autonomic functions of the organs (Batson and Wilson 2014; Craig 2003; Germer 2010). In a more pure context, proprioception is not focused on the viscera; it is therefore not considered interoception and is grouped separately. The main point of this is that the definition and registration of internal sensory experience is still in flux; the terms are being developed as the science of understanding how humans perceive their bodies is being discovered. Craig (2003) goes further to say that those sensations that related to autonomic functioning are the domain of interoception and those sensations that relate to voluntary activity such [as] cutaneous mechanoreception and proprioception that guide somatic motor activity are part of exteroception. What is important is that science is uncovering the mechanisms of self-awareness of the medical community is also recognizing the neurophysiological links for the bodymind connection. p.209

> As originally defined interoception encompassed just visceral sensations but now the term is used to include the physiological condition of the entire body and the ability of visceral afferent information to reach awareness and affect behaviour, either directly or indirectly. The system of interoception as a whole constitutes "the material me" and relates to how we perceive feelings from our bodies that determine our mood, sense of well-being and emotions. p.209

> ... somatic movement helps a person to practice not just "mindful awareness" but also "mindful responses." Somatic education, in part, teaches the art of staying aware of one's internal psychophysical experience while also responding through movement to external and indeed some internal sensory stimuli. p.210

> How teachers, DJs, movement therapists, massage therapists, physical therapists, occupational therapists and psychotherapists integrate a view of wholeness into their practice is dependent on their own embodiment and knowledge. This knowledge is best gained through sensory awareness, kinesthetic awareness and heightened perception using all bodily capabilities – interoception, exteroception and graviception (Batson and Wilson 2014; Russell and Arcuri 2015; King 2015) p.283
