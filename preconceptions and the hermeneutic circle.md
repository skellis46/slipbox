# preconceptions and the hermeneutic circle

_previous note:_  [[somatic feedback interrupts habits]]

---

Social scientist Sönke Ahrens writes that all human "intellectual endeavour"[@ahrens_how_2017 Chapter 7, n.p.] starts from pre-existing preconceptions, and can be transformed through research. He suggests that this kind of transformation through inquiry is akin to Gadamer's hermeneutic circle.

_questions & thoughts:_

- am thinking about the nature of intuition (see [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]), and its relationship to habit, practice and preconceptions. Where do these things come from?

_consider:_ 

- #toread Gadamer, Hans-Georg. 2004. Truth and Method. 2nd rev. edition. Trans. J. Weinsheimer and D. G. Marshall. New York: Crossroad
- [[internal and external attention]] -- comparing what we know and what we don't yet know to two different states of attention in somatic practices. The knowing body, the unknown body.
- [[search for truth]] -- comparing the pursuit of new understandings (from pre-conceptions) with Ingold
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
- [[gadamer and understanding as an event]]
