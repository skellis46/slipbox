# embodiment as mental representations in bodily formats

_previous note:_ [[embodiment and illusion of self]]

In [[Millman - Towards a Neurocognitive Approach to Dance Movement Therapy]] Millman describes how Dance Movement Therapists often refer to embodiment but that the term is "underspecified" [@millman-2021-neurocognitive n.pag.]  

She writes: 

> Goldman and de Vignemont (2009  p. 154) have explored ideas of embodied social cognition and define embodiment as the ‘mental representations in bodily formats that have an important role in cognition’. [@millman-2021-neurocognitive n.pag.]

Here's the full quote from Goldman and Vignemont:

> We offer several interpretations of embodiment, the most interesting being the thesis that mental representations in bodily formats (B-formats) have an important role in cognition. Potential B-formats include motoric, somato- sensory, affective and interoceptive formats [@goldman-2009-social p.154]

Note that this is from the abstract, and the article contains four different interpretations of embodiment. Note also the implicit (or perhaps explicit) elevation of cognition. Not yet clear to me how cognition in this case is distinct from either 'thinking' or 'consciousness'. And also not clear what a "mental representation in bodily" format is.
