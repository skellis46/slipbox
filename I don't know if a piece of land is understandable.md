# I don't know if a piece of land is understandable

_previous note:_ [[Murmurings of the Land]]

> I don't know if a piece of land is understandable. I think the ultimate defeat of your intent to understand it, is the understanding. That's why it's important. Because it's bigger than you, no matter how small it is. And ultimately your capacity to be grateful for being alive is rooted in the fact that everything is bigger than you.
