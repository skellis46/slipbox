# develop inner authority by listening to the body

_previous note:_ [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

>The quality of developing an inner authority by listening to the ‘voice’ of one’s own body is central to somatic theory. It is only by becoming more ‘in tune’ with ourselves that we may develop our abilities for personal transformation. Somatic work ultimately supports the idea that by ‘being engaged in attentive dialogue with one’s bodily self we, as humans, can learn newly, become pain free, move more easily, do our life work more efficiently, and perform with greater vitality and expressiveness’ (Eddy, 2009, p. 6).[@mullan-2014-somatics p.256]
