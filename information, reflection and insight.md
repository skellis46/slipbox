# information, reflection and insight

_previous note:_ [[research on, for and in the arts]]

---

Guy Armstrong's book -- _Emptiness: a practical guide for meditators_ -- is a look at understanding conceptually and practically the idea of _emptiness_ in Buddhist thinking and philosophy. 

In his introduction to the book, Armstrong describes the Buddha's Dharma ("truth" or "the way things are") and how there are three paths or avenues to learning the Dharma. He writes that each of the avenues "have differing degrees of power in their ability to transform us".[@armstrong_emptiness_2017 Introduction, n.p.] 

The three avenues are: understanding from hearing, understanding from reflection and understanding from meditative insight.

It struck me -- as I was reading _Emptiness_ -- that a version of these avenues might also be a way to understand the core methods of new insight through practice-research:

1. Understanding from information (reading, listening, watching, etc)
2. Understanding from reflection
3. Understanding from artistic practice (that is, insight from doing)

I suspect also that each of these avenues similarly have differing degrees of power in their ability to help us develop new understandings (or, if I push the analogy a bit further, to be epistemically transformed).
