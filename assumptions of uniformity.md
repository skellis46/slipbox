# assumptions of uniformity

_previous note:_ [[Levinas and the ethics of listening]]

---

In Chapter 4 of _You're Not Listening_ Kate Murphy steps into the realm of identity politics. She writes that we cannot know the experiences and realities of people "who are unlike us", but nor can we know (or claim to share) the "same mind-set or values of people we think are like us".[@murphy_youre_2020 Chapter 4, n.p.]

>When people say things such as, “Speaking as a white man,” or “Speaking as a woman of color,” that’s impossible. One can only speak for one’s self.[@murphy_youre_2020 Chapter 4, n.p.]

In other words, each of us has singular experiences that separate us from people who share the same identity markers.

>By listening, you might find comfort in shared values and similar experiences, but you’ll also find many points where you diverge, and it’s by acknowledging and accepting those differences that you learn and develop understanding. Our listening suffers from broadly applied and collective ideas of identity, which discourages discovery of what makes us and other people unique.

_questions & thoughts:_

- sits with my own going questioning of how demographic representations (of populations) map (if at all) to individuals.

_consider:_

- [[human experience and language]]
