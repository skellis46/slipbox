# types of noise

_previous note:_ 

Errors: bias and noise. Bias is the average error. Error that remains after bias is eliminated is noise. "Noise is variability in judgments that should be identical."[@kahneman-2021-noise p.363]

System noise: "unwanted variability in judgments that should ideally be identical"[@kahneman-2021-noise p.21]

Two types of system noise: 
1. _Level noise_: "is the variability of the average judgments made by different individuals".[@kahneman-2021-noise p.365] Different judgment scales mean different things to different people. For example, some judges are severe. "Level noise is variability in the average level of judgments by different judges" [p.78]
2. _Pattern noise_: reflects a complex pattern in judgments made in particular cases. In statistics this is called _statistical interaction_, e.g. judge x case interaction (judge-by-case). For example, one judge might be harsher than average in general, but more lenient with white-collar workers, etc. This is not mere chance. "Pattern noise is variability in judgesâ€™ responses to particular cases" [p.78] Pattern noise also includes a component Kahneman calls _occasion noise_: random error or variability due to transient effects.
