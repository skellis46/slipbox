# embodiment is when we are not lost in thought

_previous note:_ [[embodiment and illusion of self]]

While reading [[embodiment as mental representations in bodily formats]] it occurred to me that there is a clear difference between being embodied and being lost in thought. That even as I am thinking and writing here I can be aware of somatic sensations (both internal and external) yet I can also be 'lost in thought' as I think and write which places my body deep into the background such that I become lost in thought.
