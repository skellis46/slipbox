# staying in the pocket

Dear

There's a clip of Barack Obama (remember the normality of it all?) talking to David Letterman about the time Prince was performing at the White House and he (Prince that is) invited Obama's daughter Sasha on stage to dance, who in turn invited Obama on stage to join her. Obama tells Letterman that there's a thing that Dads have to do when they are dancing, and that is to "stay in the pocket".

The danger for a Dad is to leave the pocket and do things that you can't do, or should not do. That if you leave the pocket (and I'm extrapolating here) you might be ridiculed or shamed. 

In August this year, Lil and I went to a wedding in Sardegna. This brief note (after all, it has been a couple of months since I wrote to you) is to let you know that I did not stay in the pocket at the wedding. 

Not. One. Bit. 

Perhaps as a professional dancer (and as a non-Dad) I have some kind of special dispensation (a note from the teacher) to leave the pocket at will, but the people at the wedding did not know that, and nor was I wearing my "I'm a professional dancer" t-shirt. And the thing about Italian weddings is that people who are not dancing (mostly people my age or above) seem to sit in chairs around the dance floor watching all those moves being busted. I hope -- oh how I hope -- that they were not sitting there thinking:

Quel tizio non sta restando sicuramente nella tasca.
