# whalley - occlusionary tactics 

_previous note:_ [[a case for writing in practice-research]]

---

Bob Whalley's _Occlusionary Tactics_ is part photo essay, part reflection on the nature of practice-as-research. It's filled with materials that appear a little bit like advice ... but I don't feel advised.

These tactics of occlusion are direct and resolute and they make me wonder what aspects of my work as an artist I want to occlude. 

Whalley calls for things that "need stabilising"[@whalley_occlusionary_2020 p.243] (a body); to remember that there "always a glitch" [@whalley_occlusionary_2020 p.243]; that PaR is not linear; to find ways to reboot ourselves.

And throughout these tactics are images -- mostly images of nature -- whose labour is haunting and ambiguous; as if a nebulous skeleton to the writing. 

This chapter (never has a word seemed so inappropriate) is an artist working with their materials and understanding how these might be research-full (but not necessarily).

_thoughts & links:_

- this is a quite remarkable example of practice-research might exist both as artwork + writing, and 'artwork alone'. 
- [[information, reflection and insight]]
- see also Jacobs on [[future responsibility and stewardship]] -- something about promising towards the future
- [[hermeneutic circle]]
