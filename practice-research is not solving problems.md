# practice-research is not solving problems

>Panel 2 - Why practice matters – if practice is part of dance research, then what needs to change to reflect the value of practice as an epistemic system? for our Dance Research Matters event on Thursday 27th May.

- dance research matters: to whom? addressing audience. 
- which audience? 
- But dance is not taken seriously.

- not presenting my projects. why does practice-research matter? the value/need for practice-research.
- what can practice-research offer re funding screens. problems of translation to other audiences? 
- instrumentalisation of research vs for its own sake 
- practice-research existing between other communities (bridging communities)
- arguing for its importance

- 1999 50% -- I enrolled and started early the following year. Safe haven. As it still is in this day. A place for artists to do their work. 
- But it came with, and still comes with a particular pound of flesh. naive to imagine that placing or inserting my practice in research institution will not change what I do or how I understand it. And it ought to. But, like Newton's third law of gravity, the academy and those research institutions are also changed by the presence of artists. When I jump then land, I exert the same equal and opposite force on the earth as it does on me. I am moved by it, as it is moved by me. The difference is merely that of mass. And the mass of an institution like the Academy -- and places of research -- is changing, is being moved. These academics are trying to make sense when we in practice-research talk about alternate epistemologies, when we talk about embodied understandings, when we talk about   
- dance practice research matters. Statement reveals uncertainty. It's a claim. A land grab. It's riddled with self-doubt, like a toddler screaming, "don't you know I matter?" It's already a defensive position. Anyone or thing certain of themselves does not say "this is why I matter". It's assumed, or performed. Want to let that go. It has been 30 years more or less that practice has existed in the Uni system. Time to move on. Rather, it's the matters of practice-research that interest me. 
- two parts: 
	- instrumental -- this is the tide, and it's demanding to swim against. also presents opportunities. it begs/demands the question, "why does this research matter and to whom?" this is not a problem or issue peculiar to dance, and certainly not to practice-research. It's the air we breathe. But I think practice-research has something to offer here.
	- blue-sky; the uncertain, the implausible, the coming to grips with something. 
	- what then are our responsibilities?
		- to build robust cases for instrumental research

- practice in academia and practice out. Are we talking about the same thing? 

Thinking about instrumentalisation of research. Problem solving. As if all research is like an engineering or design problem. PaR seemed to be a way to think differently about research, more akin to pure science. Sense of wonder about the ways of the world. But as in science, that has more or less gone. Rather than make PaR something like this, it has been morphed into solving problems. 

It might have been an experience, or a way of asking questions ... to see feelingly, to see differently. PaR (as opposed to just making art -- want to draw the distinction) represents a way to understand and recognise the questions we ask of the practices, ourselves, of others, and of the world; the questions that emerge from these things; what becomes possible; what is afforded by these practices. 

P.60 solnit. Specific plane of abstraction. I'm think about PaR and it's place in the academy. I can't continue to hold this abstraction. That's where it's value lies but it's so fragile. So tenuous. So corruptible. So deeply submerged in finite longing for uncertainty. "He was incapable of keeping his mind on a sufficient plane of abstraction, where ideology and rhetoric fly more freely."
I understand that artist in the academy exists on a kind of plane of abstraction. There are the epistemic possibilities of traditional or perhaps conventional scholarly practices like science, in which we come to know things; and artistic practices which contravene such epistemic possibilities. Contradictions. What's more likely? -- that the brutal strength, traditions and conventions of the academy might whip artistic practice into shape, or that artistic practices might infect the academy with ... 

>Or perhaps they opposed the ravaging of the earth so that poetry too would survive in the world. A couple of years ago, a friend wrote me to urge me to focus on the lyrical end of my writing rather than activism and I wrote back, “What is the purpose of resisting corporate globalization if not to protect the obscure, the ineffable, the unmarketable, the unmanageable, the local, the poetic, and the eccentric? So they need to be practiced, celebrated, and studied too, right now.” I could have added that these acts themselves become forms of resistance; the two are not necessarily separate practices. Solnit, Hope, p.96

Toast. Buttered toast. The taste of cinnamon. Can't get rid of the taste. 
Something changed. The experience is fundamentally different. 

Biggs and Buchler: responsibility at two levels. 
Instrumentalisation is the terrifying and terrible part of the impact agenda. I'm not entirely against the agenda; many many good things have come from it, not least an awareness of how we might communicate understandings to the wider public. But, the very worst thing is this sense of "I do this and it produces this". It's a mentality that now runs deep in the academy. Like we are all engineers. Prototyping. But, in reality we are more akin to scientists or religious people (who themselves are far more a like than they'd mostly ever care to admit): seeking wonder, seeking the unknown, the inexplicable. Wonder. 


prep talk for conference thing (see “99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value” on Manifold @uminnpress = for PaR talk, not able to be quantified, but is in system of quantification. Paradox.
