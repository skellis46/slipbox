# practice-research is not solving problems

- practice in academia and practice out. Are we talking about the same thing? 

Thinking about instrumentalisation of research. Problem solving. As if all research is like an engineering or design problem. PaR seemed to be a way to think differently about research, more akin to pure science. Sense of wonder about the ways of the world. But as in science, that has more or less gone. Rather than make PaR something like this, it has been morphed into solving problems. 

It might have been an experience, or a way of asking questions ... to see feelingly, to see differently. PaR (as opposed to just making art -- want to draw the distinction) represents a way to understand and recognise the questions we ask of the practices, ourselves, of others, and of the world; the questions that emerge from these things; what becomes possible; what is afforded by these practices. 

P.60 solnit. Specific plane of abstraction. I'm think about PaR and it's place in the academy. I can't continue to hold this abstraction. That's where it's value lies but it's so fragile. So tenuous. So corruptible. So deeply submerged in finite longing for uncertainty. "He was incapable of keeping his mind on a sufficient plane of abstraction, where ideology and rhetoric fly more freely."
I understand that artist in the academy exists on a kind of plane of abstraction. There are the epistemic possibilities of traditional our perhaps conventional scholarly practices like science, in which we come to know things; and artistic practices which contravene such epistemic possibilities. Contradictions. What's more likely? -- that the brutal strength, traditions and conventions of the academy might whip artistic practice into shape, or that artistic practices might infect the academy with ... 

Toast. Buttered toast. The taste of cinnamon. Can't get rid of the taste. 
Something changed. The experience is fundamentally different. 

Biggs and Buchler: responsibility at two levels. 
Instrumentalisation is the terrifying and terrible part of the impact agenda. I'm not entirely against the agenda; many many good things have come from it, not least an awareness of how we might communicate understandings to the wider public. But, the very worst thing is this sense of "I do this and it produces this". It's a mentality that now runs deep in the academy. Like we are all engineers. Prototyping. But, in reality we are more akin to scientists or religious people (who themselves are far more like than they'd mostly ever care to admit): seeking wonder, seeking the unknown, the inexplicable. Wonder.
