# rendition and datafication

_previous note:_ [[an interface is always an effect]]

Zuboff uses the word _rendition_ to describe a two-sided process. On one side are the technologies of surveillance capitalism that are designed to "render our experience into data, as in rendering oil from fat".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.1] On the other side is the fact that "every time we encounter a digital interface we make our experience available to 'datafication'".[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.1] We _render_ "unto surveillance capitalism" a continuous supply of raw materials. 

The rendition of our bodies begins quite simply with our phones.[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 8.2]
