# The principle of the possibility of failure

The principle of the possibility of failure is a close friend to the principle of truth and limited claims. It acknowledges how rare failure seems to be in practice research, as if practice research always achieves what the artist-researchers said it would. This is absurd. 

Put simply, failure in practice research must be possible.
