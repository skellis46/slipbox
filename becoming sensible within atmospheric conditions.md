# becoming sensible within atmospheric conditions

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> Martin Welton asks what if ‘to live with, rather than in abstraction from’ the non-human of a tree or the wind might be a means where-by we become ‘sensible’? This becoming sensible ‘not only means an attunement to the sensory properties of individual objects, but also of one’s imbrication within atmospheric conditions’ (Welton 2018: 84). [@brown-2020-hau p.69]


_thoughts & links:_

- noting how in Italian _sensibile_ means to be sensitive
- related to those difficult conversations about personal responsibility in a global crisis (something Carol and Tia talk about later in the article - see [[to comprehend the scale of the crisis]])
-
