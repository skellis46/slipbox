# art is bad design on purpose

_previous note:_ [[noë - strange tools]]

---

In _Strange Tools_ Alva Noë writes that "A work of art is a strange tool; it is an implement or instrument that has been denuded of its function."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.] He states that art can _also_ be functional (his example is Duchamp's urinal that is both a toilet and an art work), but not solely. The fact that an art work can be both functional and disfunctional -- or "that art is one thing and technology is another" -- is important precisely because those differences are not inherent in the makeup of those things. Noë suggests that "what matters is how we use them."

He then compares art to design. Whereas design's role is to fall into the background -- to wear "the guise of nature" -- art pulls itself into the foreground: "Art starts when things get strange." ^ad29b3

>Design organizes and enables; art subverts. It does this by abrogating the background that needs to be in place for things to have their functions. You never ask, when confronted with a doorknob, What is this? For the question even to come up is for the doorknob’s utility already to have been undermined. If you even notice the knob, it’s potentially bad design.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.]

In other words, Noë suggests that "art is bad design on purpose."

>When we ask of a work of art What is this? What is this for? we need to come up with our own answer. And so we need to take a stand, a stand, critically, on our relation to the background, on our relation to that which we normally take for granted.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.]

Noë uses dance as another example. He suggests that the art of dance (choreography) "has nothing to do with dancing". He thinks that choreography uses the familiar aspects of social dancing and "manipulates and obscures these; it makes art out of these. Choreography, in a sense, is the interruption (or subversion) of dancing."

>Works of art illuminate the questions, as James Baldwin is said to have put it, that are occluded by the answers we already know.

>We are now in a position to see that this challenge that art poses—not only the challenge whether this or that work of art is any good but also whether this or that picture, or action, or object, or installation is even, in any sense, art at all—is one of art’s basic preoccupations and questions. Art is a problem for itself. Art is always, whatever else it is about, an engagement with other art, with artists, and audiences, and teachers and students. Art is, really, itself, a critical practice.

_questions & thoughts:_

--- 

_consider:_

- [[senses united by action]] -- the ways in which our actions make re-perceiving (or perceving anew) possible. That perhaps even art is a way of _triggering_ alternative actions that mold new perceptions
- see also Odell's [[habitual ways of seeing]] on this same point
