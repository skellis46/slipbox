# What the hell am I doing here?

Dear

Over the years I've listened to quite a bit of Radiohead but was never, well, right in there. "Creep" (released in 1992) is a song I know well but it never really bit me like songs are able to do. 

Perhaps you are familiar with [Pub Choir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub_Choir) that started in Brisbane in 2017? There are a number of similar groups now but the concept is pretty simple: gather a bunch of people together, arrange and practice a song, record/video it and then put it online.  

Here is Pub Choir's version of _Creep_:

There is such joy and beauty in it. But perhaps it's also seeing so many people singing in the first person, "I wish I was special ... I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here."

I cried. Inevitably. And now I just watched it again. And cried again. 

In _Intelligence of the Flesh: Why Your Mind Needs Your Body Much More Than It Thinks_ Guy Claxton writes:

> But no other animal, as far as we know, is moved to tears by a Mozart aria, or by witnessing undeserved kindness between people we do not know. The ability to be touched and moved by such things must surely count as amongst our more refined -- some would even say spiritual -- capacities; yet they manifest not as reasoned understanding, but as the overflowing of a weak saline disinfectant fluid from the sockets of the eyes. What further proof could we want that our highest sentiments are intimately connected with the workings of the body?

If you have some time you can also check out [Choir!'s version of Bowie's _Heroes_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7HJZPlJn_U) or [U2's _With or Without You_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaEKi7r3_kY) or Pub Choir having a go at [Kate Bush's _Running Up That Hill_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxWKjv_mc2Q)

I hope you go down a beautiful rabbit hole of people singing together.



PS Big big shout out to any arrangement that includes a Theremin.
