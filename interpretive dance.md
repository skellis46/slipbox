# interpretive dance

Back in June a scientist friend sent me a [TEDx video called Dance your PhD](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlDWRZ7IYqw).

I knew of the [Dance Your PhD _phenomenon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Your_Ph.D) but the video above is by the person who started it all: John Bohannon (with backing support from the dance company Black Label Movement). His premise is that we replace Powerpoint with dance. Yes, that somehow we employ dancers, and rehearse and produce choreographies to support or illustrate words. 

My skin crawls at the thought. Other than the forbidding economics of Bohannon's proposal, what is it that bugs me so much about what I see in that video? After all, these are fine dancers, and the YouTube comments on the video are overwhelmingly positive (itself no mean feat). Perhaps it's because I'm a snob and I don't like to admit it? Perhaps it's that no one really likes to see their practice so brutally instrumentalised? 

What I think Bohannon is doing with the entire _Dance Your PhD_ thing is to make dancers servants to concepts expressed in words. That is, he is using dance to interpret words. Interpretive dance. 

Interpretive dance is a joke. Literally. For example, [here](https://www.goodthingsguy.com/fun/david-armand-dont-stop-me-now/) -- seriously, watch it, it's David Armand and it's very funny. He has videos all over the internet spruiking the same thing. Or [using dance to solve Brexit](http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2019/04/24/brexit-impasse-to-be-solved-through-the-medium-of-interpretive-dance/) as one outcome from a web search of "through the medium of interpretive dance". Or the one about [Jeb Bush who "starts out as an egg and then goes on to reenact his childhood"](https://www.theonion.com/jeb-bush-debuts-one-man-presidential-campaign-tragedy-p-1819580349).

So what is interpretive dance? I suspect it is anything from historical modern dance (think Martha Graham) to mime, but generally tending towards the latter. Its conceit or role is to use dancing or movement to illustrate an idea. 

But isn't all artistic dance performing some version of illustrating an idea? Is my preciousness merely about an arbitrary quantity or quality of abstraction? That dancing that is closer to mime (and therefore less abstract) is less worthy than dancing that is more abstract, and thereby more opaque to _uninformed_ audiences (think "I didn't get it").

Then there are these [interpretive dances inspired by hydraulic presses squishing things](https://boingboing.net/2021/08/19/watch-wonderfully-funny-and-freaky-interpretive-dances-inspired-by-hydraulic-presses-squishing-things.html). I beg you to watch them now. They are remarkable, silly, creative, playful and compelling. They are also interpretive dance. 

The key difference from Bohannon's _shtick_ is that these videos are not representing language or words. Instead, there is a beautiful confluence between three things: 1) a clear relationship between the dancer and the event or object being interpreted; 2) a certain abstraction already present in seeing an everyday object crushed; and 3) the distance between the object and the danced interpretation affords absurdity, surprise and the space for me to use my imagination. 

I suspect that any time someone credits any of us the space to use our imaginations then they are treating us with an enormous amount of respect. 

Years ago I wrote a [blog piece about dance as a cheap joke](https://www.skellis.net/blog/cheap-joke) and I think I'll just restate the conclusion right here: I am an interpretive dancer.
