# interpretive dance

Back in June a scientist friend of mine sent me a TEDx video called _Dance your PhD_:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UlDWRZ7IYqw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I knew of the [Dance Your PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Your_Ph.D.) _phenomenon_ but this video is by the person who started it all: John Bohannon (with backing support from the dance company Black Label Movement). His premise is that we replace Powerpoint with dance. Yes, that somehow we employ dancers, and rehearse and produce choreographies to support or illustrate words. 

My skin still crawls at the thought. Other than the forbidding economics of Bohannon's proposal, what is it that bugs me so much about what I see in that video? After all, the YouTube comments on the video are overwhelmingly positive (itself no mean feat).

I think that perhaps it's because I'm a snob and I don't like to admit this. What I think Bohannon is doing with the entire _Dance Your PhD_ thing is to make dancers servants to concepts expressed in words. That is, dance that interprets words. Interpretive dance. 

Interpretive dance is a joke. Literally. For example, [here](https://www.goodthingsguy.com/fun/david-armand-dont-stop-me-now/) -- seriously, watch it, it's David Armand and it's very funny. He has videos all over the internet spruiking the same thing. Or [using dance to solve Brexit](http://www.newsbiscuit.com/2019/04/24/brexit-impasse-to-be-solved-through-the-medium-of-interpretive-dance/) as one outcome from a web search of "through the medium of interpretive dance".

So what is interpretive dance? I suspect it is anything from historical modern dance (think Martha Grahama) to mime, but generally tending towards the latter. That its role is to use dancing or movement to illustrate an idea. 

But isn't all artistic dance performing some version of illustrating an idea? Is my preciousness merely about an arbitrary quantity or quality of abstraction? That dancing that is closer to mime (and therefore less abstract) is less worthy than dancing that is more abstract, and thereby more opaque to _uninformed_ audiences (think "I didn't get it").

Then there are these [interpretive dances inspired by hydraulic presses squishing things](https://boingboing.net/2021/08/19/watch-wonderfully-funny-and-freaky-interpretive-dances-inspired-by-hydraulic-presses-squishing-things.html). I beg you to watch them now. They are remarkable, silly, creative, playful and compelling. They are also interpretive dance. 

What I think is different in them is some sense of surprise. That these hydraulic presses hook me into the idea (I immediately understand what is happening), while at the same time give me some space to fill in gaps of interpretation

instrumentalisation.
