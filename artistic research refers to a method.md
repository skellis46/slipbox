# artistic research refers to a method

>Are works of “artistic research” to be tested by a different eye? The new field of “artistic research” hinges paradoxically on the question of function. On the one hand, many find the emphasis on research to be a possible defense of art practice and of the critical discourse around it against the widespread instrumentalization of culture. When both the terms of the marketplace (production of spectacle, collectibles, the justifications of economics) and the public sphere (justified through supposed contributions to the “greater good”) threaten to overwhelm the cultural realm, the idea of “pure research” holds the appeal of a possible oasis. This earnest and good-faith motivation is what largely animates the present discussion.[p.62]

 >The emphasis on subject matter, experimental methods, and a dialogue between one’s own art making and the questions of art in general all are part of modern art. “Artistic research” then could be established as a process of formalization and concretization of what already exists, but which is under-defined: the visual arts as a highly intellectual field with its own questions and claims.[p.64]

>“Artistic research” must be judged by the same terms as art in general. If we disconnect from the traditions and capacities established in the last hundred years, we will not only throw out the baby with the bathwater, but (at the risk of mixing metaphors) we will also cut off the legs upon which we stand. The risk is not just the instrumentalization of art, but also the abolishment of art altogether in favor of some new form of design. The new field would turn out to be not an oasis, but a mirage.[@day_digging_2013 p.64]

>After all, “artistic research” must refer to a method, not to a subject. In ten years all these art PhDs will either be a laughingstock or will produce some works of demonstrable and self-evident substance. Perhaps the contrast of those potentialities would be a better starting point for a discussion.[@day_digging_2013 p.65]

>People pass by and mostly ignore him, but while we were there one man asked what he was doing. When told it was an art project the man asked, “Does art have some relationship to archeology?” Smith replied, “I guess it can.” Indeed, there is some relation.[p.65]

"He prefers to sustain the period of this kind of discovery, through digging, attending to the soil and ash, in which a different kind of information is possible, one that is not axiomatic or verifiable."[p.66]

- key for #finger-pointing-moon -- the balance with things that aren't self-evident, and unable to be verified.



>In this way, the efforts of the new field of research in art could shake off the dust of academicism and the false sense of purpose of bureaucracy, and instead actively foster those who dig in the ash and the dirt, and who insist on and demonstrate art’s capacity to wrestle with broader questions and concerns, in order to have some stake and status (and not just a function).[p.66]
