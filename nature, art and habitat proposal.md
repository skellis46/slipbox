I am an artist working with practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. I was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now live in London. I grew up in a politicised family environment where we often talked about things like human dignity, consumerism and even technology. These, in turn, have shaped my values as an artist, and underpin much of what my practice is about, and how it is conducted. I also think a lot about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and like to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

I have chosen these works to provide a sense of the breadth of my practice. They include writing, photography, dance and performance, and film. 

## This body (2022)

_This body_ is a collection of statements from people around the world responding to the question: "What is your body to you?". The work was first presented as part of an online performance-presentation to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts in January 2022, but will be added to and re-developed as an analogue box catalogue in 2023. 

This body is aging. This body makes things possible. This body is constantly reinventing itself. This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies. This body knows how to walk, run and dance. This body is not like the others. This body feels. This body grows. This body changes. This body is wounded. This body is bruised. This body sees and is seen. This body is a chameleon. This body has buried the bodies of others. This body adapts. This body has been exploited. This body cannot be known. This body will die. This body touches the earth. This body has a birthmark. This body is no longer the same. This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard". This body is at a loss. This body is enveloped by skin. This body is riddled with uncertainty. This body shares. This body houses these feelings. This body is consciousness and self-knowing. This body cannot escape technology. This body is unknown and cannot be known. This body is bleeding. This body has bled. This body was abused. This body marks the planet. This body is technological. This body is broken. This body is a time-traveler. This body is overwhelmed by detail. This body is the place through which experiences flood. This body is where I need to go. This body belongs to this mind. This body trusts you. This body consumes resources. This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory. This body is in pain. This body has no boundary. This body has betrayed me. This body is worthy of trust. This body is mine. This body walks. This body is always reinventing itself. This body is not far from death and I am not afraid. This body humbles me over and over again. This body takes pleasure. This body plays. This body is untouchable. This body participates.

## Women will always be blamed for everything (2016)

This is a 10 second film or vision that was created as part of Siobhan Davies and David Hinton’s project [The Running Tongue](http://www.siobhandavies.com/work/the-running-tongue). I include it here as an example of a mixed-media project incorporating performance, animation, and still and moving images.

## 6. Letter of personal motivation (300 words)

I am an experienced dance-artist, and have been making work for 30 years. In the last 5 years -- and exacerbated by the pandemic -- I've started to feel overwhelmed by, well, _stuff_ (akin to _roba_ in Italian). This feeling is acute in the conventions of dance and choreography in which large quantities of resources are poured into _being productive_ only for those productions to be consumed after just a few performances. The economist Kate Raworth describes this approach to the things we make as "take, make, use, lose."[^raworth] In other words, we take the Earth's materials, make them into things we want or like, use them a bit (or perform them), and then they are discarded or lost.  

I approach this proposed residency at _Nature, Art & Habitat_ profoundly motivated to break this pattern of unsustainable productivity. That my experience and expertise in movement, film, writing and artistic research might be channeled into understanding anthropogenic climate change through and in the body; and to wrestle with what it means to inhabit a body -- a human body -- in this time of the anthropocene extinction.

But, above all, I want to participate in the community in the Taleggio valley, to (as gently as possible) mark and be marked by that terrain, to be in conversation, and to contribute and share experiences and ideas for the common good.

## 7. Project Proposal:** A one-page description (500 words) of the project that the applicant would pursue during her/his stay at NAH_R_. The proposal, must clearly:

> Priority of selection will be given to proposals that demonstrate direct engagement with the surrounding nature and human habitat, through both objectives and methods, and to those that reveal the ability to leave a mark on the Taleggio Valley.   
> If external funding is available to applicant please indicate it at the end of the project proposal page.

_Soil as deep time. Soil as a memory keeper. Soil as a future protector. Soil as planet._ 

This research project is called _Footfall_ and it is about time. The project reveals my desire to understand, interpret and represent a temporal scale of the human body that is out of step with ecological time. The research will be built on the rhythm of human walking and how this action -- a simple cyclical pattern of the body falling and catching itself -- might frame the more complex and less visible rhythms of the earth and its soil. The strike of the heel that starts the sound of footfall in human walking marks a quintessential meeting point or interface between the anthropic and natural worlds. When we walk, we trample the soil and leave a metaphorical and literal footprint as a register of human impact. But it is also through walking that we humans most directly feel this "critical zone just beneath our feet."[^critical] 

The research falls under NAHR's _Body Performing Nature_ domain and draws on cross-disciplinary practices of dance, film and eco-somatics.[^eco] The humility,[^humility] dignity and insignificance of the human body is central to the practices. Yet, paradoxically, I want to seek ways to background the body while foregrounding ecological time frames -- the time of nature and soil. 

The research's artefact will be a series of experimental time-lapse films. Time-lapse photography is the _sine qua non_ film technique in nature documentaries, as if we humans now experience nature vicariously -- mediated through the passage of time sped-up as animated photographs. 

In the movement-performance-film experiments located in the Taleggio valley landscape I will use the cliché of the nature documentary time-lapse to re-cast the human body's relationship to soil and earth. These time-lapses will be familiar, perhaps even comforting given their connection to TV presenters like David Attenborough in the UK, or Alberto Angela in Italy. Yet, as each time-lapse self-consciously animates the passage of time in the landscape and soil, the human body in frame will perform radically or implausibly slow simple movements in reverse. The goal or desire in this research is to foreground a body in opposition to the time of soil; to re-render how time is experienced and seen in the resistance of the body as gravity unflinchingly pulls the body towards the soil from which it came.  

These photographic and physical practices will present a complex technological and physical challenges ideal for artistic research: how to modify and adapt anthropic postures, gestures and movements such that they pull the human body out of the temporal order of the natural environment? At the same time, time-lapse and film technologies demand sensitivity to the moral and ethical implications of the tools and practices at our disposal: "What was required of the earth so that I might be able to use this technology? ... What possibilities for action does this technology present? Is it good that these actions are now possible? ... What assumptions about the world does the use of this technology tacitly encourage?"[^moral]

, but I am also at a crossroads. I have increasingly come to recognise that (resources). fueled by interest in climate crisis and how I might come to understand and communicate expereinces of that crisis through/in the body. 
wrestle with what it means to be a dancer -- to inhabit a human body -- in time of great exstinction.

To be a body performing _out of time in the time of_ nature.

- To be sensitive to the [[moral and ethical implications of our tools]]
- stress / softness -- this is the corporeal research: to inhabit (and render) ecological time. Slow slow slow. Long traditions in dance and performance, Butoh. "the timeless present we call now";[Kabat-Zinn in @mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon n.pag.] where we breathe and move out of clock time and into non-judgemental awareness. But in different frames/perspectives and the time of the time-lapse (.) 


Such practices have a long history in dance and performance, from Butoh to Rosemary Lee's Meltdown.[^melt]

[^melt]: [artsadmin.co.uk/media/documents/promoters/Rosemary%20Lee_Meltdown_Ed.pdf](https://www.artsadmin.co.uk/media/documents/promoters/Rosemary%20Lee_Meltdown_Ed.pdf) 


This is a paradox based on a body in presence (expressed as non-judgemental awareness the underpins somatic dance practices)

This is a radically analogue human body practicing the non-judgemental awareness the underpins somatic dance practices; it is a body that meets and is sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.


that juxtapose .. Their effect will be to radically slow down the body in motion against the seemingly sped-up landscapes of the Taleggio valley. These experiments will happen using wide framings of the natural surrounds, and also tightly framed parts of the body moving in hyper-slow in the soil. 

And under such conditions of stress, strain, and pressure, if we collapse into the various and shiny short-term futures that are always pulling us, cajoling us, haunting us, then I think we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as it is, and the body as a means to be a good ancestor. The body de-instrumentalised is radically in the present of awareness, and is not judged or massaged for other short-term future means. This is a body filled with the humility and dignity of its insignificance, while profoundly aware of bodies yet to be.

"holding the whole body in awareness"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon] but only in the background. To background these practices against local ecological time. Different framings. 

The work is inspired by reconceptions of human time including the concept of being a good ancestor.  

Second part is a series of conversations with local artisans and crafts people. (B2 italian). That each of these people walks on the earth, but perhaps with a different rhythm.


We tramp on the soil, we catch and fall ourselves with each stride. Walking is the primary means by which we conduct or transmit our bodily selves on and with the planet. 

> **Domain 3. Body Performing Nature**Artwork production and critical embodied investigations that articulate our relationship to nature, landscape, sustainability and ecology though creative movement of the human body. Proposals may include all types of embodied performances, dance, and site specific choreographies.

What then for how we steward and research the body in motion and the body at rest? And how might such stewardship reflect the hard to fathom rhythms of the climate crisis?

marks the background of the visual and sonic worlds of the art  , but also ambivalent: What if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? 

I propose to draw attention to the time of walking so that we might recognise and remember what geochemists call the _critical zone_: that thinnest of thin layers of our planet where "everything we care for and everything we have ever encountered exists"?[^latour]

[^latour]: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/24/pandemic-earth-lockdowns-climate-crisis-environment](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/24/pandemic-earth-lockdowns-climate-crisis-environment)

Perhaps only then might we continue to understand and be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else, including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, and measured. These are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies to be swiped or scrolled. These are radically analogue bodies deep in non-judgmental awareness that are meeting and sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.
