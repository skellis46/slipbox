## 3. Current CV** ( max. 3 pages) outlining relevant experience
  
## 4. Three References** name and contact information

- Carol Brown
- Jonathan Burrows / Eddie Nixon
- Siobhan Davies
- Katrina McPherson


  
## 5. Portfolio** of selected relevant projects published, performed, exhibited, or otherwise publicly presented during the last five years. (max 10 pages)

## 6. Letter** of personal motivation (300 words)

I am an experienced dance-artist, but I am also at a crossroads. I have increasingly come to recognise that (resources). fueled by interest in climate crisis and how I might come to understand and communicate expereinces of that crisis through/in the body. 
  
## 7. Project Proposal:** A one-page description (500 words) of the project that the applicant would pursue during her/his stay at NAH_R_. The proposal, must clearly:

> 1. address this yearâ€™s NAH_R_ research project and preferred [domain](https://nahr.it/About) 
> 2. describe your research topic and its outcome: an artifact (painting, sculpture, installation), an image, a research paper, a food recipe, a structure, a process, a thematic path. The candidate will be held accountable for the delivery of the proposed outcome.  
  
> Priority of selection will be given to proposals that demonstrate direct engagement with the surrounding nature and human habitat, through both objectives and methods, and to those that reveal the ability to leave a mark on the Taleggio Valley.   
> If external funding is available to applicant please indicate it at the end of the project proposal page.  

Soil as deep time. Soil as a memory keeper. Soil as a future protector. Soil as planet. 

This research project is called _Footfall_ and it is about time. It reveals my desire to understand, interpret and represent a temporal scale of the human body that is out of step with ecological time. The research will be built on the rhythm of human walking and how this action -- a simple cyclical pattern of the body falling and catching itself -- might frame the more complex and less visible rhythms of the earth and its soil. The strike of the heel that starts the sound of footfall in human walking marks a quintessential meeting point between the anthropic and natural worlds. When we walk, we trample the soil and leave a footprint -- both literally and metaphorically -- as a register of human impact. But it is also through walking that we humans most directly feel this "critical zone just beneath our feet."[^critical] 

The research falls under NAHR's _Body Performing Nature_ domain and draws on cross-disciplinary practices of dance, film and eco-somatics.[^eco] The humility and dignity of the human body's presence and insignificance is central to the practices. Yet, paradoxically, I want to seek ways to background the body while foregrounding natural ecological time frames -- the time of soil. 

The research's artefact will be a series of experimental time-lapse films. Time-lapse photography is the _sine qua non_ film technique in nature documentaries, as if we humans have come to know nature through the passage of time sped-up through photographs animated as film. In the movement-performance-film experiments located in the Taleggio valley landscape I will use the cliche of the nature time-lapse to render the insignificance and perhaps even absurdity of the human body set amongst and in. 


The time-lapses will be familiar, perhaps even comforting given their connection to presenters like David Attenborough in the UK, or ... in Italy. 


that juxtapose .. Their effect will be to radically slow down the body in motion against the seemingly sped-up landscapes of the Taleggio valley. These experiments will happen using wide framings of the natural surrounds, and also tightly framed parts of the body moving in hyper-slow in the soil.  These photographic and physical practices present complex physical challenges: how to modify and adapt anthropic postures, gestures and movements such that they pull the human body out of the temporal order of the natural environment? For

- To be sensitive to the [[moral and ethical implications of our tools]]
- stress / softness -- this is the corporeal research: to inhabit (and render) ecological time. Slow slow slow. Long traditions in dance and performance, Butoh. "the timeless present we call now";[Kabat-Zinn in @mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon n.pag.] where we breathe and move out of clock time and into non-judgemental awareness. But in different frames/perspectives and the time of the time-lapse (.) To be a body performing _out of time in the time of_ nature. 

This is a paradox based on a body in presence (expressed as non-judgemental awareness the underpins somatic dance practices)

This is a radically analogue human body practicing the non-judgemental awareness the underpins somatic dance practices; it is a body that meets and is sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.



Through the practices, I will seek to 




> 2. The anthropic and natural worlds are closely interconnected. While the natural world manages to adapt and re-colonize in a relatively short time, the anthropic world has much more difficulty in adapting. Preserving and restoring our ecosystem needs to be a central point of research in terms of both preservation of ecosystem services and environmental protection. <https://nahr.it/Current-Program>





I propose to do this by practicing and developing

And under such conditions of stress, strain, and pressure, if we collapse into the various and shiny short-term futures that are always pulling us, cajoling us, haunting us, then I think we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as it is, and the body as a means to be a good ancestor. The body de-instrumentalised is radically in the present of awareness, and is not judged or massaged for other short-term future means. This is a body filled with the humility and dignity of its insignificance, while profoundly aware of bodies yet to be.

"holding the whole body in awareness"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon] but only in the background. To background these practices against local ecological time. Different framings. 

The work is inspired by reconceptions of human time including the concept of being a good ancestor.  

Second part is a series of conversations with local artisans and crafts people. (B2 italian). That each of these people walks on the earth, but perhaps with a different rhythm.


We tramp on the soil, we catch and fall ourselves with each stride. Walking is the primary means by which we conduct or transmit our bodily selves on and with the planet. 

> **Domain 3. Body Performing Nature**Artwork production and critical embodied investigations that articulate our relationship to nature, landscape, sustainability and ecology though creative movement of the human body. Proposals may include all types of embodied performances, dance, and site specific choreographies.

What then for how we steward and research the body in motion and the body at rest? And how might such stewardship reflect the hard to fathom rhythms of the climate crisis?

marks the background of the visual and sonic worlds of the art  , but also ambivalent: What if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? 

I propose to draw attention to the time of walking so that we might recognise and remember what geochemists call the _critical zone_: that thinnest of thin layers of our planet where "everything we care for and everything we have ever encountered exists"?[^latour]

Perhaps only then might we continue to understand and be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else, including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, and measured. These are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies to be swiped or scrolled. These are radically analogue bodies deep in non-judgmental awareness that are meeting and sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.
