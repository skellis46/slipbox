# seizing and freezing

> Rethinking isn’t a struggle in every part of our lives. When it comes to our possessions, we update with fervor. We refresh our wardrobes when they go out of style and renovate our kitchens when they’re no longer in vogue. When it comes to our knowledge and opinions, though, we tend to stick to our guns. Psychologists call this seizing and freezing. We favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt, and we let our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We laugh at people who still use Windows 95, yet we still cling to opinions that we formed in 1995. We listen to views that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard.[@grant-2021-think n.pag.]

- thinking in relation to [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]] and how difficult it is to change cultural norms
- also with Kahneman's idea that we can't change people's minds (metaphor of the spring): [[culture, assumptions and beliefs#^4f0c9f]] -- the podcast is [https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/daniel-kahneman/](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/daniel-kahneman/)
- [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]]

- What's the point in having a mind if we never change it? - James O'Brien <https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/blog/2020/290-james-obrien>

>We’re not aware of changing our minds even when we do change our minds. And most people, after they change their minds, reconstruct their past opinion – they believe they always thought that.

- famous Kahneman quote (!) (should track it down)
