# all through the body are hands and eyes

_previous note:_ [[the Dao of butchering cows]]

> Yunyan asked Daowu: “How does the Bodhisattva of Great Mercy use all those hands and eyes?”
Daowu said, “It’s like reaching behind you for a pillow in the night.”
Yunyan said, “I understand.”
“Really? What do you understand?”
“There are hands and eyes all over the body.”
Daowu said, “That’s nicely put, but it’s not the whole picture.”
Yunyan said, “How would you put it?”
Daowu said, “All through the body are hands and eyes.”[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 12 The Bodhisattva’s Great Mercy n.pag]


- This koan confuses me beautifully. How might I understand the function of the hands and eyes? Hands and eyes are the soul of _craft_. It makes me think of Yuk Hui's story of the Dao of butchering cows.
