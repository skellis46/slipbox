# allostasis and body budgeting

_previous note:_ [[Feldman Barrett - Seven and a Half Lessons about the Brain]]

Allostasis refers to the work the body does to budget for its specific needs in anticipation of those needs. 

> Allostasis is the efficient regulation required to prepare the body to satisfy its needs before they arise by budgeting those needed resources such as oxygen, insulin etc., as opposed to homeostasis, in which the goal is a steady state. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostasis>

Proposed by Peter Sterling and Joseph Eyer in 1988 as a means to deal with the idea that the body has varying energy needs and not everything is in a steady state. 

From Feldman Barrett (which is where the idea really stuck with me -- even though I see a note in [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing]]):

> The scientific name for body budgeting is allostasis. It means automatically predicting and preparing to meet the body’s needs before they arise [@feldmanbarrett-2021-seven loc 109].

> Your brain’s most important job is to control your body​—​to manage allostasis​—by predicting energy needs before they arise so you can efficiently make worthwhile movements and survive [@feldmanbarrett-2021-seven loc 137].
