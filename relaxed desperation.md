# relaxed desperation

Dear

A few weeks ago I got to spend a couple of days working with the MA Screendance students at The Place in London. The course is run by Katrina McPherson, a long-term collaborator and longer-term friend who was also in the studio as together she and I tried to figure out what was going on. 

At the start of the second day, we played a game in which the goal was to take selfies that included at least one other person, while attempting to avoid having our photos taken by other people. We also used the regular back camera on our phones (not the selfie camera) so we couldn’t see what was in frame. It was somewhat anarchic but also a welcome relief from the first day when I think I bogged the group down in too much writing and reflection. 

Here are some of my fave pics from that activity.

I wasn’t at The Place to teach screendance. The MA students already get a lot of nuts and bolts information about framing, cameras, editing etc. Rather, I was there to workshop what _artistic research_ (which tends to be called practice research in the UK) might mean and feel like when making dance films. 

I think that a fundamental idea of practice research is to reduce the focus on outcomes (or products) and stay with and in the unknown space of the creative process as long as is feasible. This is difficult in any MA (or BA) programme in which the point increasingly seems to be about outcomes. Such difficulty is exacerbated by the students’ experiences at primary and high school where ‘getting good marks’ will have been the air they breathed

So, in a small way, Katrina and I opened the door towards staying with playful processes that hold off on understanding what the films are, and instead focus on what they could be. Under most circumstances (either in higher education or in the professional world) such a focus on process is somewhat artificial. No matter how much we stay with the creative play or the sense that during the process many many different films _could_ be made, we all understand that at some point there will be something to present – an outcome of some kind. Occasionally I describe this tension between staying immersed in process while knowing there will be an outcome as _relaxed desperation_.

What I am really talking about here is a genuine attitude and spirit of openness while being in process. Remaining open would also be useful for someone who is making a film _about_ something and has a storyboard, characters etc. That is, even with a heavily produced (or choreographed?) film-making process, being open to _what could be_ is vital. Yet, under these conditions we tend to quickly and even automatically get locked into the machinations of production, budgets and delivery.

The MA students at The Place start to move into their final _big_ projects now. I hope that each of them can stay open and open and open as long as is possible to what the films could be, and end up being genuinely surprised by the films as they emerge out of the complex and beautiful space of not knowing; a space that competes so unsympathetically with a _good outcome_.
