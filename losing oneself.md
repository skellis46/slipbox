# losing oneself

_previous note:_ [[index - losing oneself]]

- [[losing oneself bid preparation.canvas|losing one's self bid preparation]]

- [[flow]], improvisation, [[DMN]], [[TPN]], [[interoception]], [[consciousness-as-such]], [[MPE]] -- similar to full absorption states? 
- Characterised by losing one's self in the activity. 
- in sport, the flow state is highly sort after (associated with peak performance) but mostly occurs seemingly by chance. See Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi 1999 (book)
- noting here that the DMN tends towards negative feelings (but lost track of where I read this)
- Importance that the practice is not goal oriented (the [[authentic movement]]). There is no "good" or "bad" AM. 


> The research of Sheldon et al. (2015) [...] found that mindfulness may interfere with the absorption facet of flow, but not with other aspects of flow. [@schutte-2023-connection p.1]

- are these experiences in this (non-therapeutic) version of [[authentic movement]] an experience of [[nonduality]]? My hunch is that they are not ... but would like them to be (!)
- what is relationship between nonduality and flow? See [[flow and nonduality]]
- self-transcendent experiences (STE): awe and flow (see PhD, Canning 2023: Forgetting The Self: Nondual Awareness As A Key Component Of Selftranscedent Experiences) -- see [[to study the self is to forget the self]]
- large body of work on flow and meditation (or meditative states). Key question becomes, "what is particular about the experience of this version of [[authentic movement]]?" Also, how is the version of AM I practice different from the traditional form? 
- one initial response to this question (and based on nine dimensions of [[flow]]) is that AM is not goal oriented. But perhaps also it doesn't meet challenge-skill balance, and the idea of unambiguous feedback. AM is also a richly 'thick' cognitive experience -- or imagistic? It's certainly NOT an [[MPE]]
- what is difference between self-awareness and self-consciousness? I'd suggest that AM expands self-awareness -- but in the sense of it happening to a 'version of me' and decreases self-consciousness. Not sure about this though. See p.1640 of Lynch & Troy [@lynch-2021-role]. This is relevant: 

> While phenomenological aspects of nonduality may be realized and described during particular experiences, nondual awareness describes consciousness that is inherently aware of itself (Dunne et al., 2019; Josipovic, 2019). [@lynch-2021-role p.1641]

See also [[flow and nonduality]]

- see [[Julianna M. Lynch & Allison S. Troy - The Role of Nonduality in the Relationship Between Flow States and Well-Being]] for literature note
- in [[van Vugt - Ballet as a Movement-Based Contemplative Practice Implications for Neuroscientific Studies]] she writes how: 

> Interestingly, while ballet dancers tend to use meta-cognition to ensure that they are still delivering the correct product (dance) to the audience, contemplatives use meta-cognition to primarily observe their own mental state. The meta-cognition that dancers use, in view of a project delivery is typically highly critical and judgmental, while yogis train to observe their mind and body with a non-judgmental attitude. It could even be said that an important function of meta-cognition in contemplation is monitoring whether or not one is reacting judgmentally. Consequently, comparing dancers and contemplatives on meta-cognition would be an interesting way to isolate externally-directed from internally-directed meta-cognition. Moreover, it will be interesting to see whether those two types of meta-cognition are associated with different neural correlates, along the lines of the suggested difference between meta-cognition of emotions and bodily state versus cognitive states ([Fox and Christoff, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00513/full#B10)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyyk9tdh7wsa37ams1jw5316))
- my thought here is that [[authentic movement]] is so much closer to meditation than it is to the kind of dancing they are talking about here (and just how limited everyday understanding of dancing is)
## methods

- [[ecological momentary assessment]]
- self-report questionnaires (see below)

## self-report questionnaires

- see also list of body awareness scales in [[embodied intelligence project#^5f1187]]
- these tests are in the Losing One's Self finder folder:
		+ Body Awareness Questionnaire [@shields-1989-body] -- apparently this is very dated
		+ Five Facet Mindfulness Q [@baer-2008-construct]
		+ [[Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness – Version 2 (MAIA-2)]] [@mehling-2018-multidimensional]
- also Body Vigilance Scale in [[L.S. Merritt Millman - Online Structured DanceMovement Therapy Reduces Bodily Detachment in Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder]]
	+ Body Perception Questionnaire? [@kolacz-2023-body]

> (a) Questionnaires are instruments distant from the process. The least accurate instruments are, for example, questionnaires pertaining to bodily perception (example: Autonomic Perception Questionnaire, APQ, Mandler et al., 1958; overview on other questionnaires, see Weitkunat, 1987). These questionnaires give an indication of the judgements of subjects about their interoceptive capabilities; a correlation with physiologically measurable parameters usually is not found. [@vaitl-1996-interoception] 


## Some possible key structural aspects:

- dance improvisation (perhaps something useful in [@martin-2019-feeling]?)
- consciousness and dance improvisation - terminology: awareness, attention, consciousness
- authentic movement - see [@bacon-2015-authentic] for overview
- dance and phenomenology (and contrast with [[neurophenomenology]]? -- (see [@lutz-2003-neurophenomenology] and also [@cosmelli-2007-mountains] in Readwise and on PDF). 
- flow of experience, e.g. <https://read.readwise.io/new/read/01gzdn0v5p8fd6x6veazs5er05> [@cosmelli-2007-mountains]-- analysis of [[binocular rivalry]] to understand flow of subjective experience. This paper is brilliant -- distinctive cf the dance improvisation lit.
- DMN and TPN [[switch in attentional focus]]
- flow (see [[focal things and engagement]])
- the self (see [[consciousness and the self]]; [[embodiment and illusion of self]])

Exclude:
- [[embodiment and emotions]]?
- 

This note is the beginning of an attempt to draw together several trains of thought including:

- [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]
- [[authentic movement]]
- [[interoception glossary]]
- [[the lived body and embodiment]]
- various notes and ideas surrounding embodiment with [[whole physical body minus the brain]] and [[dance and embodiment]] being good places to start (with the latter containing potentially useful legacy information)
- flow -- large body of work here, and Barbara Montero's work is essential

> Phenomenology, first established by Edmund Husserl, studies consciousness and its embodied processes (Husserl [1900] 1970). Its teachings hold that features of experience appear and transform in consciousness. [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]

- Fraleigh also mentions non dual awareness and Dogen Zen [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]. 
- see also [[Garfield - Losing Ourselves]] re immersed phenomenology
- and perhaps also [[Seth - Being You]] for more on value of phenomenology

## notes from bid writing sprint (April 2023)

- losing one's self:
	+ flow (sport), peak experience, consiousness-as-such (Metzinger), ego-less experiences, non-dual awareness, and minimal phenomenal experiences (episodes of greatly reduced or even absent phenomenal content) akin to full absorption states. 
	+ characterised by sense of 'losing one's self in the activity
	+ MPE: two views that are conflated [@josipovic-2020-nondual n.pag.] - [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]
	+ dmn - active when at rest; see [[interoception glossary]] and [[AIDAN LYON - What Is Meditation, and Why Should You Do It]]



- claims
- methodological issues 
- interoception as anchor
- Compare with daydreaming -- this is talking about NDA in improv. Like aware day dreaming.
- extremely human activities: gossip, argue, playing games, travelling for pleasure and dance
- further evidence of fundamental nature. 
- kinds of dancing: mostly social 
- photographing that which cannot be photographed -- like an artistic component? low-resolution

## output strategies and possibilities

- use of gifs here <https://stimming.me/>
- video essay
- multi-camera setup?? (like Naccarato)
