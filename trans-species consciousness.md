# trans-species consciousness

_previous note:_ [[kinship bid]]

20251119 - Email response from Tom Goodwin:

> I think that what we mean by trans species consciousness is an attempt to decentre the solely human experience that in our current society can tend towards extraction on a large spectrum from using nature for well-being purposes to the other extreme of extraction on a wider scale. Both of which do not include nature as a living entity deserving of our utmost respect.

> I would like to attempt to explore a more universal nonhuman centric approach or at least recognise the human centric limitations of our work. I am aware that this kind of language may not fit into the project proposal – I just want to communicate my sensibility or thinking around ethics.

My question to them: 

Something like the way in which human and more-than-human lives ‘co-constitute’ each other’s perceptions and experience? Is Kohn’s "How Dogs Dream: Amazonian Natures and the Politics of Transspecies Engagement” relevant here? <https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2007.34.1.3>
