# embodiment and illusion of self

_previous note:_ [[Annaka Harris - Harris-2019-Conscious]]

> For example, like everyone else, I have the absurd tendency to regard “my body” (including “my head” and “my brain”) as something my conscious will inhabits—when in fact everything I think of as “me” is dependent on the functioning of my brain. Even the slightest neural changes, via intoxication, disease, or injury, could render “me” unrecognizable. Yet I can’t seem to shake the false intuition that I could even choose to leave my body (if I could only figure out how) and everything constituting “me” would somehow remain magically intact. It’s easy to see how human beings across the globe, generation after generation, have effortlessly constructed various notions of a “soul” and descriptions of life after death that bear a striking resemblance to life before death.[@harris-2019-conscious loc 259]

- This bit of writing got me thinking about the possibility that _embodiment_ is the recognition of this illusion (or false intuition). That whatever 'me' is it is predicated on the concreteness of the body (which includes the brain). 
- [[the lived body and embodiment]]
- Harris focuses on functioning of brain but other evidence for experimence being far more distributed through body e.g. [[4e cognition]] (I think I have this right)

Also:

> We run into a combination problem only when we drag the concept of a “self” or a “subject” into the equation. But we know that the idea of the self, as a concrete entity, is an illusion. It’s admittedly a very tough illusion to relinquish, but I think the solution to the combination problem is that there is really no “combining” going on at all with respect to consciousness itself. Consciousness could persist as is, while the character and content change, depending on the arrangement of the specific matter in question. Maybe content is sometimes shared across large, intricately connected regions and sometimes confined to very small ones, perhaps even overlapping.[@harris-2019-conscious loc 892]
