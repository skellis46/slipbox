# What are we calling the self?

_previous note:_ [[the body as an object of special regard]]]

> When we're not looking deeply into our experience, into the nature of our experience, and simply live in the world of surface appearances, what happens is, we create a reference point for all experience, a someone to whom all experience is happening. We're creating this notion of a self behind experience to whom it's happening. How much of our sense of self comes from a superficial perception of the body? No, it seems so solid. And it's the first, you know, who are you? This is me, I was so easy to identify with the body as being self. Some years ago, I saw an ad in the New York Times for T shirt. ... the writing on the t shirt said, me, me, me. And I had mentioned this in a talk. And sometime later, a yogi gave me a president of a T shirt. And it said, not me, not me, not me.

> You know, when we really investigate and examine the body more closely, we see that it's a composite of so many different interrelated systems, you know, the skeletal system, muscles and the organs and the circulatory system, and the nervous system. There's so many different systems going on. But if we saw, you know, the liver or the bladder, oh, yeah, that's me. We wouldn't be identifying with it. But we wrap it all up very nicely in skin, you know, we create this very nice package. And then it's very easy, as we all know, to get attached to it. We get attached to our own body, we get attached to these other nice packages that are out there. How attached would we be if we had x-ray vision, and could really see what was going on. And one of the important consequences of taking this body as being self is the fear of losing it, you know, and the fear of death. And of course, if we look on an even deeper level, on the cellular level, or on the, you know, atomic level, there's almost nothing here. I read someplace that if all the space were taken out, from the material, the actual material elements that make up the body, that all that remain if all the space were removed, all that would remain would be the size of a particle of dust. So what is it that we're calling self?
