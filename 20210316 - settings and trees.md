# 20210316 - settings and trees

Did a few more tests with settings, and also in the trees to see what went on. Struggled with settings frankly. Some not clear. Audio has this kind of low frequency 'clicking' on it -- possibly the bluetooth connection that I turned on? 

1. 11_GOPR8090.MP4: 1080p, 120fps, N FoV, 5500k, GoPro Color, shutter: 480, ISO: 480. Slightly on dark side.
2. 12_GOPR8091.MP4: 1080p, 120fps, N FoV, 5500k, GoPro Color, shutter: 240, ISO: 480. slightly overexposed. My guess here will be to use auto shutter
3. 13_GOPR8092.MP4: shutter 120. very over-exposed.
4. 14_GOPR8093.MP4: no idea of settings but tried doing some growling #sound and some singing. So so rich.  ^e91f53 -- kicks in at 4:18 in _14_GOPR8093.MP4 15fps_

So yes to working with shutter in auto mode like in [[20210309 - playing and catching#^8e9d07]]

#ideatotry what to place on the ground as 'scenographic' objects. e.g. survival kit (orange survival blanket?), backpack, clothing. Orientation. Even take my bicycle?  ^36358e

Note that the airplane / aeroplane appears at beginning of 06_GOPR8081.MP4. Bicycle also appears in the same shot.
