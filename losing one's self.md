# losing one's self

_previous note:_ [[index - losing one's self]]

- [[losing one's self bid preparation.canvas|losing one's self bid preparation]]

Some possible key structural aspects: 
- dance improvisation 
- consciousness and dance improvisation - terminology: awareness, attention, consciousness
- dance and phenomenology (and contrast with [[neurophenomenology]]? -- (see [@lutz-2003-neurophenomenology] and also [@cosmelli-2007-mountains] in Readwise and on PDF). 
- flow of experience, e.g. <https://read.readwise.io/new/read/01gzdn0v5p8fd6x6veazs5er05> [@cosmelli-2007-mountains]-- analysis of [[binocular rivalry]] to understand flow of subjective experience. This paper is brilliant -- distinctive cf the dance improvisation lit.
- DMN and TPN [[switch in attentional focus]]
- flow (see [[focal things and engagement]])
- the self (see [[consciousness and the self]]; [[embodiment and illusion of self]])

Exclude:
- [[embodiment and emotions]]?
- 

This note is the beginning of an attempt to draw together several trains of thought including:

- [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]
- [[authentic movement]]
- [[interoception glossary]]
- [[the lived body and embodiment]]
- various notes and ideas surrounding embodiment with [[whole physical body minus the brain]] and [[dance and embodiment]] being good places to start (with the latter containing potentially useful legacy information)
- flow -- large body of work here, but Barbara Montero's work is essential



- [[meta-awareness in dance improvisation]]
- [[the degree of immersion in activity]]
- [[interoception science overview]]
- [[focal things and engagement]]
- [[five stages of development of body awareness]]
- [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]
- [[the present is usually illegible to itself]]
- social dancing? interoception and NDA.

## notes from bid writing sprint (April 2023)

- losing one's self:
	+ flow (sport), peak experience, consiousness-as-such (Metzinger), ego-less experiences, non-dual awareness, and minimal phenomenal experiences (episodes of greatly reduced or even absent phenomenal content) akin to full absorption states. 
	+ characterised by sense of 'losing one's self in the activity
	+ MPE: two views that are conflated [@josipovic-2020-nondual n.pag.] - [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]
	+ dmn - active when at rest; see [[interoception glossary]] and [[AIDAN LYON - What Is Meditation, and Why Should You Do It]]

- in sport, this state is highly sort after (associated with peak performance) but mostly occurs seemingly by chance. See Jackson and Csikszentmihalyi 1999

- claims

- methodological issues 

- interoception as anchor

  

  

- John Teasdale mindfulness
- Phil Barnard
- Elsa Urmston -- CI -- flow
- Frank Pollack -- prof in cog neuroscience .. 
- authority. CogNo Clara?? Plymouth. flow in dancers. Teoma mentioned this
- Tony Steffert - [www.qeeg.co.uk](http://www.qeeg.co.uk)


- Compare with daydreaming -- this is talking about NDA in improv. Like aware day dreaming.

- extremely human activities: gossip, argue, playing games, travelling for pleasure and dance
- further evidence of fundamental nature. 
- kinds of dancing: mostly social 
- photographing that which cannot be photographed -- like an artistic component? low-resolution

## output strategies and possibilities

- use of gifs here <https://stimming.me/>
- video essay
- multi-camera setup?? (like Naccarato)
