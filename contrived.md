# contrived

I studied art at high school. My art teacher in the 5th form (when I 15 years old) was a horrible human being: he was condescending, and he shamed and ridiculed us. I struggled in his class, perhaps partly out of what was really psychological abuse, but mostly because I wasn't really busy with practicing art – it was not something I did regularly and with purpose. I saved that space for [playing and thinking about tennis](https://mailchi.mp/c9d358c3419f/making-tennis-something-different).

For one assignment I put a lot of time into a small painting. I remember the colours, the forms. I was proud of how I thought it represented something more than itself. 

The teacher dismissed it as being contrived. 

At the time I didn't know what _contrived_ meant but I learned the lesson quickly that art should never be contrived. Contrived art was right up there with pretentious art.

I'm currently nearing the end of a creative process with the choreographers [Igor and Moreno](https://igorandmoreno.com/). We've worked together a long time now (perhaps 12 years) and just yesterday we spent 1-2 hours trying to decide whether a certain visual component strengthened the work or not. We tried multiple versions, tested it this way and that, and remained open and playful. We still don't know whether to include it and what's more it's not so clear how we ought to decide: intuition? Pros and cons? A coin toss? The I Ching?

What is peculiar is that I'm still not quite sure how to make sense of all the decisions that go into making something and the appearance of that something as being contrived or not. Isn't all art contrived to a greater or lesser extent? The most improvised work I've been involved in has been anything but indeterminate: why were we dancing in _that_ way and not in another way? Wasn't I making decisions all the time under the pretence of anything-can-happen? 

Where then is the line between an intuitive, surprising and less 'touched' work of art and one that is contrived? My assumption is that it has to do less with how and what decisions are made, but rather how much space the work offers the imaginations of its audience. The more I attempt to take care of all the _entries_ and _exits_ to the artwork, the less space there is for the intelligence, curiosity, memories and experiences of the viewer.

In 1995 I saw a performance by David Dorfman Dance in the US. At the time my father [Ian Graham Ellis](https://www.skellis.net/blog/ige) was very sick with cancer (he died at the end of that year). While I was watching the work (the name of which I can't remember, but it was a duet that included a saxophone!) I was astounded to realise that Dorfman had made a work about the impending death of my father. How could that possibly be? 

It was of course the least surprising thing to all of a sudden understand that when we make something, we never know what it is that a viewer will bring to that work. Marcel Duchamp said that an artist only does 50% of the work and that the remainder is done by the viewer. This is also known as [the beholder's share](https://aeon.co/videos/on-the-beholders-share-how-past-experience-influences-our-perception-of-art). There's tremendous humility is recognising this share, and perhaps it also offers a certain amount of freedom or calm as an artist. It is as if to say, "Here, I'll place these things on this table for you the audience to rearrange and make sense of as your memory and imagination choose."

Perhaps the real mistake I made in that little painting I painted back in 1984 was that I thought I could account for all the ways it might function. If only that art teacher had had the capacity (and perhaps humility) to enter that kind of conversation.
