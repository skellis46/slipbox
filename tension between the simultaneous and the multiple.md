# tension between the simultaneous and the multiple

_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

> Thus while simultaneity is often understood as a reduction of that multiplicity, creating a singular time beholden to capital, the present is actually animated by a tension between the simultaneous and the multiple, variously contracting and protracting a sense of contemporaneity in which times conjoin.[@burges-2016-introduction p.3]

> Roger Luckhurst and Peter Marks suggest that “the difference at the heart of the ‘now’ can be seen as a *constitutive* and *productive* heterogeneity, a circulation of multiple times within the single instant. We might take this to be what the ‘contemporary,’ *con-temporarius*, literally suggests: ‘joined times’ or ‘times together.’”6 [@burges-2016-introduction p.4]

- this last citation is from Roger Luckhurst and Peter Marks, “Hurry Up Please It’s Time: Introducing the Contemporary,” in Literature and the Contemporary: Fictions and Theories of the Present, ed. Roger Luckhurst and Peter Marks (New York: Longman, 1999), 3.
- love the sense of the tension that Burges and Elias describe. Not sure this theorization is so useful to the pragmatics of the project for [[footfall]] but might be useful in how I frame it (and if I frame it)
