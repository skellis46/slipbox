# breaking off the human from its sustaining conditions

_previous note:_ [[the body in the Anthropocene]]

> [W]e have to rethink the human in light of precarity, showing that there is no human without those networks of life within which human life is but one sort of life. Otherwise, we end up breaking off the human from all of its sustaining conditions (and in that way become complicit with the process of precaritization itself).

-- Judith Butler, [in @kloetzel-2017-site p.120]
