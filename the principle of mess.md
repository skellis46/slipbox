# the principle of mess

_previous note:_ [[the many practices of practice research]]

In May I did a presentation called The Many Practices of Practice Research. In it I proposed 9 principles of practice research and I thought I'd share them here one at a time. The first is called the principle of mess.

We normally associate research processes with words like methodical and rigorous, and most certainly we do not think of research as _ad hoc_.

In _The Mangle of Practice_ (1995) the sociologist and historian of science Andrew Pickering describes the practice of science as an unpredictable "dance of agency" (Pickering 1995: 21). Pickering's goal was to make a case that scientific practice represents a "dialectic of resistance and accommodation" (Pickering 1995: 22-23) and that it is overwhelmingly ad hoc.

Something ad hoc is makeshift; an emergency; it is improvised, impromptu and expedient, It is to "practise or create by using ad hoc measures, […] to assemble or organize chaotically" (noauthor 2021).

To work in an ad hoc way in artistic practice -- as it is in science -- is a strength, not a weakness. This is the principle of mess. The principle of mess does not discount the importance of methods and rigour. Rather, it brings mess (or practicing in an ad hoc way) into a dialectic with rigour.
