# making tennis something different

The American tennis player Jimmy Connors was in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s. He was known as being brash and he introduced fist-pumping into tennis long before fist-pumping was the go-to gesture for all athletes.

I recently happened across this gem of Connors -- [courtesy of the design blogger Tina Roth Eisenberg (also known as Swissmiss)](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2021/08/link-pack-96.html) -- from 1996 when he was playing on the _senior_ tour as an _elderly_ 44 year old.

In the clip, Connors has a problem – a problem he will have experienced many thousands of times in his career. His solution to the problem is not ideal (i.e. it has an unlikely chance of success) but it does represent one of several options available to him, even if it is not using the racket according to the instructions on the packet.[^legal]

The clip reminded me of a famous (and brief) 1968 essay by Alexandra Calandra called [_Angels on a Pin_](https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/raman/FunPhysics/Parable.htm), and also known as the [Barometer Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometer_question). In it a physics student is asked the following question: "How would you determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer?" The student answers as follows: "Take the barometer to the top of the building, attach a long rope to it, lower the barometer to the street and then bring it up, measuring the length of the rope. The length of the rope is the height of the building." The student's response is correct but is not calculated in the conventional way that the teacher had planned or was expecting. The student is also able to provide many many different answers -- all correct -- none of which employ a barometer as it is designed to be used. Aside from messing with the teacher, it is as if the student was working both inside and outside of the conventions of the subject. That is, he provides several unconventional, but accurate, solutions to the problem.

Connors did the same thing in the video above; he found an unconventional solution to an everyday tennis problem. I like to think that the racket become an alternate device while still remaining a tennis racket. Connors stretched how we might come to understand the role -- and perhaps value -- of a tennis racket.  

What could this have to do with dance and choreography? 

I've mentioned the philosopher Alva Noë in a [previous newsletter called Choreography as a hammer](https://mailchi.mp/533ec5858e5b/tdkyqsgow4-4771458) and I'd like to use his thinking again here. Noë writes in _Strange Tools_ (2015) that a work of art is an implement or instrument that has been denuded of its function."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.] He compares art to design. Whereas design's role is to fall into the background art pulls itself into the foreground. Noë uses dance as another example. He suggests that the art of dance (choreography) "has nothing to do with dancing". He thinks that choreography uses the familiar aspects of social dancing and "manipulates and obscures these; it makes art out of these. Choreography, in a sense, is the interruption (or subversion) of dancing."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.]

I think Jimmy Connors did something to his tennis racket that day in 1996. I think he pulled it into the foreground and -- although the situation still had everything to do with tennis -- for just a moment he made tennis something different, something less recognisable. He subverted the dance and made it choreography.

By the way, [here's Rafael Nadal trying a similar shot (but failing) in 2017](https://youtu.be/5CQIqXsiyK4).
      
[^legal]: Apparently his was a legal _shot_ in those days, as long as the player catches the racket afterwards. At some stage since 1996 the rules were changed such that a player must have control of the racket in order to play a legal shot. Boo tennis.

Next month: trying to make sense of interpretive dance.
