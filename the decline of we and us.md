# the decline of we and us

_previous note:_ [[to define the meaning of we]]

The freelance writer Ari David Blaff -- in this case writing for the libertarian-leaning (and space that criticises left-wing orthodoxy) publication Quillette -- discusses the _exhibitionist economy_. He cites (directly from the Abstract, as I have done below) [research by Twenge et al (2012)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022112455100) that examined popular cultural products from between 1960 and 2008 and found:

> the use of first person plural pronouns (e.g., we, us) decreased 10% first person singular pronouns (I, me) increased 42%, and second person pronouns (you, your) quadrupled. These results complement previous research finding increases in individualistic traits among Americans.[Twenge, in @blaff-2021-exhibitionist n.pag.]
