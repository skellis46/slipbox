# mirror with phone

_previous note:_ 

idea of using a mirror with phone -- some kind of combination. (from the film in [Eliasson's resource section](https://olafureliasson.net/inrealliferesources/) -- a film by Natasha Mendonca called [Movements are facts](https://www.soe.tv/videos/movements-are-facts-excerpt)) — from Eliasson exhibition all those years ago (13 August 2019). Links to some of images I took at the exhibition are at [[olafur eliasson images]]. Could plausibly link to [[losing one's self]]. For example, this morning (19 September 2023) I happened to see myself in my phone as the bedside light was slowly warming up. This is the photo:

There's something about that kind of light (very Viola) in which the body disappears into the background.
