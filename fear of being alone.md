# fear of being alone

_previous note:_ [[Turkle - The Empathy Diaries]]

> The first step in spending time alone is to admit how afraid of it we are.

> To be alone for any length of time is to shed an outer skin. The body is inhabited in a different way when we are alone than when we are with others. Alone, we live in our bodies as a question rather than a statement.[@whyte-2019-consolations n.pag.]
