# the body from the inside

_previous note:_ [[an object of special regard]]

Dear

My colleagues and I at the [Centre for Dance Research in Coventry](http://c-dare.co.uk/) spend quite a lot of energy [discussing what the word embodiment means](https://soundcloud.com/user-235484908/sets/inventing-embodiment), and what it means to be embodied. I suspect you can imagine that such things matter for a group of people whose curiosity and livelihoods depend on foregrounding the importance of the body to experience. 

But we are not the only ones. 

Neuroscientists now make a strong case that our sense of self or "conscious selfhood" is built on "experiences of having a body, and of 'being a body'" (Seth & Tsakiris 2018 p.969). The business anthropologist Simon Roberts' 2020 book _The Power of Not Thinking: How Our Bodies Learn and Why We Should Trust Them_ covers much of this work (as does Annie Murphy Paul's _The Extended Mind: The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain_ (2021), much of which is built on the research of Andy Clark). As a brief aside, Roberts' book has recently been published in Italian under the title _L'intelligenza del corpo: Che cosa sa il nostro corpo che noi non sappiamo_ (_The intelligence of the body: what our body knows that we do not know_) -- a much more direct but perhaps less enticing title for native English speaking business people). 

_Being a body_ is, of course, a [recurring theme](https://mailchi.mp/5c1c842181e5/an-object-of-special-regard) in these short essays. I wonder though if there is a clear link between many of the somatic practices that are common in Western contemporary dance, and this broader importance of body-based experiences and understandings in how we live our lives. 

"What the hell is a somatic practice?" I hear you ask. Quite.

A somatic practice is any body-based practice that foregrounds the body as it is felt from the inside. Nearly all dance practices do this, but some more than others. Classical ballet, for instance, has a well-known obsession (think Darren Aronofsky's 2010 film _Black Swan_ ;-)) for how the body is seen from the outside. The presence of mirrors in ballet studios is also a dead giveaway. 

But for those of us deeply immersed in sensing the body as it feels from the inside, it's easy to forget just how radical that proposition is. Here the American vipassana (insight-based meditation) teacher Joseph Goldstein [describes his epiphany during a walking meditation](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/C2BA6D): 

>  Instead of watching the movement or observing the movement, it was simply to feel the movement, to feel the sensations of the movement. And in the feeling language, that's from the inside. 

Goldstein goes on to say how meditation often uses "watching language" -- watch, notice, observe, note -- that stresses the idea that 'we' are in the head/brain (located somewhere behind our eyes) observing our bodies from above. Such a topology of bodily experience has a tight hold on being human despite scientific and experiential evidence to the contrary. It remains difficult to imagine that the concept of a self is no more than a loosely cobbled together collection of direct corporeal experiences that is far more illusory, and far less tangible than we mostly care to imagine. The ninth-century Indian philosopher Śāntideva described how this conviction that we are selves arises from our fear of death, and that "we construct the idea of a self as a bulwark against that fear" (Garfield, 2022)

This is all a very roundabout way to let you know that I am in the middle of a research project called [Losing Oneself](https://losingoneself.coventry.ac.uk/) that uses experiences of movement improvisation and somatic practices to explore consciousness, body awareness, nonduality and mindfulness. If this is your thing you can [sign-up here](https://losingoneself.coventry.ac.uk/subscribe/) to receive a weekly digest of new content on the site. 

Thanks for reading and next month I promise to not mention embodiment.
