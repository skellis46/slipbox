# Hitchens' epistemological razor

_previous note:_ [[somatics unlimited]]

A philosophical razor is a rule of thumb designed to shave off unlikely explanations of phenomena; a time-saving device. Hitchens' epistemological razor is designed to reject certain knowledge claims. It was created by and named after renowned journalist and atheist Christopher Hitchens: 

> What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. [@hitchens-2007-god p.258]

Hitchens was using the razor in the context of refuting religious belief, but what it does more broadly is put the burden of proof on the person making the claim. For example, if I claim that somatic practices improve physical coordination, then it is my responsibility to try and provide the evidence to build that argument.
