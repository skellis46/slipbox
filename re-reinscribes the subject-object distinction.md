# re-reinscribes the subject-object distinction

_previous note:_ [[body being known]]

> ... it is a recipe for irresolvable moral conflict, as each of us has our moral demands specified by our particular version of the moral landscape. Morality, as Rawls so eloquently emphasizes, demands common assent.
> Nonetheless, despite the manifest absurdity of this vision of the moral universe, it is—at least implicitly, if rarely explicitly—widely shared. We appeal to this version of moral geography every time we prefer our own interests over those of others, and every time we decide that someone is not worthy of our consideration because they fall into an out-group, or because they have in some way harmed us. We do so when we take it to be natural for me to prefer the interests of my family to those of yours. When we take these attitudes for granted as justifiable, we implicitly relativize our moral judgments to our own situation; we center ourselves in the moral universe.
> This common, even instinctive, tendency is the moral counterpart and consequence of the view that we are selves. This is because it re-reinscribes the subject-object distinction that originates as an account of our cognitive relation to the world, but this time as an account of our ethical relation to the world. To see everything through the subject-object lens is to see oneself as subject and agent, and everyone else as moral objects and as patients. Only this instinctive attitude can provide any motivation at all for this way of thinking about ethical life. And this is one more problem with the attitude that we are selves. When we ascribe that kind of independence, separation from the world in which we act, and immediate intimacy to ourselves, it is a very short step to moral egoism. [@garfield-2022-losing Chapter 7 Ethics: Abandon the Self to Abandon Egoism, n.pag.]

This shift from cognitive to ethical relation to the world is extraordinary. The question of how now to centre one's self in the moral universe is powerful. To not have a self is a way to undermine this tendency?
