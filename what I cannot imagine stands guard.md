_previous note:_ [[epistemic humility]]

>I close with Spivak’s (1993) caution that “what I cannot imagine stands guard over everything that I must/can do, think, live” (p. 22). That warning has stayed with me for over twenty years, haunting my brief and personal history in post inquiry.[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.16]
