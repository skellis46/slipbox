# the circulation of oxygen

This was edited out of pressure time keynote.

> Suzuki recognizes that seeing humans as interdependent with the living world lies at the heart of the seventh-generation principle. The environment is not something “out there”; as he puts it, “we are the environment.” We are connected to the landscape, just as we are to future generations, through the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil in which we grow our food.
> The oxygen we breathe in, for instance, circulates in our blood-stream and around half remains in our lungs, so there is no clear line separating where the air ends and we begin. When we exhale, our breath mixes with the air and is taken in by other people, birds, mammals, and reptiles. “If I am air and you are air, then I am you,” writes Suzuki. But the atoms in the air also persist through time. According to one study, there are 3 x 1019 (three followed by nineteen zeros) argon atoms in a breath of air. These quintillions of atoms are continually being blown around the planet, so wherever you are, you will breathe in around 15 argon atoms that you breathed in a year earlier. And that’s not all. Each breath we take contains argon atoms that were probably once inhaled by Cleopatra and Gautama Buddha, and will be breathed in by our descendants seven generations from today. “Air,” says Suzuki, plays an essential role “linking all life in a single matrix, and joining past, present and future in a single flowing entity.”32 [@krznaric-2021-good p.88]
