# boundaries and transgressions


Saarnivaara cites her own work 'The boundary within me. Reflections on the difficulty of transgression' and wonders "why boundaries are so important or so strongly associated with anxiety."[@saarnivaara-2003-art p.589] Her writing simply made me think about borders, boundaries and what is crossed when we transgress something.

_thoughts & links:_

- [[a border is not a boundary]]
- I wonder if the transgression of a border is more difficult (emotionally, physically, etc) than transgressing a boundary. The relative fuzziness of a border -- the relative lack of clarity -- might make it more destabilising.
- perhaps thinking re [[the Dao of butchering cows]] is useful re transgression of the body (with a knife). That there are margins in the body that are more akin to a border than a boundary. Sites of intermingling that ask the butcher to slow down; they are sites of the Dao (and not Qi and technics)
