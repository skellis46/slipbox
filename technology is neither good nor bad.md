# technology is neither good nor bad

>Kranzberg's First Law reads as follows: Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.[@kranzberg-1986-technology p.545]

>By that I mean that technology's interaction with the social ecology is such that technical developments frequently have environmental, social, and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves, and the same technology can have quite different results when introduced into different contexts or under different circumstances.[@kranzberg-1986-technology pp.545-546]

>The point is that the same technology can answer questions differently, depending on the context into which it is introduced and the problem it is designed to solve.[@kranzberg-1986-technology p.546]
