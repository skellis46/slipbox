# iteration

_previous note:_ [[hermeneutic circle]]

Walter L. Wallace described the _wheel of science_ in 1971. It has plenty of variations but it's more or less this:

(stolen from Brené Brown's _Atlas of the Heart_)

I really like how simple and elegant the model it is. It conveys an enormous number of ideas, assumptions, and perhaps even ideologies.

I thought I'd try and make a version useful for people working through practice-research. It's not quite as pretty as Brené Brown's but I guarantee she didn't do it herself.

I understand this iterative relationship between one's practice and the community of practice to be at the heart of artistic research: to be circling outwards and inwards, outwards and inwards. 

Some other thoughts: 

- There is also no clear starting point or sense that one is following a linear progression or set of protocols.
- I was less certain about what to place along the sides and perhaps could have just let them be empty. I avoided _refraction_ because I am so allergic to academic fashions, not because I don't think it's a useful idea.
- Should I try and include the role of writing? 
- There is no place for _outputs_ in this model

Any thoughts?
