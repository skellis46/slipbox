# dancing as organised activity

_previous note:_ [[noë - strange tools]]

---

Noë understands that humans are organised by habitual _scripted_ activities, while at the same time we don't follow a script. This seems to be the central paradox of the book: we are organised, and we organise. He sees dancing as a paradigmatic example of an organised activity.

It is a natural and spontaneous response to music, rhythm or movement. It also demands attention and perceptual sensitivity to what we hear, our movement and the movement of others. 

>Dancing is exquisitely complex cognitively and perceptually, but for all that it is also basic, natural, and spontaneous. It also has a point or purpose depending on the person and circumstances.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 2 Reorganizing Ourselves, n.p.]

The organisational paradox in dance is that we choose to dance. It is a purposeful activity. But for Noë we "don't decide how to dance" [@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 2 Reorganizing Ourselves, n.p.] when we think of it at the level of being swept up into the heart of the dancing:

>The dancing just happens. One dancer may “lead,” but this is just a special way of letting oneself be caught up in the dance. A good dancer is in the flow. When two people dance, their movements and actions and thoughts and perceptions are entrained by the larger organization, the dancing itself.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 2 Reorganizing Ourselves, n.p.]

- this continues my deepening curiosity about social dancing (even if by one's self)
