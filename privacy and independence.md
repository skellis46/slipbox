# privacy and independence 

> Privacy is a fairly modern construct that emerged along with notions of individuality, personal liberty, and independence [5]. When public discourse entered the stage of history, one had to create an autonomous inner space to ideate private thoughts and opinions that could, subsequently, lead to publically arguing, questioning, debating, and advocating for change. Thus, privacy was necessary to enjoy freedom of thought. In Medieval Europe the notion of privacy became a peculiar paradox. Theologians conceived a notion of individual conscience—an autonomous faculty to discern between right and wrong. Yet, the Church developed an elaborate spiritual apparatus to shape, control, and punish “the private” through confession, internalized guilt, taxonomy of sins, and a vision of constant, and direct, divine surveillance. During the Reformation, with the great aid of the printing press, subversive literature inspired the germination of ideas that questioned the very foundations of feudal order and authority. This ultimately brought about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.

> Most importantly, as David Brooks rightfully articulates, privacy is critical in the “development of full individuals because there has to be an interior zone within each person that other people don’t see” or approve of . In this internal zone “half-formed thoughts and delicate emotions can grow and evolve, without being exposed to the harsh glare of public judgment” and condemnation. In this inner space we can be free to develop ideas, often subversive or even dangerous, and convictions away from the pressure to conform. It is a spot where “you are only yourself and can define yourself” [6]. In its very essence, this private, internal zone made us who we are; it shaped our humanity and allowed intellectual growth and creativity to flourish. It fostered experimentation with ideas without social judgment and ostracism. This notion of privacy is deeply related to intimacy and freedom of thought [7–10].

> By making our actions and shares visible to a crowd, social media exposes us to a kind of virtual Panopticon. Self-surveillance and, consequently, the oppression it brings about are direct results of these cyber tools. “There are no guards and no prisoners in Facebook’s virtual Panopticon. We are both guards and prisoners, watching and implicitly judging one another as we share content” [12].
