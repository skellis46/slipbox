Dear 

This month I'm continuing my rather shallow dive into the science of embodiment ... 

[Last time I mentioned how the rubber hand illusion](https://mailchi.mp/b07907640417/rubber-hands-and-illusions-part-1) is described as being the basis of scientific research into embodiment. 

Not surprisingly, scientists have developed an augmented reality version of the RHI protocol in which a virtual rubber hand is superimposed within the participant's visual field. In this case the virtual rubber hand would be more realistically like the actual hand of the participant (rather than, well, a rubber-looking rubber hand). [Suzuki and colleagues](https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23993906) even state that an AR-based RHI design "assesses the extent to which participants feel embodied in their own body ... as compared to the classical RHI which assesses susceptibility to incorporation of foreign bodies or body parts within the body image." (People are generally not shy about overstatement when it comes to AR and VR).

In 2016 [Škola & Liarokapis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-016-1246-8) compared AR, VR and traditional versions of the RHI and found that the traditional (rubber-looking rubber) version of the RHI elicited the strongest illusion. But, the AR and VR versions did give similar neural patterns as the traditional version _and_ a significant sense of body ownership. 

I can almost hear you asking, "What the hell you telling me this shit for Simon?"

Hang in there. 

I've written about interoception [previously](https://mailchi.mp/eaf7275152b4/correlating-our-insides). Here I'll quote myself quoting others (like a rubbish academic):

> Interoceptive body awareness is the perception of our internal state and provides "a sense of the physiological condition of the entire body"[^2] and "a representation of the feeling self that seems to differentiate humans from non-human primates."[^craig2] In other words, the human sense of self is underpinned by interoceptive body awareness.[^damasio]

[^damasio]: If you are interested in more on this I recommend Antonio Damasio's 2021 book _Feeling & Knowing: Making Minds Conscious_.

The crudest of crude measures of interoception is the capacity to accurately sense one's own heartbeat. And one of the things that Suzuki et al did – and this is made possible by an AR version of the RHI design – is that they synchronised the exteroceptive (external) stimulus of the AR rubber hand being brushed with the participants' heartbeats. 

Now that is very cool. 

And what did they find?

Scientists had already figured out that people with higher interoceptive sensitivity – that is, those who are better able to sense their own heartbeats – are _less_ susceptible to the RHI. That is, if you are better at sensing your body from the inside, you are less likely to feel the rubber-hand as a part of your body. Strong internal bodily awareness anchors the sense of self.

What Suzuki and his colleagues found is that subjective and objective measures of virtual-hand ownership are strengthened by cardio-visual feedback in time with the heartbeat. I know right? When we are given information that sensitises us to our heartbeats our experiences of body ownership are enhanced. 

Which brings me to the point of this brief essay ...

None of this will be surprising to dancers.
