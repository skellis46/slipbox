> Taking this idea further it could be argued that our paradigm assesses the extent to which participants feel embodied in their own body (albeit with conﬂicting proprioceptive signals), as compared to the classical RHI which assesses susceptibility to incorporation of foreign bodies or body parts within the body image. (Suzuki)

[[out of body experiences]]?? 

  

"Later in the Guide, I will explain ways to interact with your sensations, such as via labelling or by reappraising them, but first it’s important to practise disidentifying from sensation, to have that buffer of nonjudgment in place." (Psyche, How to Trust Your Body)

  

"During both unreflective everyday experience (walking the dog, watching the rain fall, daydreaming, etc.) and more constrained mental activity (self-conscious reflection, attentive concentration, etc.), the dynamical aspect of our conscious experience is pervasive and unavoidable. Whether we are startled by a unique and surprising event, such as a thunder clap, or we are following the ongoing train of ideas during a lecture, our experience seems always to be on the move. Yet we can recognize not only an ongoing movement or flow, but also a certain standing now or present moment, which seems always there—or rather *here*—invariant throughout the flow. These two structural features of our experience—a standing now and an ongoing flow—are central to both [James, 1981]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib40](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib40)), [Husserl, 1991]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib36)) analyses of consciousness.[1]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#fn1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#fn1)) According to [Husserl (1991)]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib36)), they form one unified phenomenal structure, which he calls the standing-streaming structure of time-consciousness (see [Zahavi, 2003]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib91](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib91)), [Zahavi, 2005]([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib92](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810007000694?via%3Dihub#bib92))). To set forth a phenomenological framework for our treatment of binocular rivalry in this paper, let us highlight a few basic features of this phenomenal structure."
