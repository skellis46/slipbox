> And so when we think of ourselves as loopy creatures, we can kind of create those loops where we’re passing information and ideas in and out of these different domains — the body, spaces, other people’s minds — and then back through our own heads. And that’s a much more fertile and generative way of dealing with information than just always keeping it inside our own heads where it’s not going to be changed or altered or improved in any way. Murphy Paul

> One of the pieces of this that I just want to make sure we touch on before we leave this section of the conversation is, and this is not going to sound like a big deal before I say it, so I implore the audience to think of it as a big deal, that sitting still imposes a greater cognitive burden on the brain than standing or walking. And I think that sounds normal enough, and then you realize how much time and energy and social structure and public money has gone into trying to get us to sit still most of the time. And it actually seems quite crazy. So could you talk about that finding? - Klein

> Well, the first is “Supersizing the Mind” by Andy Clark. He’s the originator of the extended mind theory. And although he’s an ivory tower philosopher, he writes like a dream. He’s so funny and clever, and I really enjoy his writing always. The second is “Mind in Motion” by Barbara Tversky. She’s a professor at Teachers College in New York. And that’s about how the body affects the way the mind operates, and it’s just a great primer on embodied cognition. 

> And then the third one, I thought it was going to be kind of a wild card out from left field, but actually we touched on it quite explicitly during this conversation, Ezra. It’s “Thoughts Without a Thinker” by Mark Epstein, who is a psychiatrist who practices Western psychotherapy but also is a scholar of Buddhism and integrates the two. And you were saying in our conversation earlier today, who is the one who’s thinking? Who is the person who’s having these thoughts? I really think Mark Epstein takes on those questions in a really interesting way. Murphy Paul
