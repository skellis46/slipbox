# unhistoric acts and a hidden life

_previous note:_ [[the difference between hope and optimism]]

Matlock quotes directly from the novel Middlemarch by George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans):

> For the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.[Eliot, in @matlock-2022-how]

- linking to [[footfall]], but not quite sure why. I think it's about tombs or perhaps a simple image of a shovel and a shallow grave.
