# the singular structuring of capitalist time

_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

>  Is it possible that some cultures or bodies themselves resist incorporation into capitalist time? Is it possible that capitalist time itself produces or calls forth obstinacies in the form of times that chafe against its relentlessly singular structuring of our days? Is it possible that temporality itself might be something that always eludes complete cooptation by capital, something on a different categorical or ontological level leading to multiple fractures and sites of resistance within (or outside of) that very system? [@burges-2016-introduction p.12]

- [[footfall]] - multiple fractures is a useful term; as is 'obstinacies'
