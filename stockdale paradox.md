# stockdale paradox

_previous note:_ [[questioning our beliefs]]

---

The author and researcher Jim Collins coined the term the Stockdale Paradox after interviewing US Vietnam War POW James Stockdale. 

Stockdale responded to Collins' question about which prisoners didn't make it out of Vietnam by saying "the optimists". He then said:

>You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end—which you can never afford to lose—with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be.[@noauthor-2021-stockdale]

In this writing and _philosophy of business leadership_, Collins describes the key concept of Disciplined Thought. One of these disciplines is to [confront the brutal facts](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/confront-the-brutal-facts.html)

- I remain intrigued by what 'reality' might be in the world of dance research
- [[the map is not the territory]] as distinct from [[search for truth]]
- what is there? What am I making up (and why am I making it up?) See Godin note on dancing with belief:
