# an interface is always an effect

_previous note:_ [[touch exposes us to the world]]

Alexander R. Galloway's book _The Interface Effect_ is about thresholds -- "those mysterious zones of interaction that mediate between different realities".[@galloway_interface_2012 p.vii] It is about computers, screens, peripherals and all the other things that seem to be part of our digital lives, and "none of these things in particular."[@galloway_interface_2012 p.vii]

He is "sympathetic"[@galloway_interface_2012 p.63] to the idea that computers are not solely optical or visual devices (e.g. within "visual culture"); that we should not conflate the interface of a computer with the computer itself as this would be to ignore clearly non-visual aspects like “nonoptical interfaces (keyboard, mouse, controller, sensor); data in memory and data on disk; executable algorithms; networking technologies and protocols ..."[@galloway_interface_2012 p.64] 

An interface, for Galloway, is "not a thing, an interface is always an effect. It is always a process or a translation."[@galloway_interface_2012 p.33].  An interface is a "practice of mediation."[@galloway_interface_2012 p.16]
