# paradox of loss of self while high awareness while improvising

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

This is the key paradox really. Sense of loss of self as in [[nondual awareness]] but with high [[task positive network]] and sense of awareness. This is happening to me. Not sure below quote is the best (there are others from [[Garfield - Losing Ourselves]]) -- for instance [[distinguishing ego-involved and ego-less experiences]] -- but it's a start.
