# the paradox of the body

_previous note:_ 

In [[What are we calling the self?]] Joseph Goldstein maps out just how easy it is to identify with our body. The paradox is experienced as the lucid concreteness of direct experiences in the body (temperature, movement, tingling, pressure, etc), and how we concatenate and identify these direct experiences as belonging to the abstract concept of a self connected to a body that is *mine*. 

Goldstein says:

> When we're not looking deeply into our experience, into the nature of our experience, and simply live in the world of surface appearances, what happens is, we create a reference point for all experience, a someone to whom all experience is happening. We're creating this notion of a self behind experience to whom it's happening. How much of our sense of self comes from a superficial perception of the body? No, it seems so solid. And it's the first, you know, who are you? This is me, it was so easy to identify with the body as being self. 

For dancers (and other practitioners) honing the body as the primary lens to filter experience I imagine it is difficult to reconcile the concreteness of direct experience with the creation and reinforcement of a 'self behind experience'. Two things occur to me: i) would anything be different if we (as dancers) no longer clung to that which we call a self? ii) is the body as perceived by dancers simply a bias through which we enter the adventure of consciousness?

Rupert Spira writes something that relates to this idea:

> If we think that we know something objective about ourselves or the world, then whatever that something is that we think we know, will condition our subsequent enquiry into the nature of experience.

One hunch I have is that this 'thinking that we know something' as dancers amounts to a kind of bias of training. That is, we come to think of ourselves as knowing the world through the body which in turn conditions our entry into the nature of experience. It's a disturbing thought as it undermines all that we (in dance) tend to think and say about the primacy of corporeal experience. But the thought also accounts for why others not 'trained' in dance can't possibly be conditioned by it. They have other things that condition their enquiry into the nature of experience.
