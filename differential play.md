# unprecedented events and differential play

He describes how _unprecedented events_ are created -- or "registered" -- by experimental systems which are themselves "material systems of differential play":[@schwab_experimental_2019 p.163]

>So what about an epistemic thing’s temporal structure? To answer the question, it is important to remember that an epistemic thing is not a material object but an event emergent from the differential play of the experimental system and its resultant traces or graphemes, as Rheinberger prefers to call them. In effect, the event isn’t first of all an abrupt rupture in the fabric of knowledge, although it may be retrospectively narrated as such (Rheinberger 2013, 203). Rather, traces have to resonate (Rheinberger 1997, 65) and come together within the different spaces of representation employed in the system as well as in its temporal structure. The event has to be multiple, that is, recurrent, since this is how difference is registered in time. Still, without such a coming together, there is no event and no epistemic thing.

- [ ] I need to go to [original Rheinberger here (1997)]([rheinberger-1997-toward.pdf](hook://file/y8Mh90OXa?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=rheinberger-1997-toward.pdf)) to deepen my understanding 

>Crucially, an experimental system ‘plays out its own intrinsic capacities’ the more the experimenter ‘learns to handle his or her experimental system’ (Rheinberger 1997, 24) until it is able to surprise the experimenter with its own characteristics, unanticipated by the system’s creator, in what Rheinberger calls ‘unprecedented events’ (Rheinberger 1997, 133).[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.122]
