_previous note:_  [[focal activity is a convex lens]]

I have been making a lot of [sourdough bread lately](https://www.mertonbakery.com). Much more than usual. I started on sourdough back in about 2009 and have had some exquisite failures: some didn't make the oven, and too many frisbees to remember came out of the oven. But, as so happens with practice, I got better. 

It occurred to me recently that making bread is a unique process in my life in that I think I could bake bread completely from the ground up -- although growing, harvesting and grinding the wheat would be challenging, perhaps more so than building a clay oven. But with time I reckon I could do it, and I understand the nature of the process already. How many things are there in our lives like that? I make my own yoghurt but I would have no idea how to milk a cow, let alone get the cow into a spot where I could even try. Or working wood into a pencil case after I had felled a tree and prepared the wood? No way. And I can definitely rule out anything that has any plastic in it.

It reminds me of that art project by Thomas Thwaites called [The Toaster Project](https://www.thomasthwaites.com/the-toaster-project/). Perhaps you know of it? Thomas set out to build a toaster from scratch after being inspired by the Douglas Adams quote: "Left to his own devices he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich and that was it." Thwaites has a [Ted talk about the project](https://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_thwaites_how_i_built_a_toaster_from_scratch?) and it's worth a look.

The German-born American philosopher [Albert Borgmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Borgmann) died recently. The idea he is best known for follows on from Martin Heidegger's concept of _Gestell_ (or _enframing_ as it is known in English). In _Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry_ (1984) Borgmann describes two concepts: the device paradigm, and focal things. Borgmann uses an old hearth as an example of a focal thing. A hearth is designed to heat a building, but it also functions as a place for people to gather -- to focus their energy and attention. In contrast, the technology of central heating warms a building and then ... nothing. This is the device paradigm in which the mechanism for the delivery of a commodity (in this case heat) is hidden. For Borgmann, technology becomes synonymous with devices and not the hidden mechanisms. 

The other thing about focal things is that Borgmann suggests they are a burden and take effort. Yet focal things are also practices that give meaning to our lives, and that when developed in scale, become the basis of community and community celebration. Borgmann talks of how focal things are like a convex lens: focal activity gathers ideas, people, and practices together and gently sends them outwards. In such circumstances, the burden of focal practices falls away. 

I think of making [real bread](https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/) like this. It is a focal thing that takes time, care and attention to make. It also strongly symbolic (at least in the West) of being with others. We break bread together.
