# footfall pragmatic practice ideas


## performance ideas and possibilities

- [ ] use soil (or similar?) to create stage or some kind of border or even set of frames (frame within a frame?)


## decided against these

- [ ] can animate set of 9 photos (Ken Burns style?)? 
- [ ] animation of panel falling or tipping out of balance off the screen
- [ ] degrees of predictability: goes from this to this (as if linear). obvious
- [ ] how low can camera go? (check with Titta's tripod?)
