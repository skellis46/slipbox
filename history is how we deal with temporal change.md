# history is how we deal with temporal change

_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

> Jörn Rüsen writes, “History is a specific way in which humans deal with the experience of temporal change. The way they realize it essentially depends upon pre-given or underlying ideas and concepts of time.”53 This implies that history is not philosophy of time per se but rather is built upon time, upon already ensconced cultural understandings of what time is.54 Predicated on time schemas, history is at least two removes from “actual” time, whatever that may be.55 History is not time but a cultural mediation of time, which itself has already been mediated through our cognitive schemas, cultural vocabularies, moral systems, ontologies, and epistemologies (and perhaps even our mathematics, as the quantum revolution has shown).[@burges-2016-introduction p.19]
