# mythical vs technological core of culture

_previous note:_ [[Jacobs - After Technopoly]]

---

In his article for The New Atlantis, Alan Jacobs calls on the work of Polish philsopher Leszek Kołakowski who makes a distinction between the technological and mythical cores of culture. 

Jacobs writes that, according to Kołakowski, technology is:

> a stance toward the world in which we view things around us as objects to be manipulated, or as instruments for manipulating our environment and ourselves.[@jacobs_after_2019 p.3] 

This definition is not necessarily a negative thing, and nor does it only include tools. For instance, Jacobs writes that (some) philosophy and the sciences are technological in that they "are governed by instrumental, analytical forms of reasoning by which we seek some measure of control."[@jacobs_after_2019 p.3]

In contrast, the mythical core of culture is an aspect of experience "not subject to manipulation, because it is prior to our instrumental reasoning about our environment."[p.3] Crucially, any attempt to describe the experience (in any terms, for example will, desire, or meaning) is a way to try and compress or force the mythical core into the technological core.


_questions & thoughts:_

- I'm fascinated by the mythical core, and it feels like opening out towards the concept (and experience) of myth. Jacobs cites his own writing about myth in relation to cancel culture: <https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/wokeness-and-myth-on-campus>

_consider:_

- compare with Noë's understanding of technology: [[technology is skillful activity]]
- Ginot's inclusion of technology in somatic thinking [[somatics, action and technology]]
- [[finger pointing at the moon]]
- [[human experience and language]]
