# The principle of futurity

The principle of futurity recognises that one of practice research's strengths rests on the newness afforded by the many possible futures of artistic practice [@ellis-2021-many]. The principle of futurity is close to what is called speculative or blue-sky research. 

This principle is in direct and productive tension with the principle of truth and limited claims.
