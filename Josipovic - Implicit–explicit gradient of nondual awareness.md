# Josipovic - Implicit–explicit gradient of nondual awareness or consciousness as such

_previous note:_ [[consciousness-as-such]]

## LLM summary 

The article argues that existing two-dimensional models of consciousness—mapping global states and phenomenal content—cannot account for _consciousness as such_ or _nondual awareness_, which is a non-conceptual, self-knowing awareness free from subject–object duality. Josipovic proposes adding a third, _implicit–explicit gradient_ (z-axis) to represent the degree to which nondual awareness is manifest in experience. This awareness can be implicit (hidden within dualistic experience), transitional (partly self-recognised) or explicit (fully self-aware and nondual). Phenomenologically, it unifies perception, cognition and emotion; neurally, it is linked to the central precuneus network integrating self- and world-related processing. Including this gradient clarifies how states such as meditation, psychedelic experience and spontaneous unity experiences differ, and it may help resolve conceptual and neuroscientific impasses by distinguishing consciousness itself from its functions, contents and levels of arousal.

> A caution about language is needed before proceeding. Language is linear, dualistic and temporal, with a subject-object structure, while consciousness as such is experienced as nondual, wholistic and atemporal, so discourse on this topic can easily appear circular and paradoxical, like attempting to describe a three-dimensional (3D) sphere using a one-dimensional line. [@josipovic-2021-implicit p.2]

> The terms consciousness as such and nondual awareness are used interchangeably and stand for the unmodified aspect of conscious experience in itself, a basic non-conceptual nondual awareness, irrespective of the level of arousal or amount of content that may co-occur with it. This is unlike some theories where the term consciousness as such refers only to awareness isolated from all other content (Metzinger 2020). Such awareness is experienced as that which is, and has always been, conscious in all experiences. In other words, as consciousness itself or consciousness as such. [@josipovic-2021-implicit p.2]
