# bibliography - losing one's self - possible key authors and literature review

_previous note:_ [[losing one's self]]

## annotated bibliographies

### keywords: consciousness and dance improvisation

- <https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=dance+improvisation+and+consciousness&btnG=&oq=dance+improvisation+and+consciousnes>
- very common that people do not describe what kind of dancing. Seems to be assumed. 
- general looseness re use of terms (see [[define your terms]])
- any mentions of predictive brain in this work? 

#### Fraleigh, S. (2000) ‘Consciousness Matters’. _Dance Research Journal_ 32 (1), 54–62. Excellent overview of phenomenology of movement and breaking historical dualism. Discussed 1st and 3rd person perspectives. 

> I am concerned for the future of our field that dance research not be dictated
solely by objective distance and quantification.Dance is not a scientific field even if it does employ various sciences to many good purposes. We should not lose the mystery and magic of dance, the anima mundi of our body in its continuity with nature, culture, and community [@fraleigh-2000-consciousness p.55]

- vague, grand statements
- calls on Damasio's core and extended consciousness -- just sort of deploys it
- seems to confuse consciousness with awareness/attention; e.g. "became more adept at moving his consciousness through various bodily states" (p.57)
- no mention of flow but seems to be hinting at optimal experiences ("I feel connected to the natural world in a special way" p.58)
- not at all clear what she means by consciousness (other than passing reference to Damasio) -- other than those things that are appearing?? 

#### Midgelow, V.L. (2015) ‘Improvisation Practices and Dramaturgical Consciousness: A Workshop’. in _Dance Dramaturgy_ [online] ed. by Hansen, P. and Callison, D. London: Palgrave Macmillan UK, 106–123. available from <[http://link.springer.com/10.1057/9781137373229_6](http://link.springer.com/10.1057/9781137373229_6)> [7 September 2023]

- useful overview of improvisation re freedom, but also the idea that we take care of 'dramaturgy' while improvising. But why call it consciousness? What is gained by deploying the word in this way? I think VM is using it as 'awareness'
- cites Fuchs and Gendlin as backbone of her thinking
- very useful reference list regarding dance improvisation
- focus on body memory in improvisation
- very vague re what is 'brought into consciousness' -- that we become aware of things? 
- quotes Fuchs who talks about things being retrieved (from memory). Who is doing the retrieving? And from where? 
> When improvising, for example, movement is released by the body as a form of inattentive recognition and without self-conscious intent [@midgelow-2015-improvisation p.113]
- Released by the body? The body is holding it? What is this body? Then quotes Fuchs again about dualism of pure consciousness. Not clear what's going on here. That the physical body is distinct from consciousness? 

#### Savrami, K. (2017) ‘A Duet between Science and Art: Neural Correlates of Dance Improvisation’. _Research in Dance Education_ 18 (3), 273–290

- little vague but gets into improvisation, enaction and embodied cognition
- but, when gets into the science of movement it is illuminating

### keywords: non-dual awareness and dance improvisation 

- (_and_ nondual -- very different results)
- nondual is perhaps more common because of tendency for so much dance lit to try and get past mind-body split and any other dualism

#### Fraleigh, S. (2017) ‘Back to the Dance Itself: In Three Acts’. _Journal of Dance & Somatic Practices_ 9 (2), 235–253

- notes 'goldmine' re non-dual discourses re lived body research and thinking. 
- "Consciousness is shaped, or we could say ‘intended’, in countless ways" [@fraleigh-2017-back p.235] -- by what? by whom? See that slip? 
- gives list of 'characters' (Feldenkrais etc) at beginning -- love this

> The body, whether still or dancing, is our common bridge to consciousness and states of change. [@fraleigh-2017-back p.237]

- real focus on phenomenology and all the old players in it (Merleau-Ponty, Husserl)
- mentions Damasio on self developing on several levels of consiousness

> Embodied movement does not contain consciousness; it is consciousness in action. Movement is not merely something we do; more, it extends towards expressive activities of relating and remembering – as such, _movement makes meaning_.[@fraleigh-2017-back p.243]

- I'm not sure I understand this at all. What is movement that is embodied? Paid attention to? 
- simple and clear explanation of Varela's work

> When I dance, I lose myself – yield and seize space; I feel more alive. [@fraleigh-2017-back p.249]

There it is! 

> The study of dance as experience not only illuminates consciousness, _as a practice of paying attention, it lights a path towards expanding awareness of self relative to the world and others_. [@fraleigh-2017-back p.249]
- it seems so arbitrary. How does the study of dance do this? And what kinds of dancing? And does she mean the practice of dancing? Does she mean hip-hop? 
- this is a very useful piece of writing but it absolutely does not engage with any recent research, or any surprising research. 
- writes that we can direct consciousness intentionally (p.250) and in that statement I assume she means the choice to be aware of something (to pay attention, p.251) but this is not consciousness. The question of intention and agency seems very important to her
- does feel like it hasn't been edited at all -- so so hard to follow

### bibliography and researchers

- Karla Johanne Shacklock; e.g. [An Investigation into the Nature and Development of Dance Consciousness in Choreography and Performance](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/384/) (2006 PhD thesis), calls her model the _Dance Consciousness Model_. Not still working as an academic.

- large body of work on absorption and flow - but Barbara Montero is the place to start
- Jorge Crecis PhD Thesis (no mention of Montero and no mention of her in PhDs above as well (Shacklock and Douse))

### email out

Dear 

My name is Simon Ellis and I am a scholar at the Centre for Dance Research (C-DaRE) at the University of Coventry. My expertise is in the role of somatic practices (like Feldenkrais, Alexander Technique, and authentic movement) in tuning and enhancing the sensorial experience of the body. In science, practices like these are often named things like body awareness-enhancing therapies, mindful movement practices, movement-based embodied contemplative practices ...

I want to keep this email short so I'll be direct. I'm curious about developing radically transdisciplinary work in which somatic practices might be useful in further understanding the role of interoception in understanding the sense of self. One thought is to host (as a small step) a post-doctoral fellow at C-DaRE -- perhaps through a scheme like the Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship. It's might be a stretch, but I wonder whether this more speculative work might interest you or a like-minded colleague, or perhaps you might even know of an Early Career Researcher who would be interested in the challenge of transdisciplinary work investigating interoception and mindful movement.

Very best wishes, and thanks.

Simon Ellis
