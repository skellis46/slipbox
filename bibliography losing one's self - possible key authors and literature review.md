# bibliography - losing one's self - possible key authors and literature review

_previous note:_ [[losing one's self]]

## annotated bibliography

### consciousness and dance improvisation

- very common that people do not describe what kind of dancing. Seems to be assumed. 
- general looseness re use of terms (see [[define your terms]])
- any mentions of predictive brain in this work? 

#### Fraleigh, S. (2000) ‘Consciousness Matters’. _Dance Research Journal_ 32 (1), 54–62. Excellent overview of phenomenology of movement and breaking historical dualism. Discussed 1st and 3rd person perspectives. 

> I am concerned for the future of our field that dance research not be dictated
solely by objective distance and quantification.Dance is not a scientific field even if it does employ various sciences to many good purposes. We should not lose the mystery and magic of dance, the anima mundi of our body in its continuity with nature, culture, and community [@fraleigh-2000-consciousness p.55]

- vague, grand statements
- calls on Damasio's core and extended consciousness -- just sort of deploys it
- seems to confuse consciousness with awareness/attention; e.g. "became more adept at moving his consciousness through various bodily states" (p.57)
- no mention of flow but seems to be hinting at optimal experiences ("I feel connected to the natural world in a special way" p.58)
- not at all clear what she means by consciousness (other than passing reference to Damasio) -- other than those things that are appearing?? 

#### Midgelow, V.L. (2015) ‘Improvisation Practices and Dramaturgical Consciousness: A Workshop’. in _Dance Dramaturgy_ [online] ed. by Hansen, P. and Callison, D. London: Palgrave Macmillan UK, 106–123. available from <[http://link.springer.com/10.1057/9781137373229_6](http://link.springer.com/10.1057/9781137373229_6)> [7 September 2023]

- useful overview of improvisation re freedom, but also the idea that we take care of 'dramaturgy' while improvising. But why call it consciousness? What is gained by deploying the word in this way? I think VM is using it as 'awareness'
- cites Fuchs and Gendlin as backbone of her thinking
- very useful reference list regarding dance improvisation
- focus on body memory in improvisation
- very vague re what is 'brought into consciousness' -- that we become aware of things? 
- quotes Fuchs who talks about things being retrieved (from memory). Who is doing the retrieving? And from where? 
> When improvising, for example, movement is released by the body as a form of inattentive recognition and without self-conscious intent [@midgelow-2015-improvisation p.113]
- Released by the body? The body is holding it? What is this body? Then quotes Fuchs again about dualism of pure consciousness. Not clear what's going on here. That the physical body is distinct from consciousness? 

#### Savrami, K. (2017) ‘A Duet between Science and Art: Neural Correlates of Dance Improvisation’. _Research in Dance Education_ 18 (3), 273–290

- little vague but gets into improvisation, enaction and embodied cognition
- but, when gets into the science of movement it is illuminating

## bibliography and researchers

- Karla Johanne Shacklock; e.g. [An Investigation into the Nature and Development of Dance Consciousness in Choreography and Performance](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/384/) (2006 PhD thesis), calls her model the _Dance Consciousness Model_. Not still working as an academic.
- Louise Douse, [Moving experience: an investigation of embodied knowledge and technology for reading flow in improvisation](https://uobrep.openrepository.com/handle/10547/346585) (2013 PhD thesis) -- cited the Shacklock PhD
- large body of work on absorption and flow - but Barbara Montero is the place to start
- Jorge Crecis PhD Thesis (no mention of Montero and no mention of her in PhDs above as well (Shacklock and Douse))

### email out

Dear 

My name is Simon Ellis and I am a scholar at the Centre for Dance Research (C-DaRE) at the University of Coventry. My expertise is in the role of somatic practices (like Feldenkrais, Alexander Technique, and authentic movement) in tuning and enhancing the sensorial experience of the body. In science, practices like these are often named things like body awareness-enhancing therapies, mindful movement practices, movement-based embodied contemplative practices ...

I want to keep this email short so I'll be direct. I'm curious about developing radically transdisciplinary work in which somatic practices might be useful in further understanding the role of interoception in understanding the sense of self. One thought is to host (as a small step) a post-doctoral fellow at C-DaRE -- perhaps through a scheme like the Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship. It's might be a stretch, but I wonder whether this more speculative work might interest you or a like-minded colleague, or perhaps you might even know of an Early Career Researcher who would be interested in the challenge of transdisciplinary work investigating interoception and mindful movement.

Very best wishes, and thanks.

Simon Ellis
