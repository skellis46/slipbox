# autotelic

_previous note:_ [[the degree of immersion in activity]]

Someone or something that has a purpose in itself (and not apart from itself). Seems very similar to ideas about [[uselessness and intrinsic value]]. 

Here's Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi:

> An autotelic person needs few material possessions and little entertainment, comfort, power, or fame because so much of what he or she does is already rewarding. Because such persons experience flow in work, in family life, when interacting with people, when eating, even when alone with nothing to do, they depend less on external rewards that keep others motivated to go on with a life of routines. They are more autonomous and independent because they cannot be as easily manipulated with threats or rewards from the outside. At the same time, they are more involved with everything around them because they are fully immersed in the current of life [@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow p.117]
