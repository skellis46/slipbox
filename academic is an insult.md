# academic is an insult


Dieter Lesage is a Belgian philosopher and critic. In 'Who’s Afraid of Artistic Research? On Measuring Artistic Research Output' he outlines the Bologna Process, and in particular the way that process infected the nature of arts practices in the Academy. He described the Bologna process as the "beginning of a fierce battle for the definition of research"[@lesage_whos_2009 p.4]

His hypothesis is that "that the concept of artistic research and the formation of a discourse on artistic research is feared both by groups within the academy and the arts world on the one hand, and by groups within the university and the scientific world on the other hand."[@lesage_whos_2009 p.5]

>As the classic representative institution of higher arts education has often been called an ‘academy’, the question became how to understand the obligation that academies should become academic. By ‘academies’ I will refer to all institutions of higher arts education, whether they teach visual or fine arts or film or drama or music, and whether they are indeed called ‘academy’ or not. Particularly confusing for these ‘academies’ was that many of them had precisely engaged in pedagogical efforts to assure that learning and teaching at ‘academies’ would become less ‘academic’ than it used to be. Whereas at universities, the adjective ‘academic’ sounds like a generic quality label, at academies ‘academic’ had already for quite some time become an insult, a signifier of a lack of artistic quality. And so it happened that, at the very moment that many European academies had become very anxious not to teach their students to produce ‘academic art’, they were told they had to ‘academize’ in order to get accreditations for their artistic study courses.[@lesage_whos_2009 p.4]
