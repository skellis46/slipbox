# zen, map and territory

_previous note:_ [[truth and beliefs]]

---

In this post for the rationalist website Lesswrong G Gordon Worley III compares the common rationalist concept that [[the map is not the territory]] with three Zen understandings:

1. _form and emptiness_ in which forms are fixed in our minds, while reality is empty of these forms;
2. _relative and absolute_ where _relative_ are those things that change (maps) in our minds, things that come and go; and the _absolute_ is the space in which the relative arises and exists "prior to our perception of it"[@worley_iii_zen_2020-1 n.pag.];
3. _guest and host_ (or _vassal and lord_) which -- according to Worley -- have less meaning for Western ways of thought

Worley III then compares these to two Western philosophical traditions:

1. Kant's _phenomena and noumena_ (although Worley III is critical of his own comparison here) [[noumenon and phenomenon]] and [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]] and [[gestell and enframing]] and [[device paradigm and focal things]] and [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]
2. Heidegger's _ontological and ontic_ which are, more or less, words and ideas about what is, versus what is.

_thoughts & links:_

- [[finger pointing at the moon]]
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
- [[map and territory]]
- [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]] -- the thread here is thin, but I wonder if the 'authentic' part of authentic movement might be conceived as a dance with the territory, or touching the territory. Momentary departures from the map of living to inhabit -- or re-member -- the perceiving and sensing body as it is. But, I can never know this and so the question really is what might be gained or learned from understanding the practice in this way? This idea is heading towards AM being a kind of noumenal engagement [[noumenon and phenomenon]]
- perhaps, following this thought, Heidegger's ideas re the ontic might be useful along with some more detailed research into _guest_ and _host_?
- [[paying attention]] -- "acceptance of present-moment reality". Touches on [[stockdale paradox]] as well -- committed attitude to the reality of a situation.
