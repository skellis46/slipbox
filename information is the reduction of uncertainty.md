# information is the reduction of uncertainty

_previous note:_ [[not knowing and surprise]]

> At any one time we have precisely one conscious experience out of vastly many possible conscious experiences. Every conscious experience therefore delivers a massive reduction of uncertainty, since this experience is being had, and not that experience, or that experience, and so on. And reduction of uncertainty is – mathematically – what is meant by information. [@seth-2021-being Loc 876]

Added this only because I find it fascinating. But of course it relates to Bayesian predictive processing -- as discuss elsewhere in [[Seth - Being You]]
