# to accrue interoceptive understanding

_previous note:_ [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]

Olivia Barry mentions interoception: 

> Rooted in movement and sensory perception, somatics explore the body to accrue interoceptive understanding and homeostatic awareness of the process of embodiment.[@barry-2022-tracing p.253]

- this sentence makes zero sense. what is the 'process of embodiment'?
