# the inexpressible nature of experience

_previous note:_ [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project]]

> What [the tea] tastes like for you ... I won't know. And I say, "What's your tea like?". "Oh, it's OK." Incredibly informative. "Is it delicious?" "Yuh, it's OK". It's very difficult for us to describe our experience because the aesthetic immediacy of the world is beyond apprehension. It's not a thing. You are there, you drink the tea ... there's nothing to do with it. The description you give of it is not it. Representation is always a lie and we live in a world of endless representations; of images about something, of stories about something. But the immediacy of the taste of the tea in your mouth is what you get; that's your world. How you see the tree, how you see the cars, how you see the people who are here. -- James Low 'The inexpressibility of life'.
