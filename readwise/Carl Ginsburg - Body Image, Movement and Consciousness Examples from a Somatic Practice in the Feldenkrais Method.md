## Highlights

> It is odd that we have made the activity of sentience into a noun. We say consciousness and not consciousing, implying that consciousness is a thing. Yet for other related activities we say we are sleeping or that we are dreaming. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtcasr7ghgt49kpvweznbb2))

> I am gradually making an inventory of some of the mundane activities of consciousing and deliberately leaving out such issues as symbolic thinking, subjective qualia, etc., that take attention away from the biological roots of what we put under the heading of consciousness.

> We do not usually study ourselves with this attention to what we experience. Nor do we consider the degree to which our activity results from the integration of so many different levels. On the contrary we tend to study the visual system as an isolated entity, or the behaviour of a subject in responding to a target stimulus. We do so because our analytical cognitive abilities are easy to use. We have organized cognitive systems available which, through complex organized entities such as language, symbolic pictorial representations, mathematics, we can ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtd0q4merc3xjs8zxmcm3g7))

> What I propose is that the phenomenology of the Feldenkrais Method allows one to connect changes in the domain of inner experience with changes in the organization of outer behaviour. It thus provides a way to observe the correlations between the domain of phenomenology and the domain of external observation.

> For Sacks the experience had an aspect of revelation as he realized the profound connection between his self image and his functioning, a phenomenological connection completely ignored in his medical training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbv77s80tt8kkhwpfthfycwt))

>  The phenomenology of the body-image is a profound subject. Here the body- image is linked completely to the return of organized functioning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbv783ep2n18ht9z0h4hby0y))


> although we do not control the learning process directly, the activities of consciousing are essential to this level of learning in which perceptions and actions are interlinked and constructed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbwvgqbhm0777q8dct77k8xs))
