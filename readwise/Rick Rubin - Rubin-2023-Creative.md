## Highlights

> To live as an artist is a way of being in the world. A way of perceiving. A practice of paying attention. Refining our sensitivity to tune in to the more subtle notes. Looking for what draws us in and what pushes us away. Noticing what feeling tones arise and where they lead. (Location 124)

## New highlights added April 5, 2023 at 4:14 PM

> Practicing a way of being that allows you to see the world through uncorrupted, innocent eyes can free you to act in concert with the universe’s timetable. (Location 179)


> Art is a circulation of energetic ideas. What makes them appear new is that they’re combining differently each time they come back. No two clouds are the same. (Location 202)


> Awareness moves differently. The program is happening around us. The world is the doer and we are the witness. We have little or no control over the content. (Location 216)


> As soon as you label an aspect of Source, you’re no longer noticing, you’re studying. This holds true of any thought that takes you out of presence with the object of your awareness, whether analysis or simply becoming aware that you’re aware. Analysis is a secondary function. The awareness happens first as a pure connection with the object of your attention. (Location 223)


> Though we can’t change what it is that we are noticing, we can change our ability to notice. We can expand our awareness and narrow it, experience it with our eyes open or closed. We can quiet our inside so we can perceive more on the outside, or quiet the outside so we can notice more of what’s happening inside. We can zoom in on something so closely it loses the features that make it what it appears to be, or zoom so far out it seems like something entirely new. (Location 226)


> The ability to look deeply is the root of creativity. To see past the ordinary and mundane and get to what might otherwise be invisible. (Location 234)


> Without the spiritual component, the artist works with a crucial disadvantage. The spiritual world provides a sense of wonder and a degree of open-mindedness not always found within the confines of science. The world of reason can be narrow and filled with dead ends, while a spiritual viewpoint is limitless and invites fantastic possibilities. The unseen world is boundless. (Location 275)


> If a piece of work, a fragment of consciousness, or an element of nature is somehow allowing us to access something bigger, that is its spiritual component made manifest. It awards us a glimpse of the unseen. (Location 289)


> A practice is the embodiment of an approach to a concept. This can support us in bringing about a desired state of mind. When we repeat the exercise of opening our senses to what is, we move closer to living in a continually open state. We build a habit. One where expanded awareness is our default way of being in the world. (Location 331)


> We tend to think of the artist’s work as the output. The real work of the artist is a way of being in the world. (Location 356)


> Nature transcends our tendencies to label and classify, to reduce and limit. (Location 390)


> Oscar Wilde said that some things are too important to be taken seriously. Art is one of those things. Setting the bar low, especially to get started, frees you to play, explore, and test without attachment to results. (Location 542)


> It’s worth noting the distinction between doubting the work and doubting yourself. An example of doubting the work would be, “I don’t know if my song is as good as it can be.” Doubting yourself might sound like, “I can’t write a good song.” (Location 563)


> Art creates a profound connection between the artist and the audience. Through that connection, both can heal. (Location 583)


> The more we pay attention, the more we begin to realize that all the work we ever do is a collaboration. (Location 608)


> The inspired-artist aspect of your self may be in conflict with the craftsperson aspect, disappointed that the craftsperson is unable to create the physical embodiment of the inspired artist’s vision. This is a common conflict for creators, since there is no direct conversion from abstract thought to the material world. The work is always an interpretation. (Location 612)


> The purpose of the work is to awaken something in you first, and then allow something to be awakened in others. And it’s fine if they’re not the same thing. (Location 623)


> What’s considered art is simply an agreement. And none of it is true. (Location 628)


> Intention is all there is. The work is just a reminder. (Location 666)


> Art is confrontation. It widens the audience’s reality, allowing them to glimpse life through a different window. (Location 684)


> Beware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it’s the way you’ve done it before. (Location 735)


> Formulating an opinion is not listening. Neither is preparing a response, or defending our position or attacking another’s. To listen impatiently is to hear nothing at all. Listening is suspending disbelief. (Location 782)


> Listening without prejudice is how we grow and learn as people. More often than not, there are no right answers, just different perspectives. The more perspectives we can learn to see, the greater our understanding becomes. Our filter can begin to more accurately approach what truly is, rather than a narrow sliver interpreted through our bias. (Location 790)


> Listening, then, is not just awareness. It’s freedom from accepted limitations. (Location 794)


> Patience is developed much like awareness. Through an acceptance of what is. Impatience is an argument with reality. The desire for something to be different from what we are experiencing in the here and now. (Location 819)


> If there is a rule to creativity that’s less breakable than the others, it’s that the need for patience is ever-present. (Location 829)


> This is beginner’s mind—one of the most difficult states of being to dwell in for an artist, precisely because it involves letting go of what our experiences have taught us. Beginner’s mind is starting from a pure childlike place of not knowing. Living in the moment with as few fixed beliefs as possible. Seeing things for what they are as presented. Tuning in to what enlivens us in the moment instead of what we think will work. And making our decisions accordingly. Any preconceived ideas and accepted conventions limit what’s possible. (Location 863)


> The more ingrained your adopted approach, the harder it is to see past it. Though experience doesn’t rule out innovation, it can make it more difficult to access. Animals, like children, don’t have a hard time making a decision. They act out of innate instinct, not learned behavior. This primitive force packs an ancient wisdom that science has yet to catch up with. These childlike superpowers include being in the moment, valuing play above all else, having no regard for consequences, being radically honest without consideration, and having the ability to freely move from one emotion to the next without holding on to story. For children, each moment in time is all there is. No future, no past. I want it now, I’m hungry, I’m tired. All pure authenticity. (Location 883)


> As artists, we aim to live in a way in which we see the extraordinary hidden in the seemingly mundane. Then challenge ourselves to share what we see in a way that allows others a glimpse of this remarkable beauty. (Location 901)


> Consider establishing a consistent framework around your creative process. It is often the case that the more set in your personal regimen, the more freedom you have within that structure to express yourself. (Location 979)


> Create an environment where you’re free to express what you’re afraid to express. (Location 1032)


> The heart of experiment is mystery. (Location 1096)


> If you know what you want to do and you do it, that’s the work of a craftsman. If you begin with a question and use it to guide an adventure of discovery, that’s the work of the artist. (Location 1116)


> There is a gap between imagination and reality. An idea might seem brilliant in our mind. But once employed, it might not work at all. Another might seem dreary at first. Then, upon execution, it might be exactly what’s called for. (Location 1138)


> To dismiss an idea because it doesn’t work in your mind is to do a disservice to the art. The only way to truly know if any idea works is to test it. And if you’re looking for the best idea, test everything. Ask yourself as many “what if” questions as you can. What if this were the first painting anyone saw in their life? What if I removed every adverb? What if I made all the loud parts quiet? Look for different polarities and see how they affect the piece. (Location 1140)


> It’s impossible, though, to know exactly what someone else is thinking. And if we can’t predict how our own ideas will work—and we can’t!—how can we draw conclusions about what someone else imagines? Instead of talking through different solutions to work out which is best, take it out of the realm of the verbal. To truly weigh choices, it’s necessary to bring them into the physical world. Have them acted out, played out, or built into a model. Descriptions do not do ideas justice. We want to set up an environment where the decision making occurs free of the misguiding force of persuasion. Persuasion leads to mediocrity. To be evaluated, ideas have to be seen, heard, tasted, or touched. (Location 1147)


> Demanding to control a work of art would be just as foolish as demanding that an oak tree grow according to your will. Allow the work to grow in the direction it seeks, evolve in accordance with its natural state, and have its own life. Enjoy the journey of cycling through all permutations to reveal a work’s true form. (Location 1159)


> How do we decide which experiment to craft? We continue to follow hints of excitement. Each one of us has to find our own path. If several directions seem captivating, consider crafting more than one experiment at a time. Working on several often brings about a healthy sense of detachment. (Location 1180)


> Art is choosing to do something skillfully, caring about the details, bringing all of yourself to make the finest work you can. It is beyond ego, vanity, self-glorification, and need for approval. (Location 1274)


> The goal of art isn’t to attain perfection. The goal is to share who we are. And how we see the world. Artists allow us to see what we are unable to see, but somehow already know. It may be a view of the world singularly different from our own. Or one so close, it seems miraculous, as if the artist is looking through our own eyes. In either case, the artist’s perception reminds us of who we are and who we can be. (Location 1280)


> When making art, we create a mirror in which someone may see their own hidden reflection. (Location 1293)


> The general principle is to be protective and limit people you’re working with from experiencing things that could interfere with their creative process. Limit the information to the barest of sketches. If you want creators to bring all of themselves to something, give them the most freedom to create. (Location 1403)


> Once you feel a project is close to completion, it can be helpful to open the work to other perspectives. The primary aim is not to receive notes or opinions. This is your work, your expression. You are the only audience that matters. The intention is for you to experience the work anew. When playing music for someone else, we hear it differently than when we listen to it ourselves. It’s as if borrowing a second set of ears. We’re not necessarily looking for an outside perspective. We are more interested in widening our own. (Location 1426)


> If someone chooses to share feedback, listen to understand the person, not the work. People will tell you more about themselves than about the art when giving feedback. We each see a unique world. (Location 1434)


> Part of the process of letting go is releasing any thoughts of how you or your piece will be received. When making art, the audience comes last. Let’s not consider how a piece will be received or our release strategy until the work is finished and we love it. (Location 1475)


> A rule is a way of structuring awareness. (Location 1592)


> If we can tune in to the idea of making things and sharing them without being attached to the outcome, the work is more likely to arrive in its truest form. (Location 1652)


> Zoom in and obsess. Zoom out and observe. We get to choose. (Location 1670)


> As Theodore Roosevelt pointed out, comparison is the thief of joy. Besides, why would we want to create with the purpose of diminishing someone else? (Location 1748)


> Distilling a work to get it as close to its essence as possible is a useful and informative practice. Notice how many pieces you can remove before the work you’re making ceases to be the work you’re making. Refine it to the point where it is stripped bare, in its least decorative form yet still intact. With nothing extra. Sometimes the ornamentation can be of use, often not. Less is generally more. (Location 1785)


> In the end, the sum total of the essence of our individual works may serve as a reflection. The closer we get to the true essence of each work, the sooner they will somehow, at some point in time, provide clues as to our own. (Location 1797)


> In cases when the artist thinks they know, their interpretation may not be accurate or the whole story. We live in a mysterious world full of uncertainties. And we regularly make assumptions to explain them. Coming to terms with the complexity of our human experience allows us to exit our natural state of confusion. To survive. Generally our explanations are guesses. These vague hypotheticals become fixed in our minds as fact. We are interpretation machines, and this process of labeling and detaching is efficient but not accurate. We are the unreliable narrators of our own experience. (Location 1813)

> Let’s make art, and let others make the stories. (Location 1828)


> All that matters is that you are making something you love, to the best of your ability, here and now. (Location 1857)


> Our definition of self-awareness as artists relates directly to the way we tune in to our inner experience, not the way we are externally perceived. The more we identify with our self as it exists through the eyes of others, the more disconnected we become and the less energy we have to draw from. We extend our reach for a higher consciousness. Releasing attachment to our perceived self and limitations. We are seeking not to define ourselves, but to expand ourselves, to tune in to our limitlessness nature and connection to all that is. Self-awareness is a transcendence. An abandonment of ego. A letting go. (Location 1877)


> When you look at the work, practice truly seeing what’s there, without a negativity bias. Be open to seeing both strength and weakness, instead of focusing on the weakness and allowing it to overwhelm the strength. (Location 1902)


> If you are open and stay tuned to what’s happening, the answers will be revealed. (Location 1910)


> To hear whispers, the mind must also be quiet. We pay close attention on all fronts. Our antennae sensitively tuned. (Location 1926)


> If we’re paying attention, we may notice that some of our most interesting artistic choices come about by accident. Springing from moments of communion with the work, when the self disappears. Sometimes they feel like mistakes. (Location 1937)


> For some artists, being surprised is a rare experience. But it’s possible to cultivate this gift through invitation. One way is through letting go of control. Release all expectations about what the work will be. Approach the process with humility and the unexpected will visit more often (Location 1944)


> Living in discovery is at all times preferable to living through assumptions. (Location 1955)


> When we sit down to work, remember that the outcome is out of our control. If we are willing to take each step into the unknown with grit and determination, carrying with us all of our collected knowledge, we will ultimately get to where we’re going. This destination may not be one we’ve chosen in advance. It will likely be more interesting. (Location 1964)


> You work not as an evangelist, expecting miracles, but as a scientist, testing and adjusting and testing again. Experimenting and building on the results. Faith is rewarded, perhaps even more than talent or ability. (Location 1968)


> The heart of open-mindedness is curiosity. Curiosity doesn’t take sides or insist on a single way of doing things. It explores all perspectives. Always open to new ways, always seeking to arrive at original insights. Craving constant expansion, it looks upon the outer limits of the mind with wonder. It pushes to expose falsely set boundaries and break through to new frontiers. (Location 2008)


> Do what you can with what you have. Nothing more is needed. (Location 2053)


> You may sometimes wonder: Why am I doing this? What’s it all for? Questions such as these come early and often for some. Others seem to go their whole lives without ever troubling themselves with these thoughts. Maybe they know that the maker and the explainer are always two different people, even when they’re the same person. (Location 2169)


> often for some. Others seem to go their whole lives without (Location 2170)


> Think to yourself: I’m just here to create. (Location 2177)


> The work of art serves its purpose independent of the creator’s interest in social responsibility. Wanting to change people’s minds about an issue or have an effect on society may interfere with the quality and purity of the work. (Location 2184)


> This doesn’t mean that our work can’t have those qualities, but we generally don’t get there by planning them. In the creative process, it’s often more difficult to accomplish a goal by aiming at it. Deciding what to say in advance doesn’t allow whatever’s best to come. Meaning is assigned once an inspired idea is followed through. It’s best to wait until a work is complete to discover what it is saying. Holding your work hostage to meaning is a limitation. (Location 2186)


> Art is far more powerful than our plans for it. (Location 2191)


> The only practice that matters is the one you consistently do, not the practice of any other artist. (Location 2240)


> As Arn Anderson once noted: “I’m both a professor and student, because if you’re no longer a student, you don’t have the right to call yourself a professor.” (Location 2280)


> This is the practice of cleaning the slate. The ability to create as an artist and experience the work as a first-time viewer, dropping baggage from the past of what you thought you wanted the work to be. The mission is to be in the present moment with the work. (Location 2303)


> A common practice is to make those changes, tick each item off the checklist, and then play back the song with the list in mind. Okay, are the vocals in the bridge louder as I requested? Yes, check. Does the drum fill in the transition seem more important? Yes, check. You’re anticipating each part. Selectively paying attention to see if your changes were made, rather than listening to the song as a whole and seeing if it’s actually better than it was before. The ego comes in, saying: I wanted this to happen, I got what I wanted, so it’s a problem solved. (Location 2309)


> But this isn’t necessarily true. Yes, the changes were made, but did they improve the work? Or have they set off a domino effect that created other problems? At this stage in the process, every element of a work is interdependent. So even a small change can have unexpected ramifications. When the mix is updated to reflect your list, you may falsely assume you’ve made progress. (Location 2314)


> Look past the principle element, examine the variables around it. Play with different combinations. Place it next to other works. Surprise yourself. A few common options are: soft-loud fast-slow high-low close-far bright-dark large-small curved-straight rough-smooth before-after inside-outside same-different (Location 2344)


> Sharing art is the price of making it. Exposing your vulnerability is the fee. (Location 2393)


> Every artist creates a dynamic history. A living museum of finished objects. One work after another. Begun, completed, released. Begun, completed, released. Over and over again. Each a time stamp commemorating a moment of passage. A moment filled with energy, now forever embodied in a work of art. (Location 2395)


> In play, there are no stakes. No boundaries. No right or wrong. No quotas for productivity. It’s an uninhibited state where your spirit can run free. The best ideas arise most often and easily through this relaxed state. (Location 2412)


> Find a clue, follow a lead, remain unattached to what came before. And avoid getting stuck with a decision you made five minutes ago. Think back to when you were a hopeful beginner, when the tools of your craft were exotic and new. Remember the fascination of learning, the joys of your first steps forward. This might be the best way to retain the energy that drives the work, and to fall in love with the practice again and again. (Location 2426)


> In a prism, a single beam of light enters and is broken into an array of colors. The self, too, is a prism. Neutral events enter, and are transformed into a spectrum of feelings, thoughts, and sensations. All this information is processed distinctively by each aspect of self, refracting life’s light in its own way, and emitting different shades of art. (Location 2473)


> First, do no harm. This credo is the well-known guiding principle of the physician’s oath. Consider it a universal precept. If asked to participate in a fellow creator’s project, proceed delicately. In its rough form, an early iteration of a work may hold an extraordinary magic. Above all this is to be protected. When working alongside others, keep the oath front of mind. (Location 2490)


> Competition serves the ego. Cooperation supports the highest outcome. (Location 2508)


> It is a disservice to the project to weigh our contribution to it. Believing an idea is best because it’s ours is an error of inexperience. The ego demands personal authorship, inflating itself at the expense of the art. It can reject new methods that appear counterintuitive and protect familiar ones. The best results are found when we’re impartial and detached from our own strategies. We all benefit when the best idea is chosen, regardless of whether it’s ours or not. (Location 2510)


> When I work with artists, we make an agreement: We continue the process until reaching the point where we are all happy with the work. (Location 2515)


> The moment one collaborator gives in and settles on a less preferential option for the sake of moving forward, everyone loses. Great decisions aren’t made in a spirit of sacrifice. They’re made by the mutual recognition of the best solution available. (Location 2521)


> As long as we’re not attached to having it be our way, we welcome this friction. It’s bringing us closer to the best version of the work at hand. (Location 2535)


> Some collaborations operate more like dictatorships than democracies. This system can work as well. In these cases, everyone agrees to line up behind one person’s vision and do all they can to manifest it. Whether the final decision is made by a single leader or a collective, it’s still a collaborative act. The participants are offering up their best work in the spirit of cooperation. (Location 2536)


> Though you may have a specific fix in mind, hold back from sharing it immediately. The recipient may be able to come up with a better solution on their own. (Location 2546)


> When on the receiving end of feedback, our task is to set aside ego and work to fully understand the critique offered. (Location 2547)


> It requires patience and diligence to get past the story of what you think you’re hearing and get close to understanding what’s actually being said. (Location 2552)


> It dissipates the level of emotional charge and enables us to work together in service of the piece. The (Location 2557)


> The synergy of a group is as important— if not more important— than the talent of the individuals. (Location 2559)


> In art, sincerity is a by-product. It cannot be the primary aim. (Location 2568)


> Editing is a demonstration of taste. It isn’t expressed through pointing to items we like: the music that pleases our ear or the films we revisit. Our taste is revealed in how our work is curated. What’s included, what’s not, and how the pieces are put together. (Location 2594)


> The container is the organizing principle of the work. It dictates which elements do and don’t belong. (Location 2598)


> Avoid confusing the editor’s cold detachment with the inner critic. The critic doubts the work, undermines it, zooms in and picks it apart. The editor steps back, views the work holistically, and supports its full potential. (Location 2602)


> The editor is the professional in the poet. (Location 2603)


> In addition to getting to the heart of the work, through this brutal edit we change our relationship to it. We come to understand its underlying structure and realize what truly matters, to disconnect from the attachment of making it and see it for what it is. (Location 2614)


> Being an artist means to be continually asking, “How can it be better?” whatever it is. It may be your art, and it may be your life. (Location 2628)


> The reason we’re alive is to express ourselves in the world. And creating art may be the most effective and beautiful method of doing so. Art goes beyond language, beyond lives. It’s a universal way to send messages between each other and through time. (Location 2654)


> We have stories about ourselves, and those are not who we are. We have stories about the work, and those are not what the work is. (Location 2695)


> All our efforts to make sense of ourselves and our art are a smoke screen, an obfuscation. They don’t illuminate what is. They mislead us. We have no way of knowing what is insignificant and what is essential, or what our contributions mean. (Location 2697)
