## Highlights

> • What is the argument about and what is being claimed? • What are the reasons given to support the conclusion? Is the reasoning flawed in anyway? • What kind of evidence is being presented (i.e. intuition, appeals to authority, observation, case studies, research studies, analogies, etc) and how good is it? • What other explanations might be plausible than that offered? • Is the conclusion provided the most reasonable? Can you identify alternatives? ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=88))

> Most scholars have come to the conclusion that a complex mix of social and psychological factors account for persistence and resilience in PhD study. Success in undergraduate study usually comes from following rules and passing exams, which don't teach you to be creative or innovative - or develop your emotional maturity.

> In the scientific method the questions are raised before the experiments designed to answer them. Sure fresh questions will probably emerge as the scientific work progresses, but always to drive a new cycle of research. In other disciplines, this is not the case. Research questions may not be known in advance or may change substantially during the research - they may only emerge clearly at the very end. There will not necessarily be experiments to generate data, but observations, interviews, painting, the making of car engines and so on.

> So if you find yourself being pressed under the dead hand of the thesis genre remember that the summary judgment of your thesis by the examiner will be made on how well your thesis 'sings the song' of the content within it. Your job is to make that song lively, not a funeral dirge. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=285))

> The seminal paper is "It's a PhD, not a Nobel Prize: how experienced examiners assess research theses" by Gerry Mullins and Margaret Kiley. I consider this paper required reading for every research student, regardless of their location or discipline. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=291))

> Most people discussed ideas with their immediate work colleagues (within clusters) but relatively few people would act as 'bridgers' and talk to colleagues across clusters. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=348))

> Here's where it gets interesting for you. Think about it for a moment: what do you spend most of your time on while doing your PhD? Probably doing experiments, making stuff  (or whatever it is you do) and/or reading the work of others. Hopefully you will also be hanging out with your peers and talking to your supervisors. These are good ways of generating ideas, but could you be doing more? Administrators and academics in my university constantly complain that it's hard to convince PhD students to attend lunchtime seminars put on by other researchers. When I was doing my PhD it always seemed like a waste of time to break my flow and attend such events unless I knew the person who was presenting, or the topic of the seminar seemed especially relevant. I always assumed that the discussion was unlikely to have any direct relevance  - but what about indirect relevance? Might I have missed out on many opportunities to cross breed exciting new idea hybrids? ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=360))

> The key point they all make is that the lit review must be more than a list of things you read – it has to have an argument and a point of view. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=374))

> 1. Sketch out the nature of the field relevant to the inquiry – including history if relevant and 2. Identify major debates and define terms, in order to 3. Establish which studies, ideas and/or methods are most pertinent to your study, and 4. Locate gaps in the field, in order to 5. Create a warrant for the study in question, and 6. Identify the contribution the study might make ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=377))

> You must work at forming critical judgment on the literature by reading it, at the same time as you work on finding patterns in the mess of information. It’s important to realise that these patterns are not ‘real’ – you make them by sorting and presenting the information in particular ways. This sorting process makes the raw information legible so that you can start to write an argument from it. ([Location 384](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=384))

> It comes from the seminal book ‘Information Anxiety’ by Richard Saul Wurzman. Yes, you heard right – Wurzman is the creator of the TED talks (good pedigree I think!). Wurzman argues that there are only 5 ways to organise information, which he calls LATCH: Location, Alphabet, Time, Category and Hierarchy. These organising principles can be used to perform simple operations on the material you have. Here are some ideas.

> This question hit me right in the stomach. I was 16, but (sadly) this is the first time I realised a teacher could consciously choose – or even be forced -  to lie. Simultaneously I realised how conditioned I was to believing teachers unquestioningly. I can honestly say this moment changed my life. I felt liberated. I didn’t have to believe my teachers anymore!

> Sometimes you don’t have to know what the outcome of a process will be – you just have to do it and see what happens. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=453))

> Many treat doing a thesis like a project which has to be ‘managed’, not a difficult and troublesome learning process. Research degree learning involves encountering and changing some deeply habitual ways of operating and thinking. The project management approach doesn’t always work. Unfortunately, when it doesn’t, it’s all too easy to blame yourself for not working ‘efficiently’ – when this isn’t the problem you need to solve. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=458))

> A good way to move forward is to ask yourself: “Is there anything I need to unlearn?” ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=465))

> There are deep and subtle connections between research thinking and research writing. Most people don’t notice how much these writing and thinking are shaped by the kinds of tools that are used to carry them out. The Philosopher Michel Foucault claimed (and please forgive the drastic simplification those of you who are steeped in the subtleties of Foucault) the way we think and act is always shaped by the action of other people and things. Paying attention to the tools you use and working out ways to hack them to work better for you pays dividends in terms of time and frustration.

> When you are stuck in the line by line, word by word business of writing it is easier to lose sight of overall purpose; how the part we are writing relates to the whole. I have never yet met anyone capable of writing a whole 90,000 thesis in this stream of consciousness / linear way (but feel free to write to me if you have!). To re-orient during the writing process most of us will stop to read back what we have written. The danger here is Editing. Too much editing at the initial drafting stage is, more often than not, the enemy of Done. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=523))

You can work through ideas for structure quickly in this way, perhaps taking a photo of each one before you rub it out so you have a record.

> One of the things the examiners Mullins and Kiley interviewed said was that they want to learn something new from reading your thesis. This tells us that a thesis is more than a show of erudition; it must inform and explain at the same time as showing off your scholarly abilities.

> Use brackets to diagnose 'fuzz' in your text: All writers (will have to) edit their prose, but (the) great writers edit (it) viciously, always trying to eliminate (words which are) 'fuzz' - (excess) words (which are not adding anything of value). Zinsser compares (the process of editing out) 'fuzz' to fighting weeds - you will always be slightly behind (because they creep in when you aren't looking for them). One of my (pet hates) is (the word) 'also'. (If you search and replace all instances (of this word) you will find you can live without it and your writing will improve (instantly). (Likewise the word)'very'.) ([Location 912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B009GPRSP0&location=912))
