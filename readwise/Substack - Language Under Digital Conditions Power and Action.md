## Highlights

> If it helps, perhaps we might reframe these concerns as a question: *What are the conditions under which language can properly function as the ground of meaning, communication, and action*? And, then: To what degree do these conditions obtain in digitally mediated environments? I have in mind both the power of language as a tool of comprehension and as a tool of action—as a tool of ordering human experience and organizing human action.

> I think there’s something to it, partly because of how the history of human institutions and the history of technology are interwoven. Neil Postman put this as succinctly as possible in *Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology* (1992):
>  > Surrounding every technology are institutions whose organization–not to mention their reason for being–reflects the world-view promoted by the technology. Therefore, when an old technology is assaulted by a new one, institutions are threatened. When institutions are threatened, a culture finds itself in crisis.

> In a line that seems even more striking today, Arendt went on to write that “it would be as though our brain, which constitutes the physical, material condition of our thoughts, were unable to follow what we do, so that from now on we would indeed need artificial machines to do our thinking and speaking.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr3h6rgj4jpkcsbq68ms932))


> Steiner goes on to detail how the language of mathematics gradually captured one field or discipline after another: history, economics, philosophy, and even strands of modern music and art. He then sums up his argument in this way:
>  > Until the seventeenth century, the sphere of language encompassed nearly the whole of experience and reality; today it comprises a narrower domain. It no longer articulates, or is relevant to, all major modes of action, thought, and sensibility. Large areas of meaning and praxis now belong to such non-verbal languages as mathematics, symbolic logic, and formulas of chemical or electronic relation.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr41qzkg33cs2hh2xatghn9))


> But it was not until the advent of algorithmic society that large swaths of everyday experience became similarly opaque and unresponsive to ordinary language. Now we are all increasingly confronted by the dynamics Arendt and Steiner described. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvr4a5f02yqwntsct3qh7ter))


> It is not just that the language of the average citizen is no longer adequate to give an account of the natural world that accords with the esoteric realities discovered by modern science. Nor is it merely the case that we all now confront problems whose scale makes them resistant to human understanding and human action. It is that our lives are increasingly structured by systems and devices which operate according to mathematical, statistical, and algorithmic logic, a logic that often escapes the understanding not only of those whose lives are subject to the systems and devices but even that of those who create and deploy the systems and devices. And one suspects that these systems are resistant to political control not only because of the fecklessness of politicians or the corrupting influences of wealth but precisely because they themselves have become the true governing principle of modern society.

> I will only say that for Arendt, speech was bound up with natality—the promise of new beginnings, the realm of actions which yield unpredictable consequences. To render speech the outcome of prediction seems to bind it up with mortality instead, with the expected end rather than the unexpected beginning.
