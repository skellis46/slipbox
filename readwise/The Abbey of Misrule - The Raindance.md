> In England, when you meet someone new, it’s common to ask them what they do. In Ireland, it’s common to ask them where they’re from, and it’s a highly localised question. ‘Where are you from?’ in the countryside means which village, townland or house, rather than which nation or even county. This way of locating people in space is very ancient. *Who are your people?* it asks, *and what is your place?* It’s a way of seeing that is dying now, and would not be found amongst the new urban generations, for whom all places are much the same, all mediated from within the digital non-place we drift amongst. But this old question - *where are you from?* - is the universal, aboriginal enquiry. It cuts to the heart of the matter.

> In my [very first essay](https://substack.com/redirect/c97d9689-8cb8-4e38-bfc1-34544b9fc41b?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) here, two years and two months ago, I wrote about Simone Weil’s 1943 book *The Need For Roots,* which explores the peculiar rootlessness of twentieth century humanity, and what that circumstance has denied us:
>  > *To be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognised need of the human soul. It is one of the hardest to define. A human being has roots by virtue of his real, active and natural participation in the life of a community which preserves in living shape certain particular treasures of the past and certain particular expectations of the future … Every human being needs to have multiple roots. It is necessary for him to draw wellnigh the whole of his moral, intellectual and spiritual life by way of the environment of which he forms a natural part.*
>  We all need multiple roots. My essay series here has exhaustively chronicled the rise of this thing I call ‘the Machine’ - an external manifestation of an inner hunger - and how it has steadily dug up so many of those roots. We would all like to blame someone else for this, but Weil will not allow it:
>  > *For centuries now, men of the white race have everywhere destroyed the past, stupidly, blindly, both at home and abroad. If in certain respects there has been, nevertheless, progress during this period, it is not because of this frenzy but in spite of it, under the impulse of what little of the past remained alive.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4d7a1qgkb776hnxb2cf6j12))
