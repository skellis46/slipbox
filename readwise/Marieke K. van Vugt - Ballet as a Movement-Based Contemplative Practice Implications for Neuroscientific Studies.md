## Highlights

> In both dance training and contemplative movement, one learns to control the body very precisely, and this requires an assortment of mental skills as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyyjt1k24dm931zfskcrxqfs))


+++++ 
- Note: this is debatable


> Many ballet dancers even feel the need to resort to yoga, gyrokinesis, or pilates to attune themselves to their bodies again. In contrast, contemporary dancers typically work without mirrors, and focus more on interoceptive signals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyyk3ts7ky6vv03kxqm8d67g))


> Consequently, I predict that there is a clear difference between dance forms in the extent to which interoception is developed. Since in classical ballet, dancers tend to rely more on mirrors to correct their position and create the desired shapes with their body, I predict classical dancers have an interoceptive accuracy not different from non-dancers, while for modern dancers, who tend to rely less on mirrors, there should be superior interoceptive accuracy compared to non-dancers. One study that investigated the relationship between interoceptive accuracy (in that case, for emotions) in both dancers and meditators showed that meditators were the most accurate, followed by dancers, who were still more accurate than participants from the general population ([Sze et al., 2010](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00513/full#B29)). However, this study did not separate modern from classical dancers. Studies of the neural circuitry underlying interoception in dancers are missing altogether. So, even though interoception is likely to be trained in both dance and contemplation, the jury is still out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyyk5jr4j3s28rm9ykwr98dz))


> Interestingly, while ballet dancers tend to use meta-cognition to ensure that they are still delivering the correct product (dance) to the audience, contemplatives use meta-cognition to primarily observe their own mental state. The meta-cognition that dancers use, in view of a project delivery is typically highly critical and judgmental, while yogis train to observe their mind and body with a non-judgmental attitude. It could even be said that an important function of meta-cognition in contemplation is monitoring whether or not one is reacting judgmentally. Consequently, comparing dancers and contemplatives on meta-cognition would be an interesting way to isolate externally-directed from internally-directed meta-cognition. Moreover, it will be interesting to see whether those two types of meta-cognition are associated with different neural correlates, along the lines of the suggested difference between meta-cognition of emotions and bodily state versus cognitive states ([Fox and Christoff, 2014](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00513/full#B10)).
