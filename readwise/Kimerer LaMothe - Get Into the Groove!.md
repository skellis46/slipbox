## Highlights

> The implications are twofold. On the one hand, as humans dances, they grow more sensitive and responsive to the rhythms in and around them – even in moments when they are not actively dancing. A heightened sensitivity to rhythm stays with us as we move through the day, boosting moods and cognitive abilities.
>  On the other hand, as this awareness develops, so does our capacity to discern whether or not synchronizing with a particular rhythm will enhance our health and well-being. Not all beats are life-enabling.
