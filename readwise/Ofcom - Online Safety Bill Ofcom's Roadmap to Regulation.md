## Highlights

> We know that
>  many services already take measures aimed at protecting their users. Most services have terms of
>  service that prohibit sharing of harmful or illegal content, and moderate content in response to user
>  complaints. Some services use sophisticated automated content detection tools. Many work closely
>  with civil society, protection agencies and law enforcement to help address the most serious harms
>  such as child sexual abuse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7adf91avbr65a0e9403znb5))

> But almost all online harms are complex and multi-faceted, and require similarly
>  complex, multi-faceted solutions. We will work with relevant stakeholders to build shared
>  understanding and identify opportunities to collaborate to develop new approaches and, if relevant,
>  standards. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7adg41de1g9ytvbyha88g6n))

> . The Bill does not
>  necessarily require that services are able to stop all instances of harmful content or assess every
>  item of content for their potential to cause harm – again the duties on services are limited by what
>  is proportionate and technically feasible.
>  Some services will be assigned a category which bring additional duties. There are three special
>  categories:
>  • Category 1: the highest reach user-to-user services with the highest risk functionalities, with
>  transparency requirements, a duty to assess risks to adults of legal but harmful content,
>  requirements relating to fraudulent advertising and a variety of other duties.
>  • Category 2a services: the highest reach search services, with transparency and fraudulent
>  advertising requirements.
>  • Category 2b services: other services with potentially risky functionalities or other factors, with
>  transparency requirements, but no other additional duties.
>  The Government has estimated4 that around 30 to 40 services will meet the threshold to be assigned
>  a category based on current policy intention. As such, we anticipate that most in-scope services will
>  not fall into any of these special categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7adgt56nq5fcfp3ebxwe85w))

  Note how in category 1 (which is basically social media I would think) the film has a duty to assess risks to adults of legal but harmful content.


> Under the Bill, services can choose whether to host content that is legal but harmful to adults, and
>  Ofcom cannot compel them to remove it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7adm73qj9cq0d6m1drrjyw5))


+++++ 
- Note: p.6


> The online safety regime can be thought of as being divided into four key areas. Each of these areas
>  will have specific requirements on services, and a timeline for implementation. These areas are:
>  1. Protecting people from illegal content;
>  2. Protecting children from age inappropriate content;
>  3. Empowering adults to protect themselves from legal but harmful content; and
>  4. Increasing public transparency of categorised services’ actions to protect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7aedtc33eptf7h48nmmfy1s))


+++++ 
- Note: p.13. Particularly the one about empowering adults to protect themselves from legal but harmful content
