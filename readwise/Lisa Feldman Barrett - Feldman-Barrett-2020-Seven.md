## Highlights

> You can think about energy efficiency like a budget. A financial budget tracks money as it’s earned and spent. A budget for your body similarly tracks resources like water, salt, and glucose as you gain and lose them. Each action that spends resources, such as swimming or running, is like a withdrawal from your account. Actions that replenish your resources, such as eating and sleeping, are like deposits. This is a simplified explanation, but it captures the key idea that running a body requires biological resources. Every action you take (or don’t take) is an economic choice​—​your brain is guessing when to spend resources and when to save them. (Location 94)


> allostasis. (Location 108)


> The scientific name for body budgeting is allostasis. It means automatically predicting and preparing to meet the body’s needs before they arise. (Location 109)


> Your brain’s most important job is to control your body​—​to manage allostasis​—by predicting energy needs before they arise so you can efficiently make worthwhile movements and survive. (Location 137)


> Of course, your brain does think and feel and imagine and create hundreds of other experiences, such as letting you read and understand this book. But all of these mental capacities are consequences of a central mission to keep you alive and well by managing your body budget. Everything your brain creates, from memories to hallucinations, from ecstasy to shame, is part of this mission. (Location 141)


> According to this evolutionary story, the human brain ended up with three layers​—​one for surviving, one for feeling, and one for thinking​—​an arrangement known as the triune brain. The deepest layer, or lizard brain, which we allegedly inherited from ancient reptiles, is said to house our survival instincts. The middle layer, dubbed the limbic system, supposedly contains ancient parts for emotion that we inherited from prehistoric mammals. The outermost layer, part of the cerebral cortex, is said to be uniquely human and the source of rational thought; it’s known as the neocortex (“new cortex”). (Location 169)


> All mammals have a relatively big cortex in a brain that’s relatively large for their body size. Our cortex is just a scaled-up version of the relatively smaller cortex found in relatively smaller-brained monkeys, chimps, and many carnivores. It’s also a scaled-down version of the larger cortex found in the larger brains of elephants and whales. If a monkey’s brain could grow to human size, its cerebral cortex would be the same size as ours. (Location 253)


> The size of our cerebral cortex, therefore, is not evolutionarily novel and does not require any special explanation. (Location 257)


> Anything you read or hear that proclaims the human neocortex, cerebral cortex, or prefrontal cortex to be the root of rationality, or says that the frontal lobe regulates so-called emotional brain areas to keep irrational behavior in check, is simply outdated or woefully incomplete. The triune brain idea and its epic battle between emotion, instinct, and rationality is a modern myth. (Location 264)


> Natural selection did not aim itself toward us​—​we’re just an interesting sort of animal with particular adaptations that helped us survive and reproduce in particular environments. Other animals are not inferior to humans. They are uniquely and effectively adapted to their environments. Your brain is not more evolved than a rat or lizard brain, just differently evolved. (Location 272)


> Perhaps rationality is better defined in terms of the brain’s most important job: body budgeting​—​managing all the water, salt, glucose, and other bodily resources we use every day. In this view, rationality means spending or saving resources to succeed in your immediate environment. (Location 286)


> What we call mental illnesses, then, may be rational body-budgeting for the short term that’s out of sync with the immediate environment, the needs of other people, or your own best interests down the road. (Location 300)


> Even a simple reaching action like this, when done more than once, can be guided by different sets of neurons. This phenomenon is called degeneracy. (Location 400)


> Brains of higher complexity can remember more. A brain doesn’t store memories like files in a computer​—​it reconstructs them on demand with electricity and swirling chemicals. We call this process remembering but it’s really assembling. (Location 443)


> After months of practice sharing attention with caregivers, an infant will learn to elicit shared attention from them. He will look at them as a way of asking whether something is in his niche and what it might mean for his body budget. In this manner, the infant learns to focus attention even more effectively on things that matter. (Location 560)


> This arrangement helps our cultural and social knowledge flow efficiently from generation to generation. Each little brain becomes optimized for its particular environment, the one it developed in. Caregivers curate a baby’s physical and social niche, and the baby’s brain learns that niche. When the baby grows up, he perpetuates that niche by passing his culture to the next generation through his words and actions, wiring their brains in turn. This process, called cultural inheritance, is efficient and frugal because evolution doesn’t have to encode all our wiring instructions in genes. It off-loads much of the job to the world around us, including the other humans in that world. We unknowingly wire the knowledge of our culture into our offspring after birth, for better or worse.
