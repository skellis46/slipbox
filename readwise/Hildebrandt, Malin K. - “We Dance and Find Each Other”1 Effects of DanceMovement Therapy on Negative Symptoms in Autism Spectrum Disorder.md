## Highlights

> In accordance with these findings, but going beyond embodied simulation theory, the interdisciplinary embodiment or embodied cognition approach assumes that cognition in general is essentially grounded in bodily states [[17](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/6/4/24#B17-behavsci-06-00024)]. Our perception of the world, and thus also our interaction with it, is entirely mediated by our bodies. For example, if we perceive an object, by whichever sensual modality, this perception becomes apparent to us by reactions of receptors, indicating a change to the “unstimulated” baseline state. Thus, all perceptions are at the same time self-affections and necessarily self-referential. Furthermore, perception leads to an awareness of one’s own body movement in the environment. Our experience of the world results from this self-referential interaction with our surroundings characterized by perception and movement. Hence any changes in normal functioning of the connection of our perception (e.g., visually observing social cues) and movement via our brain (e.g., the activated mirror neurons by observing social cues) have an influence on our experience of the world [[18](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/6/4/24#B18-behavsci-06-00024)] and therefore on our mind. Rather than solely focusing on the causative influence of the mind on the body, this notion highlights the reciprocal conjunction of both entities, thereby providing a new theoretical starting point for therapeutic interventions.

> Non-conventional therapy approaches such as dance movement therapy (DMT) correspond to the theoretical implications of embodiment, highlighting the role of motor movement and sensorimotor experience for mental states and as a medium for therapeutic change. Yet, embodiment is a theoretical construct and not a psychotherapeutic method, and while embodiment approaches provide a rich and sound theoretical framework for psychotherapy (e.g., [[26](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/6/4/24#B26-behavsci-06-00024)]), they are not sufficient for an adequate understanding of all the aspects of the therapeutic approaches falling into their domain.
