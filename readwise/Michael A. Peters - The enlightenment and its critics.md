## Highlights

> The so-called Late Enlightenment was dominated by Immanuel Kant
>  (1724–1804) whose Critique of Pure Reason (1781), alongside his other critiques (The Critique of
>  Practical Reason, 1788; The Critique of Judgement, 1790), came to be viewed as the monumental
>  work that initiated modern philosophy by seeking to determine the limits of reason and meta-
>  physics—that is, what kind of claims can reason be expected to establish securely. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhssv54k6k9n68a3nrne6za))

> In an important essay J. G. A. Pocock (2008, p. 84) on the historiography of the
>  Enlightenment writes
>  ‘Enlightenment’ is a word or signifier, and not a single or unifiable phenomenon which it consistently
>  signifies. There is no single or unifiable phenomenon describable as ‘the Enlightenment’… . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhsxxvgat9jjqgw2dbr5hjm))


> Bouie (2018) begins his article for Slate
>  The Enlightenment is having a renaissance, of sorts. A handful of centrist and conservative writers have
>  reclaimed the 17th- and 18th-century intellectual movement as a response to nationalism and ethnic
>  prejudice on the right and relativism and ‘identity politics’ on the left. Among them are Jordan Peterson,
>  the Canadian psychologist who sees himself as a bulwark against the forces of ‘chaos’ and ‘postmodernism’;
>  Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist who argues, in Enlightenment Now, for optimism and
>  human progress against those ‘who despise the Enlightenment ideals of reason, science, humanism, and
>  progress’; and conservative pundit Jonah Goldberg, who, in Suicide of the West, argues in defense of
>  capitalism and Enlightenment liberalism, twin forces he calls ‘the Miracle’ for creating Western prosperity.

> In his ‘What is Enlightenment?’, almost as famous as Kant’s essay, Foucault (1984)10 reflecting
>  on a philosophy of the present writes:
>  Now the way Kant poses the question of Aufkl€arung is entirely different: it is neither a world era to which
>  one belongs, nor an event whose signs are perceived, nor the dawning of an accomplishment. Kant defines
>  Aufkl€arung in an almost entirely negative way, as an Ausgang,an ‘exit,’ a ‘way out.’
>  And he goes on
>  Kant indicates right away that the ‘way out’ that characterizes Enlightenment is a process that releases us
>  from the status of ‘immaturity.’ And by ‘immaturity,’ he means a certain state of our will that makes us
>  accept someone else’s authority to lead us in areas where the use of reason is called for… He characterizes
>  it as a phenomenon, an ongoing process; but he also presents it as a task and an obligation. From the very
>  first paragraph, he notes that man himself is responsible for his immature status. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhtbwgaawdckdz9n2ybh3p5))


> After lingering over Kant’s text Foucault concludes the first half of his essay with the words:
>  I have been seeking to stress that the thread that may connect us with the Enlightenment is not
>  faithfulness to doctrinal elements, but rather the permanent reactivation of an attitude—that is, of a
>  philosophical ethos that could be described as a permanent critique of our historical era. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyhteb5t15zw90sm1xf2368r))
