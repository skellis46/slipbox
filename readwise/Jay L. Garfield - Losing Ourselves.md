> Candrakīrti (c. 600–650 CE) introduces us to the target of any critique of the idea of the self. He argues that it is important to keep that target clearly in view, and that it is important not to confuse it with other ideas in the conceptual neighborhood. Candrakīrti tells the story of a man who is afraid that a poisonous snake has taken up residence in one of the walls of his house. In order to alleviate his fear, the man searches the house for an elephant, and satisfies himself that there is none there. He then rests at ease.

> The Indian classic *Bhagavad Gītā (Song of the Lord)* characterizes the relation between the self and the embodied person as akin to that between you and your wardrobe. Each day you might put on a new set of clothes, but you are still you, the bearer of those clothes; you are not in any sense identical to them, and you are the same individual who put on different clothes yesterday and who may put on new ones tomorrow. Just so, according to the *Gītā,* you, the *ātman,* put on a new mind and body in each life, but are never identical to any mind or body; instead, you are the *bearer* of that mind and body, which are just as much objects to your subjectivity as any external phenomenon. [2.22][4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-4) Your mind and body are instruments by means of which you know and act on the world, and they are therefore distinct from that self that makes use of those instruments.

> And so, as we shall see when we turn to those arguments, the Buddhist position, and indeed any no-self position, must assume the burden of explaining both the apparent integration of consciousness at each moment and our perceived identity over time in the absence of a unitary subject and agent. In order to be successful, these no-self positions must show both that the idea of the self is incoherent and that everything that the self is meant to explain can be explained in its absence. That is, the proponent of the no-self view must show that everything that the self is meant to explain can actually be accomplished by a *person,* a socially embedded human being with no self.

> Those, like Hume and the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976),[5](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-5) who argue in the Western tradition against the existence of the self, have this Christian version in mind as their target.

> I will use the word *self* only to refer to this kind of self, reserving the word *person* to denote the complex, constructed, socially embedded psychophysical complexes in which I will argue we really consist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grjwkhp5n2f94gv5aqk7v48k))


> Descartes (1596–1650) famously argues in his *Meditations on First Philosophy* that we can be certain of our existence as *res cogitans,* or as *thinking things,* identical not with our bodies, or our perceptual faculties, but with our faculty of abstract reason.

> Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), defending a position very much like that of many of the orthodox Indian schools, argues in the *Critique of Pure Reason* that the self is a *noumenon,* a transcendental object existing outside of space and time, a pure subject or perceptual, conceptual, and aesthetic experience and agent of action, transcendentally free of the causal order.

> I suspect that the explanation of the self illusion is not cognitive, but is instead emotional, or even simply biological. There may be good evolutionary explanations of its origin, just as there are almost certainly good evolutionary explanations of how our visual system evolved to succumb to the Müller-Lyer illusion. Each of these may be, as the evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould called them, spandrels, or byproducts, of traits that have real survival value, even if being duped by these illusions has no survival value in itself.

> The ninth-century Indian philosopher Śāntideva argues in *How to Lead an Awakened Life* (*Bodhicāryāvatāra*) that our conviction that we are selves arises from a primal fear of death, and that we construct the idea of a self as a bulwark against that fear.[10](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-10) Śāntideva also argues that the idea that we are selves arises primarily in emotionally charged situations, as when we perceive that we have been harmed, or when pride is aroused. It is then that we think not of our minds or bodies, but of we who possess those minds and bodies. David Hume adopts a similar view. He argues that the thought that we are selves is a product of the passions—that we posit the self as the object of pride and humility, and then reify it in thought.[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter1-11) If anything like these analyses is right, the idea of self is grounded not in reason or perception, but in affect.

> I will present reasons to think that we are not selves. I take this task to be important, and not simply an abstract metaphysical inquiry. This is because the self illusion *matters.* It matters in part because it obscures our own identities from us, leading to a profound misunderstanding of who and what we are, and of the degree to which our own identities and existence are bound up with those of others. And it matters because it generates a perverse moral vision that engenders an instinctive attitude of self-interest and egoism that none of us can rationally endorse, and from which we would happily free ourselves.

> Instead, the author of the dialogue suggests, while the chariot exists, it does not exist as some singular entity that is either identical to or distinct from its parts. Its mode of existence is merely *conventional,* determined by our customs regarding the application of words like *this chariot*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grm2jb1w83zv18wzget6wwc9))


> And this, Nāgasena instructs the King, is how we should think of the *person* who is called Nāgasena and his relation to that name. He is no singular entity. He is neither identical to nor distinct from his parts. He is not the possessor of those parts. There is no single part with which he is identical. His existence is merely nominal. A final account of the basic constituents of the world, even were it to contain his hair, fingers, desires, and experiences, contains no Nāgasena.

> What, we might ask, is the status of the person who is no self? In particular, one might wonder, what accounts for the continuity of consciousness from one moment to the next, and the persistence of our identity through all of the changes we undergo in our lives if there is no self? Wouldn’t we exist even if there were no conventions? Isn’t our existence the *precondition* of any conventions? That is, we might ask, what exactly is the mode of existence that persons like us in fact enjoy?[2](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grm2q65bq0ebp54tdx0nwwdj))


> That question involves asking why the stages of me are all stages of *me*, and the stages of you are all stages of *you*, and why we never cross over. That is, we must account both for our own identities over time and for our difference from one another. These are questions about *continuity,* or *diachronic identity—identity over time*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmdt845fdxs5xx6rz4rjdyf))


> The second issue concerns *synchronic identity,* or *identity at a single time.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmdv6ffxcmtmqgnj5t4yxcj))


> My body and my psychological states are constantly changing, like the oil and lamps that support the flames. But, like those flames and those lamps, they constitute a causal sequence with a common function. And we have a convention of calling distinct members of such sequences by the same name. So, in one obvious sense, I am not *identical* to the person called by my name yesterday. We are *alike*, causally related, but numerically distinct. In another sense, though, we are the same person. We share a name, many properties, a causal history, and a social role; and that, while not involving a self, is enough.[4](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-4) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grncwpnggrk5mhtw2q0mb99x))


> We are, on this view, causally and cognitively open continua of psychophysical processes. No one of these processes by itself captures who we are; none persist unchanged over time; none are independent of the others. Together, they constitute our conventional identity, an identity we can now see to be very robust indeed. To put this another way, we do not stand over and against the world as isolated subjects; we do not act on the world as transcendent agents. Instead, we are embedded in the world as part of an interdependent reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grnd0094j9nka4nxjdz7m9e2))


> Nor does it make sense to say that the self is *different* from these sets of processes. For when we identify ourselves, or describe ourselves, we describe those very processes. How tall are you? You mention your body. How are you feeling? You mention your sensations. What kind of person are you? You mention your personality traits. If you take all of these away, though, there is nothing left: no bearer, no special entity that we recognize apart from our bodies, minds, and experiences. And when we introspect to find ourselves, all we find are our minds, bodies, and experiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grndm669hvq2xwk4m531nyhm))


> Candrakīrti argues that we are not selves, but *persons* (the Sanskrit term is *pudgala*). And the person, he argues, is neither identical to nor different from the psychophysical processes; but unlike the self, which is supposed to be an independently existent entity, there is no reason to believe that a person needs to exist in one of these ways. It is instead a socially constructed designation, posited on the bases of those processes, but not reducible to them (in a sense to be worked out in [chapter 3](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None)).[7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-7) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grndpn4w5904qr9xbtz5fgjq))


> Śāntideva endorses this analysis in *How to Lead an Awakened Life,* and he draws ethical consequences from it. He argues that the dualism of self and other underlies egocentricity. That egocentricity, in turn, leads to a strong sense of self-identity, which causes us to see ourselves as standing at the center of our own moral universes, and so as objects of special regard. He argues that this dualism derives in turn from self-grasping, from seeing the world in terms of the “I and mine” framework that derives from reifying ourselves as selves. He also argues that this is the source of the illusion that others are independent agents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grne4reqxsvjp03s9nqaj60m))


> That illusion, in turn, he argues, issues in two dysfunctional emotional sets. On the one hand, the attribution of independence leads to anger when others offend or wrong us. On the other hand, the sense that we are the sole authors of our own actions leads to egoistic pride in our own accomplishments. So, he suggests, the self illusion is not only an error regarding our mode of existence, but it is an error with disastrous moral results, disenabling true friendship, care, impartiality, and joy in others’ achievements. We will return to this issue in [chapter 7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grne5n115fd1g0c290vpp60c))


> In his *Treatise of Human Nature,* David Hume argues not only that we are not selves, but also that we don’t even have an *idea* of a self—that when we talk about selves, we are literally talking nonsense.[8](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-8) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0qg1bq8bczv0ak46229ne))


> A bit later in the section just quoted he says:
>  > For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call *myself,* I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch *myself* at any time without perception, and never can observe anything but the perception. [1.4.6.3] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0tnwgnebvanpsjm17ndec))


> Moreover, he points out [1.4.6.2], the collection that we find is not constant, but is always changing. There is nothing permanent in our experience. If this is so, Hume argues, when we use the word *self,* there is nothing to which it refers: we are nothing more than bundles of psychophysical processes—changing from moment to moment—who imagine ourselves to be more than that. Note, once again, this is not the absurd claim that we don’t exist, but rather the claim that the *way* we exist—as persons—is not the way that we normally take ourselves to exist—as selves.[9](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-9) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0wm4mryrh2hjtd5ke0gvg))


> After a number of decades, we might ask, “Is this the same church that was founded decades ago, or a different one?” [1.4.6.13] The parishioners are different; the minister is different; the bodies in the churchyard are different; the building is different. Nonetheless, since it makes sense to say, “This church is fifty years old,” in the most important sense, the church remains the same. So, while it is not some entity *different* from its parishioners, minister, building, etc., nor is it *identical* to them, it exists *conventionally,* and that is enough for it to be a real, functioning church. Once again, just so for persons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp0zgq932g1cc61rdy22kss))


> People instinctively regard themselves as selves in a very specific sense: they take themselves to persist through time as numerically identical subjects and agents, distinct from their minds, bodies, experiences, and traits. They do so even though they acknowledge that these minds, bodies, experiences, and traits are constantly changing and that they are only contingently connected to their selves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp12d9pjp2wxnpkh63vhm80))


> This is to say that people reflexively locate their identity not in their psychophysical characteristics, but in this hypostasized self. That is the serpent in the wall, and that is the target of Hume’s and Candrakīrti’s respective analyses. Neither of these two arguments suggests that we are nonexistent, any more than they suggest that chariots and churches are nonexistent; each instead addresses our *mode of existence*. That is, each suggests that it is irrational to claim that we exist as *selves* while affirming that we exist as *persons.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp13fgzy8nc9scgbbjp2rbx))


> We have encountered four principle conceptual ingredients to the idea of self: priority, unity, subject-object duality, and agency. That is, a self is meant to have a kind of existence *prior* to, or more fundamental than, that of body and mind; it is meant to be a unitary entity, not a multiplicity; it is that which is the subject of our cognitive objects, and so distinct from them; and it is the agent of action and the locus of responsibility.[11](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-11) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp1k6kfcf1ggnrzxm8qm9k8))


> This unity of the self, however, also grounds a duality: the duality of subject and object. We experience ourselves as subjects and everything else as objects, with a kind of distance between us and the world we experience. This duality so structures our naïve experience that it is hard to imagine that it is constructed, as opposed to natural. We take ourselves to be to the unseen seer, the reality known immediately in experience, the interior in which the external world is replicated and revealed in perception and in thought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grp1pzj97v2a0s6qdybmwxj2))


> When we experience external objects, we naturally take ourselves to perceive them just as they are, our experience functioning as an accurate representation of just what things look, sound, smell, taste, and feel like (unless we suspect sensory distortion for some reason). That is, we either take ourselves to be in direct, unmediated contact with the world as it is, or we take that world to be faithfully reproduced inside our consciousness, in a model that Dennett has aptly called “The Cartesian Theatre.”[14](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-14) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpm75rfs3y4mvzjzyexxtzw))


> the world we experience is not dually related to us, external to us, and independent, but one that we construct in our ongoing engagement with our environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmcsr908m8n0wkfthhnt6y))


> Each of these worlds is a construction, not a replication of a preexisting reality. None of these worlds has greater claim to reality than any other. So, the world we inhabit—just like the worlds of dogs, birds, and bees—is not a world we *encounter*, but a world in which we participate and which we *co-construct*.[16](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-16) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmdnmtvd95a7xyb949xacq))


> So, our awareness of the objects we encounter—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something other, dually related to ourselves—is in fact our nondual embeddedness in a world of which we are a part. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmfy80rx1frte12537tybh))


> In the same sense, our awareness of our subjective states—while it might present itself to naïve introspection as the experience of something immediately present, dually related to that which is other—is in fact just another aspect of our nondual embeddedness in that world. We participate in the construction of what we regard as external to us, and what is external to us participates in the construction of what we experience as the inner. In sum, the very dichotomy of self and other, inner and outer, is a construction, not a given. Much of our life is structured by the illusion that we just find what we in fact construct; but the fact that this illusion structures so much of our experience does not mean that it is not an illusion.

> Uncaused action, or random intentions are not only impossible, but also undesirable. Nonetheless, among the illusions for which we seem to be wired is the Augustinian illusion that our decisions to act are uncaused. This is part of the self illusion, for it reflects the assumption that we somehow, at least in part of our being, stand not within but outside of the world, and so are exempt from causal determinism. We will turn to the ethical dimensions of this illusion in [chapter 7](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#None). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmn65cxcdf9v65b9m56g1w))


> At the most basic level, the illusion of a self is the illusion that we stand outside of and against the world. We take ourselves pre-reflectively to be singularities: not participants in the world, but spectators of the world, and agents of actions directed on that world. This is what Wittgenstein’s metaphor of the relation of the eye to the visual field captures: the feeling that we as selves are not something in the world, but instead that we are the supramundane necessary conditions of its appearance to us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmr952zdm1e8en1yxtjqks))


> To my mind, that natural attitude of taking ourselves to be selves is a symptom of a profound instinct for self-alienation, and is the deepest form of what Buddhist philosophers call *primal confusion,* the root of suffering. We are, that is, wired to misunderstand our own mode of existence.[19](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-19) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmwy1bm9tw7s5faybqrrv0))


> Neuroscience does not reveal a central ego in the brain that marks who we *are,* as opposed to what we experience or do. There is no single place in the brain where it all “comes together,” or where consciousness is seated. Instead, neuroscientists focus on the patterns of activity that enable us to bind our experience into an experienced unity, patterns that allow us to self-identify, and that locate us in a spatiotemporal manifold along with our objects of experience. These processes are widely distributed in the brain, drawing on networks associated with perception, motor control, affect, conation, … ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmyc8gc0wvvnwsrc9dcsad))


> While the upshot of these processes, as Metzinger puts it, is an illusion, or a model, of a self,[20](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter2-20) they hardly *constitute* a self any more than *Moby-Dick* brings Captain Ahab into real existence. To think that they do is to confuse the serpent in the wall with the nonexistent elephant in the room. This is because the patterns that the most plausible current neuroscientific models identify involve the large-scale coordination of neural activity connecting widely disparate parts of the brain. These include areas associated with proprioception, interoception, perception, language, motor control, long-term and semantic memory, working memory, and so forth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpmzqg6g0nj3fqhx407a080))


> All of this is to say that we are many, not one; we are collections of collections of processes, not unities; we are more like hives than bees in that respect. We are of the world, not over and against it. We are dynamic and constantly changing causally interdependent systems of processes, not independent, enduring objects or agents.

> To be a person is to play a role; the person you are is constituted by the multiple roles you play, including family roles, professional roles, roles in networks of friends, and political roles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpn50atr7rkyqxg8c424rjs))


> The relationship between a fiction and the characters it creates is thus double-edged, reflecting the curious and often overlooked fact that the words *fact* and *fiction* are cognate, sharing the Latin root *fingere—*to *make*, or to *fashion*. Fictions create facts. And this means *both* that the contents of fiction are *creations,* not mind-independent realities, *and* that nonetheless there is truth and falsity with respect to them, truth and falsity constituted by the very act of their creation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpr0mq6s26jt1zv6aqfxspn))


> The point of this analogy is thus that to be a person is to be something like Hamlet, not to be like the actor playing Hamlet. Hamlet requires an actor to be instantiated—to be brought to life on the stage—as well as a literary context and a set of theatrical conventions that enable that instantiation or enlivening. In the same sense, we require bodies and collections of psychophysical processes to bring us to life on the stages in which we fret and strut our particular hours (to mix Shakespearean plays) as well as a social context and set of conventions that enable us to be recognized not merely as live human bodies, but as persons among persons. To the extent that we are single characters over our lifetime, we are, like Hamlet, played by a succession of actors: an infant; a toddler; a schoolchild; finally, with any luck, an elder.

> There is at least one important difference between Hamlet and one of us: our lines are not written in advance, and our characters are performed in the context of an improv show, not a scripted play. This is important because independence is at the core of the idea of the self, and as we discard *that* idea, one further myth worth discarding is the myth that we ever stand on our own two feet. Instead, our identity is forged only partly by the actors who perform the roles in which our identities consist: we are not performed by solo actors in a stand-up club, but in a vast improv group including friends, family, colleagues, and fellow citizens. Who we are reflects the way our role fits into this indefinitely large, unbounded human drama. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grpr2tvcd9ean7v93ypvs2s6))


> That is the sense in which we have a *personal* identity, and it is a very real sense, a fact brought into life through our collective narrative and enactive agency: the *personae* that populate our drama are created, not discovered. Our identity endures through change, however, not because we are entities separate from the institutions, relations, narratives, and embodiment that bring us into existence. On the contrary, it endures precisely because of those very institutions, relations, narratives, and in virtue of that very embodiment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grprahcyq26dcawb65e314g0))


> And the self that we instinctively grasp and that plays this deep psychological role is *not* the person we have just characterized. The self is taken to be preexistent, primordial, unitary, and transcendent of the world of objects, independent of body, mind, and social context. The person is constructed; the person is dependent on the psychophysical and social network in which it is realized; the person is complex, embodied and embedded. That is the difference between the actor and the role. We are roles, not actors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grprgfspkxcqqjjspqbghes9))


> Here are three of the most important, seductive, and pernicious of those myths:

> Interdependence can thus be a source of misery as well as of joy; of despair as well as of gratitude. This does not, however, mean that we can escape it. Interdependence is a fact of life; and our identity as persons is a consequence of that interdependence, for good and for ill.
