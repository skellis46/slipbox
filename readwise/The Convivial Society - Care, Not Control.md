## Highlights

> *Resist the temptation to confuse control for care.*
>  Implicit in how digital technologies are often marketed is the promise of greater control as if it were equivalent to greater care. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4nj8pcsc4jf2fqmw60jfm89))


> I chose the word *control* because it captures a wide array of possible practices and technologies. The promise of control might be expressed, for example, through technologies that offer the possibility of improved data-gathering, planning, monitoring, calibration, customization, scheduling, outsourcing, security, or documentation. In each case, we are encouraged to reduce the skill of caring—either in the sense of taking an interest in or looking out for the welfare of another—to one of these various forms of technological mediation. Technologically mediated expressions of control also suggest relationships of distance and detachment rather than presence and involvement, which can in turn imply a certain evasion of the risk and obligations that care can entail.

> But these technologies do not *see* students. And sadly, *we* do not see students. This is cultural. This is institutional. We do not see who is struggling. And let’s ask why we think, as the *New York Times* argued today, we need big data to make sure students graduate. Universities have not developed or maintained practices of compassion. Practices are technologies; technologies are practices. We’ve chosen computers instead of care. (When I say “we” here I mean institutions not individuals within institutions. But I mean some individuals too.) Education has chosen “command, control, intelligence.” Education gathers data about students. It quantifies students. It has adopted a racialized and gendered surveillance system – one that committed to disciplining minds and bodies – through our education technologies, through our education practices.

> For my part, I try to remember that …
>  surveillance does not equal care.
>  surveillance cannot guarantee safety.
>  surveillance will not alleviate anxiety.
>  surveillance cannot substitute for presence.
>  surveillance can undermine trust and responsibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4njs4chhz97g0q043j2gk1j))
