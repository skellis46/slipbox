## Highlights

> But exclusion gave way to shallow representation of African Americans in politics and the private sector as evidence of color blindness and progress. The rooms where decisions were being made were no longer entirely white and male; they were now punctuated with token representations of race and gender.

> Táíwò, a professor of philosophy at Georgetown, published his first book earlier this year. Titled “[Reconsidering Reparations](https://www.amazon.com/Reconsidering-Reparations-PHILOSOPHY-Ol-C3-BAfhemi-T-C3-A1-C3-ADw-C3-B2-dp-0197508898/dp/0197508898?ots=1&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50),” it argues that, if colonialism and slavery were responsible for the maldistribution of wealth and resources that has made Black and brown people particularly vulnerable to today’s climate crisis, then the repair should be just as expansive or capable of remaking the world. In 2020, Táíwò wrote several essays critiquing the variety of ways that the concept of “identity politics” has been transformed from a radical invention of the Black feminist left of the sixties and seventies into a placid appeal to racial and gender representation. The themes of these essays have now been spun into a tight, short volume published by Haymarket Books, titled “[Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (and Everything Else)](https://www.amazon.com/Elite-Capture-Powerful-Identity-Everything/dp/1642596884?ots=1&tag=thneyo0f-20&linkCode=w50).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsf3yefgc59mzekwdmdxp1cm))


> Táíwò begins his examination of identity politics with the Combahee River Collective, a group of Black lesbian socialists that formed in the late nineteen-seventies. Among them were Demita Frazier and the twin sisters Barbara and Beverly Smith, who wrote the [Combahee River Statement](https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/combahee-river-collective-statement-1977/), in which they coined the term “identity politics.” The women were veterans of the antiwar and feminist movements but also connected to the civil-rights movement and Black-liberation struggles of the era. In their wide range of experiences, the issues of importance to them—namely organizing against forced sterilizations and intimate-partner violence against women—were rarely taken seriously by others, including Black men and white women.

> In this way, standpoint epistemology, or the ability to acquire knowledge because of your lived experience or social standing, is closely linked to the Combahee’s vision of identity politics. It was a powerful rejection of the status quo in the social sciences, which for many years had relied upon powerful outsiders, typically white men, to extoll their own wisdom about the lives of the marginalized, excluded, and oppressed. The powerful social movements of the era swept aside the common sense of white-male authority, transforming the marginalized from examined objects into subjects capable of controlling their own destiny.

> Nevertheless, as Táíwò writes, “treating such elites’ interests as necessarily or even presumptively aligned with the broader group’s interests involves a political naivete we cannot afford.” This confusion then “functions as a form of racial Reaganomics: a strategy reliant on fantasies about the exchange rate between the attention economy and the material economy.” Táíwò adds that we need to “fix the social structure itself—the rooms we interact in, and the house they make up. Deference, as a strategy, bears at best a tenuous relationship to this goal.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfqtzkpt66dnmy1pyg60bxr))


> And if our aim is simply to do better than the epistemic norms that we’ve inherited from a history of explicit global apartheid, that is an awfully low bar to set.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfqxq8gxpya3bxat4d7w682))


> He says, of traumatic experience, “It is not what gives me a special right to speak, to evaluate, or to decide for a group. It is a concrete, experiential manifestation of the vulnerability that connects me to most of the people on this earth. It comes between me and other people not as a wall, but as a bridge.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfqzdymx0jn47jcvqz9750q))


> In an interview, [Barbara Smith](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/until-black-women-are-free-none-of-us-will-be-free), of the Combahee River Collective, once talked about the importance of the idea of a bridge as a way to overcome difference, saying that the notion of, “ ‘If I don’t have a particular identity, I’m not allowed to work on a particular issue’—that sounds to me like an excuse. That sounds to me like O.K., so that’s what somebody decides if they’re not really willing to go there, and go through the struggle of crossing boundaries and working across differences.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfr0vrv7154dn23j7y6mc02))


> We must find the ties that bind us together, to see how our oppressions are linked, to build bridges to each other’s struggles and find ways to unite. This is the opposite of élite capture; it is a remaking of the world. As Táíwò, echoing Marx, reminds us, the point, after all, is to change it. ♦ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsfr231x7yzwpkdzrhqvke7s))
