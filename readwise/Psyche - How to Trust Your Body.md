> When it comes to decision-making and health, people differ in how much importance they place on bodily sensations – from hunger and fatigue to anger and joy. Some of us might dismiss or suppress sensations, talk ourselves out of a strong feeling (or let others talk us out of it), or simply place more importance on logic and rationality than on feeling. People also differ in how well they can sense these signals, which affects their ability to make use of them. For example, people with [alexithymia](https://psyche.co/ideas/dark-feelings-will-haunt-us-until-they-are-expressed-in-words), a condition marked by difficulty identifying and articulating feelings, often don’t know they’re hungry until they’re in pain, or that they’re angry until they feel their pulse. On the other end of the spectrum are those people who arguably feel too much, leading them to become easily overwhelmed by – and therefore distrustful of – their bodily signals.

> Body trust is not just a folk concept – it’s also a scientific construct. It’s used to measure ‘interoception’, which is the [process](https://psyche.co/ideas/the-brains-reading-of-the-bodys-state-is-key-to-mental-health) of sensing the body from within. Poor interoception is associated with a wide range of mental disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disorders, depression and anxiety. Alongside questions about body trust, researchers measure people’s interoception by tapping seven further features, from ‘noticing’ to ‘attention regulation’ to ‘body listening’. Of these features, ‘low body trust’ has emerged as particularly relevant to mental health. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpn1qe62ms3x993kedtbfvay))
