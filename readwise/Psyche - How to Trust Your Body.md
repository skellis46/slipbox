## Highlights

> When it comes to decision-making and health, people differ in how much importance they place on bodily sensations – from hunger and fatigue to anger and joy. Some of us might dismiss or suppress sensations, talk ourselves out of a strong feeling (or let others talk us out of it), or simply place more importance on logic and rationality than on feeling. People also differ in how well they can sense these signals, which affects their ability to make use of them. For example, people with [alexithymia](https://psyche.co/ideas/dark-feelings-will-haunt-us-until-they-are-expressed-in-words), a condition marked by difficulty identifying and articulating feelings, often don’t know they’re hungry until they’re in pain, or that they’re angry until they feel their pulse. On the other end of the spectrum are those people who arguably feel too much, leading them to become easily overwhelmed by – and therefore distrustful of – their bodily signals.

> Body trust is not just a folk concept – it’s also a scientific construct. It’s used to measure ‘interoception’, which is the [process](https://psyche.co/ideas/the-brains-reading-of-the-bodys-state-is-key-to-mental-health) of sensing the body from within. Poor interoception is associated with a wide range of mental disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), eating disorders, depression and anxiety. Alongside questions about body trust, researchers measure people’s interoception by tapping seven further features, from ‘noticing’ to ‘attention regulation’ to ‘body listening’. Of these features, ‘low body trust’ has emerged as particularly relevant to mental health. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpn1qe62ms3x993kedtbfvay))

> Since changing the way I think about internal experience, and cutting out alcohol from my life completely, I feel calm the majority of the time. But to reach that state, I’ve had to change the way I think about my feelings – to treat my internal experience with the same consideration I give to vision, hearing or any other sense.

> Although it’s early days for research into interoception, one thing that has been [found](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01504/full) to improve it, as well as body trust, is mindfulness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpnqafc8zdxzfrhmg47mreyz))

>  > When we live outside ourselves, and by that I mean on external directives only rather than from our internal knowledge and needs, when we live away from those … guides from within ourselves, then our lives are limited by external and alien forms, and we conform to the needs of a structure that is not based on human need, let alone an individual’s.

> ‘Our bodies are designed in a way to feel uncomfortable at times,’ the occupational therapist and interoception expert Kelly Mahler wrote on her blog in 2021. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpnqgc8brrm52tmxmv4na158))


> Rather than focusing your attention on one particular thing – such as the breath, or a specific body part – open monitoring is about noticing whatever arises into your field of awareness, moment by moment, and just observing it without judgment.

> Later in the Guide, I will explain ways to interact with your sensations, such as via labelling or by reappraising them, but first it’s important to practise disidentifying from sensation, to have that buffer of nonjudgment in place.

> Jonathan Gibson [suggested](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6753170/) that open monitoring could be particularly helpful for emotional self-regulation because of the space it creates between you and your feelings. ‘It is a recognition that one is having an experience rather than “being” the experience,’ Gibson explained. ‘Bodily sensations can simply be experienced rather than transform the experience into a self-defining attribute.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gps90amwkx024sk82bpd4vap))


> In other words: when it comes to anxiety, it’s not what’s going on inside your body that is the problem; it’s what you *think* *about* what’s going on inside your body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwtd63ydagwr2hhhssdh9d2))


> Changing what you think about how you feel is called ‘reappraisal’ and it’s another component of building body trust. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwtcw6vdx4f3y9amvsnpbkj))


> To practise reappraisal, ask yourself the following:
>  • Is this sensation inherently good or bad?
>  • What do I usually think when I feel this sensation?
>  • What is my body trying to tell me? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpwtdjnv16szcmmtqjff9h1y))


> Your feelings do not always reflect what’s true of *the situation*, despite the fact that your feelings are always valid *for you*. It’s essential to be able to make space between reaction and reality, because you will change your behaviour (and thereby your reality) based on what you believe to be the state of things.

> Social interoception, in particular, may prove to be an especially promising line of research, as it frames bodily experience as relational in the same way, for example, that [relational psychotherapy](https://psyche.co/ideas/for-donald-winnicott-the-psyche-is-not-inside-us-but-between-us) frames psychology as intersubjective. In other words: if people first learn emotional self-regulation through their bodies, and through interactions with other people, then perhaps the key to improved regulation in adulthood lies as much in the wilderness of interpersonal interactions as it does in the individual will to change.
