> Convergent thinking involves the synthesizing of a range of ideas, allowing students to take a collection of facts and examples and make sense of it all. This type of thinking occurs when a student explains, interprets, summarizes, compares, and contrasts—all forms of intellectual activity aimed at pulling things together.7 ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=408))

> The RQI Question Formulation Technique™ • Produce Your Own Questions • Improve Your Questions • Prioritize Your Questions Produce Your Questions Four essential rules for producing your own questions: • Ask as many questions as you can. • Do not stop to discuss, judge or answer the questions. • Write down every question exactly as it is stated. • Change any statement into a question. Improve Your Questions Categorize the questions as closed- or open-ended: • Closed-ended questions: They can be answered with yes or no or with one word. • Open-ended questions: They require an explanation and cannot be answered with yes or no or with one word.

> Question Focus: A stimulus for jumpstarting student questions. It can be a short statement or a visual or aural aid in any medium or format that can stimulate student thinking that will be expressed through their questions. It is the opposite of using a teacher’s question to prompt student thinking ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=600))

> Ask, “How are the rules different from the way we usually work?” • Pick one or more rules and ask, “How can these rules help you produce questions? What do you see that is different in following this rule? ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=1013))

> Peet noted that she had always thought of her classroom as a student-centered one. But after seeing the way her students responded to the opportunity to generate their own questions, she realized that there is something fundamentally different about students responding to a teacher’s question to encourage thinking—no matter how well constructed—versus students getting the chance to generate their own questions. Her students noticed the difference as well. ([Location 1161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=1161))

> Students ask for examples: Do not give examples. Repeat: Do not give examples. When you give examples you are setting direction for the questions. Students need to struggle with this a bit. If they are completely stuck, you can use question starters. For example: “You can start a question with words like what, when, or how. Use one of these words to produce a question about [our QFocus].” Questions starters will be a good strategy for when students are stuck or when they have produced very few questions.

> Questions can be classified as being of different types and for different purposes; for information gathering, analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and comprehension. They can be classified as higher- or lower-order, thick or thin, factual, rhetorical, hypothetical, etc. ([Location 1330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=1330))

> Open-ended questions start with Why? and How? • Closed-ended questions start with Is?, Do?, and Can? • Words that could be used for both types of questions: What?, Who?, Where?, and When? ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=1458))

> Just asking or hearing a question phrased a certain way produces an almost palpable feeling of discovery and new understanding. Questions, more than any other utterance, have a particularly powerful influence: they produce the “light-bulb” effect. It is no surprise, then that even the greatest thinkers spend their days trying to figure out what questions to ask ([Location 2071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00ELV5Y5A&location=2071))

> Because the other students will start worrying if you don’t say the exact same thing to them, and that will stop them from asking more questions. I now use the neutral “Thank you” to acknowledge every student comment. They look at me like it’s weird at first, but I’ve had students tell me they really, really like it because they’re usually waiting for the teacher to tell them they did it right or they wind up feeling bad.

> The cognitive psychologist Robert Sternberg, who has done pioneering work on how to broaden and enrich assessment of student achievement, has recently made precisely that point in an analysis of the problematic measures used in college admissions. He believes that schools do indeed need to teach students how to ask questions because “if we always give students the questions, and demand only the answers, we teach them to answer prefabricated questions rather than to ask questions worth asking.
