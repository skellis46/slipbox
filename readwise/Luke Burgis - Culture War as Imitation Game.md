> The French social theorist René Girard, born in 1923, is not quite yet a household name, but his work does occasionally make it into popular culture. Take the second season of the hit HBO show *The* *White Lotus*, where one main character suggests that his friend and former romantic rival has “a bad case of mimetic desire.” This would have made Girard laugh, since his theory partly explains how ideas become fashionable.

> Mimetic desire was Girard’s central idea. It is the notion that humans don’t generate their own desires but rather mimic the desires of others — and that this is at the root of human conflict. Mimetic desire formed the basis for a theory of history and culture that captivated his students and thousands of scholars across disciplines as diverse as literature, sociology, philosophy, theology, and history.

> It always starts small. Consider the following example. Ten toddlers turned loose in a room full of toys will often converge on just one of them after one child shows enough interest in it. That initial interest could be for a variety of reasons: maybe the little girl picked up the red fire truck because her dad is a firefighter. But her fixation with that toy will soon draw others in. The children will then reinforce one another’s desire until they begin fighting over it — even before most of them know what the toy does. Before long, the toy no longer matters; the game of who gets to play with it does.
>  This, Girard believed, is what adults do in a far more sophisticated way. Because we learn to want what other people want, “rivalry exists at the very heart of human social relations.” Girard wrote those words in his most explicitly theological work, *I See Satan Fall Like Lightning* (1999), in which he traces this phenomenon all the way back to the earliest pages of the Bible. The first woman, Eve, does not have the desire to eat the forbidden fruit on her own — it is suggested, or modeled, to her by the serpent.

> As more and more of the protestors provided a model for breaching the Capitol, not only did it become easier to do so — it became easier to *want* to do so. This is the crux of Girard’s theory: In the final analysis, all action begins with a process of desire. Understanding that mysterious process was his life’s work. When he studied ancient stoning rituals, Girard was fascinated by the question of why the first stone thrown was so important — consider how ingrained in the Western mind is the phrase “casting the first stone.” His answer: because it is the only stone without a model. When you are able to notice the models of desire exerting force in a given situation, many things begin to make more sense.

> Girard identified two kinds of mimetic models: external and internal. External models are those outside of our immediate world — for instance, celebrities (the Kardashians), historical figures (Rosa Parks), or fictional characters (Ted Lasso). Here, imitation can only go one way. A soccer coach can try to channel the “Ted Lasso Way,” but Ted Lasso will not be influenced by the coach. There is no possibility of reciprocal desires taking shape.
>  Internal models of desire are inside of our world, and so the imitation *can* become reciprocal. There is the possibility of escalation. This, in my view, is the most dangerous thing that social media has done to our collective psyche and the reason why mimetic rivalry is so widespread today. Nearly overnight, the Internet put us all inside one another’s heads as internal models of desire — whether positively or negatively.

> Girard used one of his most evocative phrases in referring to the mimetic dynamics at work in politics. In his first book, *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel* (1961), he referred to the great writer Stendhal, who grew up in the turmoil following the French Revolution. Stendhal must have seen the mimetic mechanism at work in the politics of the time, and became what Girard called an “atheist in politics.” With this phrase, Girard did not mean politics founded on atheism but rather a stance that refuses to place one’s faith in — refuses to idolize — any one political actor, system, or party. Stendhal, Girard said, demythologized and desacralized the politics of his day, exposing the French nobility’s petty rivalries and ridiculous preoccupations, the mimetic logic that binds people to their enemies.

> Girard saw in the crucifixion a mechanism that he argued has been present throughout recorded history under different forms: the scapegoat mechanism, a mysterious rite first alluded to in the book of Leviticus when the high priest would draw lots to choose which of two goats to sacrifice in the temple. The other goat, the scapegoat, would have the sins of the people ritually transferred onto it, and it would then be driven out of the town and into the desert, carrying the sins of the people along with it.

> There is no such a thing as “good violence” and “bad violence,” Girard emphasized. If we believe in the righteousness of our own violence — or of our side — it is always what we think of as the “good” kind. It is this belief, Girard said, that allowed scapegoating violence to perpetuate throughout history. And it is this belief that the political atheist must reject.

> More and more, it seems to me,” Girard wrote, “modern individualism assumes the form of a desperate denial of the fact that, through mimetic desire, each of us seeks to impose his will upon his fellow man, whom he professes to love but more often despises.”
>  Imposing our will on another is war. Attempting to win over hearts and minds is, or at least should be, a democracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6nc3sgjhrphj0qtr37g2sz8))
