## Highlights

> We are all – or nearly all – honourable, well-meaning people who wish the best for the children in our care. But we can’t all be right. Should we go back to the past, to strict discipline and three-hour written exams, to hard subjects like Latin and algebra that train children’s minds in the arts of rationality and retention? Or should we push on to a new future of demanding project work and self-expression, collaboration and problem-solving, continuous assessment and portfolios?

> They are much more at home with the kind of intelligence that the great psychologist Jean Piaget described as “knowing ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=408))

> what to do when you don’t know what to do”. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=409))

> All the evidence shows that learning any particular thing, be it Grand Theft Auto or Latin, makes you better at that thing, but unless you are taught in a very particular way (more on this later), the benefits do not automatically transfer to any other domain. In fact, this is true for every subject on the secondary school curriculum. If taught in the traditional way, they do not make you any better at general-purpose thinking.

> This emphasis on just knowing, and its associated feeling of being securely right, is deeply characteristic of Trads. They seem to greatly prefer knowing to thinking. They like to be certain, and to defend their certainty with any rhetorical tricks they can muster. ([Location 448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=448))

> A definition of ‘intelligence’, endorsed by 52 leading experts in the field, specifically cautions: “Intelligence is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. It reflects a broader and deeper capability for … ‘catching on’, ‘making sense’ of things, and ‘figuring out’ what to do.” ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=455))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> Because Trads like to keep things simple, they reduce knowledge to facts (and ignore the fact that most knowledge actually consists of webs of ideas that have withstood empirical tests). They reduce the subtle art of teaching to ‘knowledge transmission’ – just telling. ([Location 473](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=473))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> They like to make assessment as rigorous as possible by making everything right or wrong – which, of course, ignores thinking. And they have a simplistic view of students’ minds which revolves around memorising: putting facts into storage and hauling them out on demand. This world view obliterates much of what is interesting and true about the mind as something which grapples with ideas, copes with degrees of uncertainty, interprets and muses – and sometimes improves – on what it has read or heard and, critically, is capable of getting better at grappling, interpreting, musing and, indeed, memorising. ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=475))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> Novices don’t, so they have to be filled up with facts before they become capable of thinking. Which means the attempt to get children wrestling with problems they are not yet ‘expert’ about is ‘progressive nonsense’. But both understanding and skill grow precisely by working at the limit of what you currently can do or know. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=490))

> Any parent knows that children’s most powerful learning tools are questioning and thinking, not memorising and regurgitating. ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=495))

> Dweck has been able to show that there are two broad categories of learners. One she calls ‘fixed mindset’ and the other ‘growth mindset’. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=559))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> By contrast, there are other children who believe that their brains are more like muscles; they get stronger and smarter through exercise. So they like it when they have to think and try hard, because they see this as mental exercise and an opportunity to get smarter. They see their ability as expandable rather than predetermined. Here’s the kicker: children who have growth mindsets consistently outperform their classmates on public examinations and are generally better at doing all the things that successful people tend to do (e.g. managing their emotions, coming up with creative ideas, having a go at new things). ([Location 562](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=562))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> Those who believe that they can get smarter normally can, if they try. Which of these two groups would you want your child to be in? ([Location 567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=567))

> Feedback like this is known as ‘person praise’; that’s to say it focuses on the individual rather than on what they have actually done to contribute to the grade achieved. ([Location 573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=573))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> The most useful thing that parents and teachers can do is to give learners accurate, specific feedback on things they have done, especially noting where they have shown particular initiative or spent extra time on some aspect of an assignment. ([Location 576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=576))

> Why? Because we learn most when we are pushing ourselves, not merely staying within our comfort zone, but exerting ourselves to try something more challenging or adventurous. ([Location 579](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=579))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> It follows that schools which understand the power of a growth mindset will, paradoxically, see making mistakes (interesting, not just slipshod) as something to be encouraged. If you visit such schools, as we do, you will see some subtle differences. For example, in assemblies, as well as celebrating the successes of the First XI, groups of students who have gone the extra mile and really put in effort are routinely acknowledged. In classrooms it is common to have work in progress – warts and all – on display, as well as beautifully mounted examples of final ‘products’.

> The willingness to venture and tinker are as vital to real-world achievement as any innate talent or intelligence you might possess. ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=586))

> Schooling is expensive so, of course, there needs to be a separate stream for ‘the brightest and the best’ – thus defined – that runs from grammar and independent schools through to Oxford and Cambridge. But the static, fixed view of intelligence or ‘ability’ on which this reasoning rests is wrong. Children’s apparent intelligence varies hugely from context to context, and depends on all kinds of factors – like their beliefs about intelligence – which have nothing to do with any innate ability.

> Exams ought to do a reasonable job of predicting how someone actually functions in some context in the future. If they don’t, they just become self-referring and self-serving. ([Location 1004](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=1004))

> A great Russian psychologist, Lev Vygotsky, discovered long ago that (to paraphrase a little) minds are contagious: we pick up mental habits and attitudes from the people we hang out with. Minds rub off on each other, especially when we are young. ([Location 1095](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=1095))

> Bluntly, you can teach the Tudors in a way that develops the habits of independence, imagination, empathy and debate; or you can teach them in a way that develops passivity, compliance, credulity and memorisation. You can teach the water cycle in a way that stretches students’ ability to dig deep in their learning and ask good questions; or you can teach it in a way that makes them dependent on their teacher and frightened of making mistakes.

> There are broadly three clusters of these character strengths that are (a) predictive of success in life and (b) capable of being cultivated by schools. The first is called rather grandly ‘self-regulation’. It is the cluster of habits that enable you to concentrate despite distractions; to stay engaged despite being frustrated; to make short-term sacrifices in the interest of longer term gains; and to deal with frustration or disappointment. (‘Self-soothing’ is the fancy word for this last capacity.) ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00VDHFS56&location=1117))

> We have heard of one brave school where every term the children are each given a ‘joker’ they can play at any point of any lesson during that term. When they do so, the teacher has to stop teaching and try to give the class their best explanation of why that topic is important enough to be taking up the children’s time.

> Fixed mindset learners like to prove what they can do and tend to be averse to risk (you might look stupid) and hard work (struggling means you aren’t very bright). Growth mindset children are all about improving what they can do. They don’t mind in the least that, in the course of getting better at things, they make mistakes, struggle and don’t look good.

> The process of science is little different from the deeply resonant, natural processes of play. Play enables us to discover and create relationships and patterns … This is science: the process that enables one to reveal previously unseen patterns of relationship … But, because the outcome of all such [enquiry] is unpredictable, supporting this ‘messyness’, which is the engine of science, is critical to good science education (and indeed creative education generally) … We have learned that doing ‘real science’ can stimulate tremendous interest in children in understanding the processes by which we make sense of the world.

> Whether by teaching children how to function in a research team or through a technique known as ‘jigsaw’, it is possible to take young learners to the next level in their journey to becoming really effective learners. (Jigsaw learning organises large enquiries into component sub-tasks to be carried out by different groups, and then requires each group to collaborate with the others. A simple example would be writing, designing, printing and distributing a class newspaper which will call on groups to take on the different interdependent functions of a real newspaper.)

> “What do you think is going to happen?” You can’t ask that about the periodic table.) Many pupils never become fluent in this more abstract-but-precise way of thinking and writing, and nor do they master the art of sliding between the language of concrete, personally felt experience and the abstract languages of academic research – but they could, and it would be socially highly useful for them to do so.

> Central to our pedagogy is the notion of choice. Currently youngsters are given choices about how they learn, where they learn and how they present their learning. As we develop, we will be offering choices about what youngsters learn and about the length of time they spend on their learning.
