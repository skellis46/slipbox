> Cardiovascular interoception is central to research on interoception, and is considered to be a precursor to other branches of interoceptive research due to its methodological and theoretical characteristics. The publications in this area are correspondingly numerous. The monograph by Vaitl and Schandry (1995) provides a good overview. Today, six principle areas of research can be differentiated: (1) Representation of cardiovascular processes in the central nervous system (2) Behavior control through cardiovascular afferents (3) Cardiac perception (4) Psychopathology of heart beat perception (5) Cardioception and regulation of physical load (6) Cardiac nociception ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx372c694f196m09eb17hv2))

> (a) Questionnaires are instruments distant from the process. The least accurate instruments are, for example, questionnaires pertaining to bodily perception (exam- ple: Autonomic Perception Questionnaire, APQ, Mandler et al., 1958; overview on other questionnaires, see Weitkunat, 1987). These questionnaires give an indication of the judgements of subjects about their interoceptive capabilities; a correlation with physiologically measurable parameters usually is not found.

> We therefore need a repertoire of research tools that includes not only non-verbal methods, but moreover, we need methods that can investigate types of bodily responses that are beyond of explicit knowledge and cannot be processed and reported verbally (for example, by means of experimental approaches and designs to assess discrimination learning).

> Re- search on interoception could show that the crucial influences which determine the psychopathology are, if anywhere, to be seen in insufficient or inconsistent, and not in improved interoception.
>  In terms of the psychology of perception, we see a dominance of response bias over sensitivity. This knowledge should provide incen- tive and challenge in research on interoception to search for methods which are not based on verbal responses, and which are constructed nearer to the behavior of the individual, that is, which rely more on the implicit knowledge of the body than on explicit knowledge.
