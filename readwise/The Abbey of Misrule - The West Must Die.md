## Highlights

> To McGilchrist, the Western way of seeing - a way of seeing that was always going to give birth to something like the Machine - is rooted in the brain itself, and our very particular way of relating to the world can be seen, from some angles, as almost a form of mental illness. Our minds are, he suggests, unable to see the world in its fullness because our culture has trained them - or been trained by them - to see the world as an object and not a living thing. The consequence - in my words, not his - has been the emergence of the Machine and its values. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22cvrx7mhnw8711raa1hd09))


> The left and right hemispheres seem to have very specific ways of relating to their world. The left’s way is the way of certainty, manipulation, detail, the local and familiar, the isolated, discrete and fragmentary. Its world is fixed, decontextualised, inanimate, general and optimistic. The right, on the other hand, sees the whole picture, notices the peripheries and is comfortable with the global, new, ambiguous, circumspect and complex. It attends to change, flow, context, the animate, narratives, the pragmatic, empathy and emotional expressivity, and it tends towards pessimism.

> The upshot is that, says McGilchrist, ‘we no longer live in the *presence* of the world, but rather in a *re-presentation* of it.’ There is no territory in this new world, there is only map. Those who can see this, and try to point it out, are dismissed as ‘romantics’, ‘nostalgics’, ‘reactionaries’ or ‘dreamers’. The left hemisphere’s world is taken to be reality, whereas it is, in fact, only an inadequate representation of it. The result, says McGilchrist, is an age that is literally unprecedented in human history: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22cyh7bgg7j3mkvdd9ga0b0))


> *We exist in the world, of course, but we no longer* belong *in this world - or any world worthy of the name. We have unmade the world. This is entirely new in the history of humanity and it is impossible to exaggerate its significance.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22cz3aqpdp47pjsm2axe1rg))

> This is what we do, here in ‘the West’: we break things. We break systems and traditions, cultures and forests. We split atoms and bust through the upper atmosphere. We break the bounds between species and sexes, we blur the lines between life and death. Our great revolution has unleashed untold energy and created miracles, but now we can see where it is going. The modern revolution, the Machine revolution, is the left hemisphere’s work. There is a kind of greatness to it, and a certain tragedy. Most of today’s ‘defenders of the West’ are defending aspects of this revolution. They will defend empire, science, rationality, progress and nuclear fission until the cows come home. They are revolutionaries themselves, even if they call themselves conservatives. But the West’s left-brain revolution will end up destroying us, and the world, if we let it.

> McGilchrist would tell us that we should start by changing our quality of attention. This may sound nebulous, but it is anything but. If our left-hemisphere-dominated minds cause us to pay attention to the world in one way, then we need to train them, bit by it, to pay attention in another. ‘Attention changes the world’, he writes. ‘How you attend to it changes what it is you find there.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h22d4keczwa6b8b6egnbf02d))


> What would this mean in practice? I think we know already. It would mean attending to the ways of seeing that were central to past cultures, but that Western modernity relentlessly dismisses or downplays as unprofitable, unrealistic, romantic and all the rest. Perhaps central to this is an effort to see the world as an organism rather than a mechanism, and then to express it that way, through art, through creativity, through writing, through our conversations. The last part is the hardest, very often, but maybe the most important too. If we refuse to see the world or its inhabitants as machines, if we are suspicious of rationalisations and dogmatic insistence and easy answers and false divisions, even for a moment, we are making a start.
