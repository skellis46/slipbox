> activation of interoceptive representations and meta-representations of bodily signals supporting interoceptive awareness are profoundly associated with emotional experience and cognitive functions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ztdym4nyfqb0vdagr0t861))


> While it is well known that bodily responding and its perception are key processes in the construction of emotion experience, the fact that bodily processes might be of enormous importance for many more psychological functions, including cognition or decision making, is quite new. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zva3qg02r9vmcpbxwnvkm6))


> As a general concept “interoception” includes two forms of perception: proprioception (signals form skin and musculoskeletal apparatus) and visceroception (signals from the inner organs). A conventional view of interoception held that feelings of visceral and vasomotor activity, hunger, thirst, and other internal sensations were less distinct and less well discriminated and thus different from those that have been associated with the “exteroceptive,” somatosensory system such as pain and itch or temperature. Today, there is evidence that primates have a distinct cortical image of homeostatic afferent activity that reflects all components of the physiological conditions of all tissues of the body.

> It comprises sensing the physiological condition of the body, as well as the representation of the internal state within the context of ongoing activities, and is closely associated with motivated action to homeostatically regulate the internal state ([Craig, 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b11)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zvesr1n3jpc5kxwyp6cp1t))


> However, Whitehead and Drescher suggested that there may be a generalized tendency to be aware of visceral events, at least in specific situations evoking interoceptive feelings. In the following section we will have a closer look on underlying systems supporting interoception. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zvm1cqwnk8j0hv2qn49c2g))


> Neuroanatomic evidence emphasizes the relevance of an “interoceptive neural network” in the brain comprising the somatosensory and somatomotor cortices, the insular cortex, cingulate cortex (ACC), and prefrontal cortices (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). These structures are relevant for monitoring the internal emotional and viscerosensory state ([Critchley, Corfield, Chandler, Mathias, & Dolan, 2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b14); [Critchley et al., 2003](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b15)), for emotion processing and reactivity ([Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon, 2002](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b48)), for the feeling of self-generated and externally induced emotions ([Anders et al., 2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b1)), and the self-regulation of feelings and behavior ([Beauregard, Levesque, & Bourgouin, 2001](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b4); [Bechara, 2004](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b5)).

> Within this interoceptive network the insula represents a relevant projection site of viscerosensory input from different modalities from the body. Interoceptive stimuli that activate the anterior insular cortex (AIC) include thirst, dyspnea, the Valsalva manoeuver, “air hunger,” sensual touch, itch, heartbeat, and distension of the bladder, stomach, or esophagus (see [Craig, 2009b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b13)). Evidence from work on recognition of body movement, music and rhythm, emotional awareness, self-recognition, and time perception underscores the relevance of the insular cortex and/or the ACC ([Craig, 2009b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b13)) for *all* subjective human feelings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zvp3mhn6rp6dqa3jxqyny7))


> A recent model of interoception ([Craig, 2009b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b13)) underscores the role of the insula for the translation of visceral and further bodily states into subjective feelings and self-awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zw7xdhnrq1p2qcdp2qx10n))


> The culmination point of this progression is a complex and rich representation of the “global emotional moment” in the anterior insula that represents the ultimate representation of all one’s feelings, thereby constituting the “sentient self,” in the immediate present (now). In this model, the AIC provides a unique neural substrate that instantiates all subjective feelings from the body and feelings of emotion at a certain moment of time supporting the proposition that subjective awareness is built on homeostasis. In this view, the neural basis for “awareness” is the neural representation of the physiological condition of the body, and the homeostatic neural construct for a feeling from the body is the foundation for the encoding of all feelings ([Craig, 2009b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b13)).

> This is in accordance with the “somatic marker” hypothesis of [Damasio (1994, 1999)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b18 #b19) stating that this meta-representation of bodily states constitutes an emotional feeling, accessible to consciousness and providing the “gut-feeling” that guides our decision processes and forms the basis for our “self” and consciousness. The neuroanatomic basis of interoception represents the link for the “body in the mind” and the mechanisms of the embodiment of affective and cognitive functions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zwjm6vqthy4pzpv29w4qe9))


> following models ([Craig, 2009b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b13); [Damasio, 1994, 1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b18 #b19)) suggest that the foundation for our emotional feelings lies in the neural representation of the physiological condition of the body, with “somatic markers” evoking feeling states that influence cognition and behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zwraecsn8qd7z6x1mfrwth))


> Recent data confirm that the accuracy with which bodily, cardiac signals are perceived is associated with benefits in decision making ([Werner, Jung, Duschek, & Schandry, 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b502)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zwp0tphdf1a5yyna03t7nv))


> These findings indicate that IA is crucially associated with the self-regulation of behavior in different situations of daily living that are accompanied by somatic and/or physiological changes giving rise to “somatic markers.” The relevance of our “gut-feelings” for decision making and behavior especially shows up in situations of uncertainty and complexity where we are free to decide upon our own actions ([Damasio, 1994](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b18)). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zws27er5fvctwawk7r87q4))


> Taken together, convincing empirical evidence and theoretical foundations have been provided for the relevance of interoception for feelings and cognitive functions. However, it should be borne in mind that most of the findings up to now are based on correlational data and imply the objection to ask in how far interoception is indeed causally involved in our emotional and cognitive processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zww0yjrqa3ad1pza8pfrx9))


> They argue that the accumulation function in the posterior insula might be correlated with the encoding of time intervals as suggested by Craig ([2009a,b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b12 #b13)). Craig’s model proposes a close interaction between interoceptive processes and time perception, suggesting that our experience of time emerges from emotional and visceral states processed in the insular cortex. It can be interpreted as a series of global emotional moments that are indexed across a finite period of present time, from the past into the anticipated future. These series produce a cinemascopic “image” of the sentient self that is continuous across a moving window of present time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zx2zt8y6wg4mxbzs7vz8k9))


> In a recent article [Fuchs and Schlimme (2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b24)) presented the concept of embodiment as a novel paradigm for an interdisciplinary approach to psychopathology and neuroscience.

> The authors argued that the phenomenology of the lived body is able to overcome dualistic concepts of the mind as an inner realm of representations that mirror the outside world. They referred to a common phenomenological distinction between the body that one pre-reflectively lives in, that is, the lived or subject body (German: Leib), and the physical body that one can perceive or that is perceived by others, in other words, the object body (German: Körper). Fuchs and Schlimme defined psychopathology of embodiment based on the proposed distinction of subject and object body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zxeh4g9b13m56kfr1s0bkc))

> For both entities there is a clear hypothesis that a disturbance in embodiment is related to affected perception of bodily processes. In this context, recent work on body-ownership and its representation in the brain are of great relevance ([Tsakiris, Jimenez, & Costantini, 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b64); [Tsakiris, Schütz-Bosbach, & Gallagher, 2007)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b65). Namely, Tsakiris and colleagues ([Tsakiris et al., 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b64)) were the first to demonstrate an interaction between interoceptive and exteroceptive awareness of the body. They were further able to show that interoceptive sensitivity predicts the malleability of body representations, suggesting that IA modulates the online integration of multi-sensory body-percepts.

- Note: both entities are alexithymia, and EDs (eating disorders)


> In a recent study we could demonstrate that high scores of alexithymia are associated with low IA ([Herbert et al., 2010a](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b27)) as assessed by a heartbeat perception task. This study adds clear evidence that alexithymia can be described in terms of a disturbance in embodiment. Our results throw a new light on alexithymia and its conceptualization as impairment in the capacity to consciously access emotional responses ([Lane et al., 1998](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b39); [Luminet, Vermeulen, Demaret, Taylor, & Bagby, 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b42); [Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1999](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b62)) by demonstrating deficient perception of bodily signals to represent a habitual characteristic in alexithymia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zxwkcfe06pqkp47pr889fg))


> According to the presented overview, interoceptive states and emotional feelings are directly related and build the fundament of self-awareness and the “self.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zyvm6wpdr2b54h9qj3fk2r))


> The representation of bodily signals and the meta-representation of the state of the body in the brain provide a subjective mental image of the “material self” as a feeling or “sentient” entity (see [Craig, 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b11)), that is, the anatomical basis for emotional awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zyw2v0smvg4jthsnrxwfby))


> The embodied fundament of our self has also been highlighted by [Damasio (1994, 1999)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b18 #b19), who suggested a hierarchy of “selves” that are basically constituted by ongoing bodily reactions fed back to the brain and integrated into “somatic markers.” The lowest level represents the “proto self” that is an interconnected and temporarily coherent moment-by-moment collection of neural patterns of the current state of the organism, while the “core self” is a second-order entity that maps the state of the proto self and is accessible to conscious experience. The mentioned models summarize that levels of “consciousness” or self-awareness are continually regenerated in a series of pulses of bodily signals which obviously blend together to give rise to a continuous “stream of consciousness.” This idea is conceptually connected with earlier views of thinkers belonging to the empiricist tradition like William James. James, who was the first to recognize the importance of bodily reactions for human feelings and thought, described the unbroken flow of thought, and awareness of the waking mind and consciousness as a stream or a continuous succession of experiences ([James, 1890](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b34)). Accordingly, he proposed that consciousness is based upon basic bodily functions and feedback. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6zyye4jgnjty6rg0eschzj6))
