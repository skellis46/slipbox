## Highlights

> These ordinary uses that I have in mind tend to fit a pattern. It is discovered that some task lends itself to automation because it was already formulaic, mechanistic, and predictable: thoughtless writing, box-checking busy work, bureaucratic hoop-jumping, the generation of meaningless content, etc.
>  In short, it is discovered that AI is especially adept at displacing human labor (or, from the enthusiast’s perspective, liberating) in situations wherein humans had already conformed, willfully or otherwise, to the pattern of a machine. Build a techno-social system which demands that humans act like machines and, lo and behold, it turns out that machines can eventually be made to displace humans with relative ease.

>  > Work that was boring to do, but meaningful when completed by humans (like performance reviews) becomes easy to outsource - and the apparent quality actually increases. We start to create documents mostly with AI that get sent to AI-powered inboxes where the recipients respond mostly with AI. Even worse, we still create the reports by hand, but realize that no human is actually reading them. This kind of meaningless task, what organizational theorists have called [mere ceremony](https://substack.com/redirect/8879b230-fbc6-45f3-a139-1a7fb764906a?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) , has always been with us. But AI will make a lot of previously useful tasks meaningless. It it will also remove the facade that previously disguised meaningless tasks. We may not have always known if our work mattered in the bigger picture, but in most organizations, the people in your part of the organizational structure felt that it did. With AI-generated work sent to other AIs to assess, that sense of meaning disappears. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4zpkbrb6amymwbxywndh2v4))


> Put somewhat differently, the message of the medium we are presently calling AI is the realization that modern institutions and technologies have been schooling people toward their own future obsolescence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4zpy4ct5b7fm2qhseav6nkk))


> In the 1960s and 70s, the social critic Ivan Illich ² offered a sustained and blistering critique of industrial age institutions—including schooling, medicine, and transportation, you know, the ones we then to think of as “good”—precisely along these lines. What these institutions have chiefly taught us, Illich argued, is that we are, in ourselves, inadequate to the task of living together as human beings in the world. That we cannot get on without the products and services that they alone can supply. Such institutions are not interested in equipping or empowering us, only in confirming us in an indefinite state of dependence in a consumerist mode. The professions associated with such institutions Illich called “disabling professions.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4zq0c0hbtza7qthnx3pn6j8))


> What I mean by this, and I want to be careful how I put this, is not that the handful of people I had spoken to beforehand, regardless of how they dealt with me, were not persons with full moral standing. I only mean that their speech and actions were machine-like in quality. So then, it seemed to me that there were not two but three possibilities in navigating this system: encountering a machine, encountering a person whose actions conform to the machine, and, finally, encountering a person who somehow managed to resist such conformity. ⁴ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4zq5w9706za89qcxdq2baxa))
