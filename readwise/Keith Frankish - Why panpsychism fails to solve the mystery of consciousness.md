## Highlights

> Panpsychism’s popularity stems from the fact that it promises to solve two deep problems simultaneously. The first is the famous ‘hard problem’ of consciousness. How does the brain produce conscious experience? How can neurons firing give rise to experiences of colour, sound, taste, pain and so on? In principle, scientists could map my brain processes in complete detail but, it seems, they could never detect my experiences themselves – the way colours look, pain feels and so on: the *phenomenal properties* of the brain states involved. Somehow, it seems, brain processes acquire a subjective aspect, which is invisible to science. How can we possibly explain this?

> Physics doesn’t say what an electron, or any other basic particle, is like in itself, *intrinsically*. And, arguably, it never could, since its conceptual resources – mathematical concepts, together with the concepts of causation and spatiotemporal position – are suitable only for describing structures and processes, not intrinsic qualities. Yet it is plausible to think that particles can’t just be collections of dispositions; they must have some intrinsic *categorical* properties that give rise to their dispositions.

> Maybe consciousness – the elusive subjective aspect of our brain states – is the ingredient missing from physics. Perhaps phenomenal properties, or ‘proto-phenomenal’ precursors of them, are the fundamental intrinsic properties of matter we’re looking for, and each subatomic particle is a tiny conscious subject. This solves the hard problem: brain and consciousness emerge together when billions of basic particles are assembled in the right way. The brain arises from the particles’ dispositions to interact and combine, and consciousness arises from what the particles are like in themselves. They are two sides of the same coin – or, rather, since on this view consciousness is the fundamental reality underlying physical reality, brains are manifestations of consciousness. As it holds that there is a single reality underlying both mind and matter, panpsychism is a form of *monism*. The label ‘Russellian monism’ is sometimes used for it and closely related positions, because Bertrand Russell proposed similar ideas in *The Analysis of Matter* (1927).

> A related problem concerns conscious subjects. It’s plausible to think that there can’t be conscious experience without a subject who has the experience. I assume that we and many other animals are conscious subjects, and panpsychists claim that subatomic particles are too. But is that it? Are there any intermediate-level conscious subjects (molecules, crystals, plants?), formed like us from combinations of micro-subjects? It’s hard to see why subjecthood should be restricted to just subatomic particles and higher animals, but equally hard to think of any non-arbitrary way of extending the category.

> Despite these problems, many people feel that panpsychism offers the best hope of cracking the hard problem. The philosophers David [Chalmers](http://consc.net/papers/panpsychism.pdf), Galen [Strawson](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45941139_Realistic_Monism_Why_Physicalism_Entails_Panpsychism) and Philip [Goff](http://www.academia.edu/3827581/Why_panpsychism_doesnt_help_explain_consciousness), among others, have defended versions of it, and there is a lively ongoing discussion of the problems it faces and the best way to respond to them in contemporary philosophical [books](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/consciousness-in-the-physical-world-9780199927357?cc=gb&lang=en&) and [journals](http://philpapers.org/rec/JASP-2). Is it the bold move we need to make progress on consciousness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz94r1e8aefg6nr342cjbqp1))


> Even if we accept that basic physical entities must have some categorical nature (and it might be that we don’t; perhaps at bottom reality is just dispositions), consciousness is an unlikely candidate for this fundamental property. For, so far as our evidence goes, it is a highly localised phenomenon that is specific not only to brains but to particular states of brains (attended intermediate-level sensory representations, according to one influential [account](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-conscious-brain-9780195314595?cc=gb&lang=en&)). It appears to be a specific state of certain highly complex information-processing systems, not a basic feature of the Universe.

> So I’m not a panpsychist. I agree with panpsychists that it *seems* as if our experiences have a private, intrinsic nature that cannot be explained by science. But I draw a different conclusion from this. Rather than thinking that this is a fundamental property of all matter, I think that it is an illusion. As well as senses for representing the external world, we have a sort of inner sense, which represents aspects of our own brain activity. And this inner sense gives us a very special perspective on our brain states, creating the impression that they have intrinsic phenomenal qualities that are quite different from all physical properties. It is a powerful impression, but just an impression. Consciousness, in that sense, is not everywhere but nowhere. Perhaps this seems as strange a view as panpsychism. But thinking about consciousness can lead one to embrace strange views. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz94vpwhk86f57cgp88zc4fc))
