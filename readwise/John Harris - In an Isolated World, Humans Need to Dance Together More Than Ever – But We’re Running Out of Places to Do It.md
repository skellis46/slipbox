## Highlights

> So it is that a whole chunk of our shared culture is falling away. And as takings drop, premises close and people lose their jobs, we are losing something every bit as precious: spaces where people can gather to dance. This is a profoundly human pastime that we have indulged in for as long as our species has been around, but it is now in danger of being pushed to the social margins.

> For the last week, I have been immersed in a [brilliant new book](https://djmag.com/news/new-book-looks-history-why-we-dance) called Dance Your Way Home, by the music and culture writer Emma Warren, which throws all this into sharp relief. Weaving together memoir and social history, it explores dancing through stories that include her memories of 1980s school discos, moral panics in 1930s Ireland, and the grime and dubstep milieus of London in the early 21st century. The writing is often subtly political, but what really burns through is a sense of dancing not just being redemptive and restorative, but an underrated means of communication.

> “Each time we move,” Warren says, “we share information about who we are, where we’ve been and where we’re going, like the body’s version of accent or tone of voice … Each gesture, flex, slide or shape we make in response to music contains communication and history.” Music, she rightly insists, “sounds better when it’s danced, and when it’s communal.” She writes about many people’s anxiety and fear about dancing, but captures its inherent democracy: “The day-to-day art of moving to music is not about quantifiable excellence; it’s about coming as you are and contributing to the dancefloor.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwedhw8pthngt4pnvbn3sthq))


> Just over 30 years ago, that inclusive vision was pushed into the cultural mainstream by the upsurge known as [acid house](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/12/acid-house-as-it-happened-dave-swindells-photographs-summer-of-love-1988), which decoupled dancing and clubs from the cliches that still dominate some people’s understanding of them – drinking, “pulling”, fighting – and was all about shared transcendence and self-discovery. “I was in jeans and T-shirt, recognising how my body liked to move, how it could stretch and contract on its own terms without having to consider how this affected my status as it related to being fanciable, as it had at school,” Warren says. “I was there to dance, and I would dance for hours and hours.” This was circa 1990. By 1994, she points out, there were more than 200 million separate admissions to UK nightclubs, which outstripped those for sport, cinemagoing and the other remaining “live arts”. In that context, what has happened since seems even more tragic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwedken8t28gjs6fs776tn5k))


> Just to be clear: as evidenced by innumerable TikTok videos, the relationship between music and movement remains as indelible as ever, and dancing is hardly in danger of extinction. The problem is that we are losing places to do it in the company of others, and beyond licensing restrictions and costs lies a tangle of much deeper factors, from [abstemiousness among the under-30s](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/21/generation-z-has-different-attitudes-says-a-new-report), to aspects of the way we now live which cut across the kind of letting-go that dancing demands – one example is social media’s culture of body shaming and enforced narcissism. Another is the fact that phones facilitate filming. Speaking as someone whose late adolescence was partly played out on the dancefloor, the idea of dancing on camera – let alone that the footage might then be freely available – would have not only have contravened clubbers’ etiquette, but completely killed the fun.

> The observation of one London youth worker, [reported](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/happiness-among-uk-young-people-has-hit-13-year-low-study-finds) last year in a Guardian news story, speaks volumes: “There are great hugs and shrieks when they get together, but then everyone goes on their phone.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwednqp1bvb2xexxswx7txv5))


> Among the many distillations of magic in Warren’s defiantly celebratory book, one of the best is the idea of dancing as “supportive togetherness”. Here, perhaps, is both a potential cure for the modern malaise, and even more proof of the precious things we lose each time a club closes.
