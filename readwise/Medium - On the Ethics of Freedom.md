## Highlights

> In her seminal The Ethics of Ambiguity French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir declares that being free is not equivalent of being able to do whatever you want whenever you want.
>  Rather, true freedom involves embracing the transcendence of existence. And this movement most certainly doesn’t include the oppression of others; it is its antithesis. The existence of other free individuals is the condition of one’s own freedom.
>  This point can beneficially be drawn into today’s capitalistic consumer reality. If suppressing others — whether this be directly or indirectly — makes you unfree, you are actually acting against your own freedom when buying and consuming goods that you know are probably not produced in an ethical way. Products that you know are most likely produced by workers in an Asian sweatshop who are paid an astoundingly low wage, and who work long hours under horrific conditions in order for you to be able to wear the newest trendy fashion item at a low cost, or in order for you to buy weekly new plastic toys for your kids.
>  Because let’s be honest: when we buy a cotton shirt for less than $10, a pair of shiny new shoes for $15, or a radio-controlled plastic car for $5, we know that in order for this to be possible somewhere in the value-chain someone must have surely paid a high price.
