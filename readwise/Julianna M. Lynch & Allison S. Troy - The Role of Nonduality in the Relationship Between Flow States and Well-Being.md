## Highlights

> The current study investigated the hypothesis that the relationship between flow states and well-being is mediated by nondual experiences. Past empirical and theoretical work suggests flow states share similarities with nondual experiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1xbnrt181fwda23sxkyz6n))

- Note: p.1639.
  - implies that there is a difference between flow states and NDA (even the word 'state' gives it away really).


> flow states may facilitate some features of nonduality and share similarities with meditative states. Additionally, the link between flow and well-being may be explained by its similarities to meditative states ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1xag6c90fw2xf7mvxe8cdh))

> During a state of flow, individuals become absorbed in the activity they perform as it provides a challenge-skill balance which keeps the individual engaged, without falling into boredom or anxiousness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha1xnnz18trzdzjj4ryj924p))


> The nine dimensions of the flow state include challenge-skill balance, clear goals, unambiguous feedback, concentration, transformation of time, action-awareness merging, paradox of control, loss of self-consciousness, and autotelic experience (Csikszentmihalyi, [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR10); Jackson & Marsh, [1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR23)).

> Although it may be inconclusive whether an individual experiences pure nondual awareness, experiences containing nondual features are often illuminating and blissful, and demonstrate the psychological and spiritual benefits of nonduality generally (Blackstone, [2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR6); Hanley et al., [2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR21)).

> One possible explanation for the link between flow states and short-term well-being (positive and negative emotion) is that immersive activities can promote concentration while potentially decreasing self-awareness, which leads to a decrease in the intensity of negative emotions (Gross, [1998](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR19); Leary & Gohar, [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR31)).

> Although typically associated with meditation, there is some consensus that nondual experiences may occur in other relevant contexts, beyond that of meditation (Blackstone, [2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR6); Hanley et al., [2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR21)). Certain dimensions of flow, such as the loss of self-consciousness, the merging of action-awareness, and the autotelic experience, suggest that some aspects of nondual awareness may underlie the psychological components described during flow states.

> According to Josipovic ([2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)), nondual awareness is an underlying awareness in all conscious experiences, even if left unrealized. It could be that flow states tap into or uncover portions of this nondual awareness, revealing nondual features of experience to the individual.

> The integration of self during flow activities parallels ideas found in the larger philosophical perspective of nonduality. Nonduality describes a unification between subject and object, such that boundaries between self and world dissolve. This perspective permeates many different religious, mystical, and philosophical traditions, and can be explicitly found in the Hindu schools of Advaita Vedānta and Kashmiri Shaivism, Mahāyāna Buddhism, and Tibetan Bon Dzogchen and implicitly present in Daoist traditions (Blackstone, [2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR6); Krägeloh, [2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR29); Wright, [2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR44)).

> *The Dexterous Butcher* is a famous proverb by Zhuangzi that describes a cook cutting up an ox (de Bary & Bloom, [1968](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR2)). A beginner would “hack” away at the meat, but the butcher knows the way of non-doing, and can effortlessly glide the knife through the meat while avoiding all the joints and ligaments. Like flow, there is a balance of challenge and skills, a merging of action and awareness, and the focus is no longer on the self. In such an absorbed state, the self is not merely ignored, but rather *transforms* as the person becomes integrated into the activity. The subject (the butcher) and the object (cutting the ox) have merged into a single dynamic unit. This experience, commonly described as becoming One with the object, is a feature of nonduality.

> While nonduality describes a perspective about the relationship between subject-object, fully realizing nonduality, or nondual awareness, is a non-representational and reflexive consciousness in which distinctions between subject and object no longer endure and is spontaneously realized (Josipovic, [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28); Krägeloh, [2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR29)).

> more research is needed to capture a diverse range of activities and skill levels that may investigate nonduality in a context beyond meditation. This would allow for the examination of flow and nondual experiences in an ordinary (i.e., not during a performance) setting.

> While phenomenological aspects of nonduality may be realized and described during particular experiences, nondual awareness describes consciousness that is inherently aware of itself (Dunne et al., [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR13); Josipovic, [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)).

- Note: p.1641


> However, theoretical and neuroscientific investigations attempt to dispel confusion about the experience of nonduality by drawing distinctions between the spontaneous realization of nondual awareness in its pure form, and other experiences of nonduality that still contain mental content and are realized through reflection (Josipovic, [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR26); [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR27); [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)).

- Note: p.1641


> Given that nondual awareness dissolves subject-object boundaries, it could be that this alteration in self-concept encourages a more acceptance-based approach to negative emotions while cultivating positive ones, rather than specifically trying to get rid of negative emotions. The lack of influence on negative emotions also suggests that experiences of nonduality contain distinct features from mere distraction or self-distancing given that these other techniques of emotion regulation have been found to decrease negative emotions specifically (Joormann et al., [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR25); Sheppes & Meiran, [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR40), [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR41)).

  - curious this thought: my hunch would be that feeling of dissolution of self is discombobulating, and might feel similar to sense of being out of control (particularly in people with more negative emotional 'worlds')


> The term nonduality encompasses a unified experience in which the boundaries between self and environment dissolve. This experience of nonduality seems to underlie the experience of flow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ha21g6rf1gy7ertkvg0bcjx9))

> Certain aspects of flow allude to features of nonduality, such as a merging of a person’s awareness with the action being performed, alteration of time, deep concentration, and intrinsic motivation to perform the activity for the sake of itself. Indeed, flow and nondual experience correlate with one another. Yet, nonduality captures a great distinction in how a person perceives themselves and their relations to the world. Rather than merely a loss of self-conscious worry or concern, our findings here suggest that a person’s self becomes integrated with the activity during a state of flow. The integration of subject and object may allow a person’s emotions to be acknowledged, expressed, and processed through the activity. As a perspective of nonduality emerges, an understanding of unity between self and other is encouraged which may aid in the therapeutic process (Blackstone, [2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR6)). The “loss of self-consciousness” dimension of flow was not significantly correlated with the “self-transcendence” dimension of nondual experience, suggesting that experiencing nonduality captures a specific alteration in the self-concept that flow experience alone does not seem to account for.

> As concepts of nondual awareness enter the realm of scientific research, uncertainty arises regarding how a “pure” nondual awareness that is free from mental concepts and phenomenology might be reported or studied. Currently, nondual awareness—when fully realized—seems to have different neural markers and contents of experience than simply having an experience with nondual content, for the exact reason that fully realized nondual awareness is free of content and realizes itself spontaneously (Josipovic, [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR27), [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)). The very use of the Nondual Awareness Dimensional Assessment (Hanley et al., [2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR21)) in capturing experiences with a nondual nature means that the participants in our study were reporting on their felt effects of experiencing nonduality, while most likely not having fully realized nondual awareness in its purest sense.
