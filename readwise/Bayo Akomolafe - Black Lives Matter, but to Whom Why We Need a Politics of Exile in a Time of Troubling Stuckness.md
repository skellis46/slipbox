## Highlights

> Yes, these are moments when telling the truth, verifying identities, fact-checking statements, speaking one’s truth, and acknowledging the objective superiority of science and the scientific method feel like urgent matters of life and death. 
>  The irony of attempting to create safe zones, to nullify the offending body, and to postpone fascism indefinitely is that it is often in the effort to guarantee this immunity to the corrupting influences of the folks across the aisle that we become the very thing we resist. Lean on a wall long enough, push against a surface hard enough, and you also start to take the shape of your adversary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgaw0qp3td3w62em7gscfc4))


> It’s almost as if there is something performatively sticky about trying to flatten an ‘Other’ that reminds us fascism has more readily thrived where people trusted in their own purity, the inertia of their social analyses, and their unflinching certitude about their moral positions. It has thrived where rationality was divorced from feeling and poetry and politics; where extreme lines of distinction were scratched out in the soil to divide “them” from “us”; where the measures adopted to remedy the excesses of the bad guys and to create a safe world cleansed of harm and its effects incarcerated us; and, where other ways of knowing the world were told off as inferior shadows of a more advanced way of knowing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgaxyjntr6vxh171r65z2ae))


> When we begin trusting that we’ve figured it all out, that our descriptions of ‘facts’ are confident reflections of the way the world really is, we become frozen and impervious to the movement of things. The world is not a simple archive of things that happened, but is a creative, orgasmic dancing with itself, experimenting with im/possibilities.

> This essay is about exile, refusal, and wild experimentation as viable political projects we must entertain, especially in moments when the prospects of inclusion and justice, the promise of diversity, and the logistics of equity no longer appear to be in league with our hopes for radical transformation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgnnpa9ncpd86k7njszk3c7))


> to sniff out other frames of Black mattering that wander away from the adversarial, protest-led, voice-driven, critique-inspired, politics of representation we’ve grown so used to and are slowly getting weary of. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgnvqs3a93pfcdqdrgs2rdv))


> Feeling more and more *exterior* to the proceedings, I could now trace out the territorial dominance of a shibboleth, the exalted elephant in the arena. It was like everyone in that space shared the same Netflix password. I am no betting man, but from the looks of things, from how frequently I heard it in passing conversation, and how emphatically the notables stressed it in their presentations, or maybe something I was making up in my head, I was willing to bet my favourite pen *that* password was “Diversity, Equity, Inclusion”.

> The last slave ship didn’t disappear into the backwaters of ignominious times. When it arrived the shore, it *became* the shore. It *turned*. It became the organelles of computational capitalism and its hidden algorithms of bodily reproduction. It became our hegemonic monocultures of mind that orbit around the fetish of the citizen-subject, the dissociated self of modern civilization. It became the managerial logistics of the clearing devoted to the worlding project of singling out the “individual over the field”, by which the “human increasingly [became] the focal point…synonymous with life.” **[3]** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgp9wgdf33kv4jwaff2xqv8))


> Long story short, we were all ‘on’ the slave ship. White bodies. Black bodies. Green bodies. Spotted bodies. Convened by her logic. We were her wooden children, gestating in the flattened worlds it had produced.
>  I couldn’t help but think that the call for Black excellence, for trillions of dollars in new enterprises, was like seeking the finer settling spots in a fishbowl. Like wanting a front row seat on the Titanic. Or seeking an equal piece of a carcinogenic pie. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgpa54vxa4k03babwhtxa06))


> And so, I said it, through dry lips. Feeling like the one person who hadn’t read the script on the greatness of diversity, equity, and inclusion. “There was a lot of representation aboard the slave ship,” I reminded everyone as I named the slow seduction of the centre as the purportedly exclusive source of power and the troubling, contemporary migration from the edges to the city of lights set on the hill. “Black excellence is a form of white capture,” I proposed. “We need a new form of underground, subterranean spirituality. We need a new kind of trickster.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgpcds4gnr7h75cdc6f1mkr))


> Representation comes with a risk of falling out of touch with context in order to fit into a regime of seeing. No matter the gains in visibility, there are always hidden figures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgr9ac0pe1khk7dnwc0wnxt))


> However, just as Odewale’s consanguineous tragedy seemed to be tied to his quest for recognition and migration to the centres of power, the victories of the African nationalist movements activated hidden algorithms buried within the machinery of the nation-state, the prize those movements had fought so hard to win. By *showing up*, by gaining the prestige of becoming nation-states, by striving for excellence, by winning, *we lost*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgrgg3zhv8sajgpqcfc0bwb))


> Firoze Manji writes in his essay on the failure of politics in Africa:
>  **“On coming to power, most of the nationalist governments, often supported by the left, believed that all that was required to satisfy the demands of the masses was to take control of the state. But what they ignored was that the state was itself a colonial state, and set up to serve, protect and advance the interests of imperial power and its entourage of corporations and banks.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgrkzxtc6y6em1k1xvexjt5))


> And yet some lingering questions itch the hard-to-reach middles of our backs: how do Black lives *matter*? That is, not how are they valuable, but what are the conditions for their becoming dense, material, and real? *What is the matter* with Black lives? *What is mattering* with Black lives? By what metrics do we measure Black lives assumedly equal with, say, White lives? Do Black lives matter because we say they do, because we know from the depths of our bones that they do, or because it is self-evident in other undisclosed ways? On what do these claims rest? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grgs0zvkr37a2ac6g74f2w5b))


> In this way, Black Lives Matter is an implicit agreement with, and navigation within, the dynamics of white capture. It is the justified but necessarily limited agitation for the fresh air and roaming space of the upper deck of the slave ship – anything but the lower deck and cramped spaces deep inside the hull of the vessel. The thing about moving through decks is that we – all of us – are still on the damn slave ship. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhanmwmjwj1dedef2rptqjh))


> How do Black Lives Matter? To whom? To power. To the calculations and myth-making stories that centralize the individual above ecologies. To the winding legacies of slave trade and the economies of extraction and displacement they conjured. To the age-reproducing ethos of The Man in his quest for dominance and Icarusian flight. To the global state order launched on the back of World War II and the rapid industry-led consumerism that was birthed on the way to heaven. To the Anthropocene. The power space in which Black lives are said to matter is built on dissociation, on a genocide of relations, **[9]** its dissenting posture notwithstanding. #BLM is ironically the success of white modernity. Its growing visibility and engendered dissent are a trap, a form of entrapment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhapzv6vp9kt9tppx5429s3))


> Nothing is so neat and tidy in an entangled and entangling world. By thinking more in terms of material sciences – how ingredients mix and take on new colours, textures, and shapes; how ethical flows secrete temporary moral structures; how bodies melt into other bodies; how resistance implies intimacy; and, how acting in the world is always an acting-with the world – we might come to touch the corporeal forms of a framework that manufactures Blackness in its colonial hybridity with Whiteness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhc044med9ptnhrmb8nh563))


> It should also be said that Whiteness is not “Caucasian bodies.” I refuse such reductionist moves (mainly because to reduce “whiteness” to “white people” would be to ironically extend the powers of white modernity). Race is not a property of specific bodies per se, but an event co-produced by relations within an assemblage of myriad connections. It is with particular relations – where the properties of ‘things’ only emerge as an effect of their entanglements – that an assemblage becomes racializing. The focus is not on presumably stable entities but on patterns of relations. What ‘Whiteness’ stands out as is a dissociative performance that hijacks the event and makes it subservient to the privileged body, which is itself tautological: in other words, it reduces agonistic tensions, patterns, and embodied movements to pre-figured entities with already stable identities and properties – demanding names, location, and firm histories.

+++++ 
- Note: I want to resist this kind of stability. Fluidity.


> White people are also captives of Whiteness – which seeks to build new pliant surfaces upon the messiness of entanglement, by wiping away the many ways “white people” are grounded, involved, entangled, **[10]** indigenous, moving, spilling, ecstatic, situated, dying, immanent, and becoming-other. Whiteness is the logic of proper welcome: a border issue but also a real estate phenomenon. Through its specific connections to the ‘New World’, to the emergence of the United States as empire, specific senses have frequently been enlisted in who gets to identify as White. But its world-building ritual, working by offering inclusion to scarce privileges, comes with an unanticipated side order of ontological containment. **[11]** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhc282w7athbw9z4fxtb89p))


> By Whiteness then, I mean to temporarily name the racializing assemblage of agencies, cartographies, archetypes, desires, stories, orientations, and gestures that have had the colonial effect of re/producing a hyper-rationalized, flattened world available for human mastery, where the value-laden definition of what it means to be human has historically supported a reiterable group of people, while necessarily excluding others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhc3r8ae81nv9w8t728qgyb))


> To essentialize ‘White bodies’ as evil by association, to reduce even the acts of white slavers to choices that can be weighed on a scale that bends towards good or bad, is to reproduce the liberalist, traditional, ableist image of the free human subject, the wet dream of modernity – untethered to the world around him, unbothered by the actions of a teeming world around him. Untouched by context and environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhcamn66cca2v54nn4dm24h))


> Voices are not solely the products of individual or collective vocal folds: without oxygen, without the efforts of microbial communities that inhabit vocal fold mucosa, without a milieu that grants language such power – often investing it with a nobility denied others who cannot speak, without a politics that gives currency to speaking, without the mutuality of a (perceived) listening apparatus, speaking would be invisible. It would be no matter at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhka2f2kje67tw27fp52fbx))


> Voices exceed the relations of ownership through which we think of ourselves and the world around us. Voices are not the properties of discrete human subjects, but volatile, rarefied, and subtle effects of certain arrangements and bodily configurations. As my dear sister, contemporary dancer, and Black scholar Angelique Willkie puts it, so eloquently, “the sounds we emit do not belong to us; they belong to the room, and not to the emitter.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhketx3b2wk9e8xzwevamny))


> The old reassuring divides by which we name ourselves free individuals and preformed identities with private lives separate from an external world break down under a consideration of the weight of the vibrancy of relations of which human becomings are only a partial convening. The subject/object formula – a particularly anthropocentric equation – gives way to something more processual and relational. As such, even experiences and perceptions, how we think about what happens to us, how we story our lives, and ultimately how we voice these experiences, are nodes of larger effects, powers at large, sociomaterial densities, and animacies, cross-cutting crystallizations of concepts in their efficacious migritude. Our experiences **[14]** are trans-sensorial matters, not properties belonging to preformed persons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhknbn6sg6p4zw8j9z2sejq))


> Black Lives Matter thinks centrally with discrete human individuals, who have voices and identities - a convenient starting place for white modernity as well. This is how it initiates its protest: with a rigid reassertion of the givenness of the individual as a substantial presence with its own pregiven identities and properties. But, to paraphrase Karen Barad, if we began our analysis of social relations from the presumptuous primacy of the human subject, we are already too late. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhkr5kgzas6b2ax9b6cpckh))


> The framing of Black Lives Matter, the slogan, and its operations, gives language too much power, gives voice too much power, and as such gives the modern subject and its paraphernalia too much power. Everything else matters except how matter comes to matter. Black Lives *matter* only within a limited prism of anthropocentric relations intelligible to governance, to the promise of justice, to the apparatus of policing, to the metaphysics of the stable self. As such, what is not allowed to matter is *black mattering –* the wild and potentially agonistic ways bodies mediate and move and modulate and murmur, doing things beyond the bailiwick of intersectionality and identitarian anxieties about who has been left out and who is in the room. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhkw8ys8t6ty9nynysrcawz))


> Black Lives Matter, the secondary logic of containment, is the constitutional exclusion of black mattering, where black mattering hints at the choreography of transindividual flows and tides and magic that exceeds and precedes individuals, meaning, identities, language, voice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhkwr1wtqfp4fzt0xrdh3ns))


> In short, Black Lives Matter is a form of subject formation, one that depends on the managerial halting of *occult* movement or black mattering, which touches on pre-individual dynamics (more on this shortly). Despite its posture seeking to sanitize/rehabilitate Blackness, it is a civilizing ethic that stresses locateability, pronounceability, and visibility within a metaphysics of capture. The offer is a seat at the table; the restaurant is white modernity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhm45ktr9hgjhccmmx8hvjj))


> When Elizabeth Grosz identifies intersectionality as a gridlock system, which fails to account for the mutual constitution and indeterminacies of embodied configurations of gender, sexuality, and race, she means to say that contemporary politics – one which Black Lives Matter occupies – is stuck. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhm6h68hsvy8zqpqjv21vnb))


> If we refused to launch our thinking about these matters – about Kanye’s ramblings, about the righteous demands of BLM, about the pushback of WLM – from the perspective of already determined human subjects with moral positions that correspond with a post-materialist, transcendent reality…if we allowed for an immanent, curd-like, worlding process in which ethical positions are crystallizations of open-ended, non-stable, subject-manufacturing dynamics (instead of essentialist codes perceived through human consciousness), then it is possible to speculate about the ways a moral standpoint *absconds* from fortifying its own position and becomes complicit in the production of the other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhrpejsa1dzc1ezqvezpp23))


> They are the moral positions we adopt, occupy, and act within, only partially touched by articulations of belief. Whether it is the decision to skip breakfast meals or the insistence that the earth is flat, a standpoint is more than just what we believe – more than just the content of what we say we trust in. A standpoint does *other things* beyond reflecting to us our own images; streaming and zigzagging beyond their alleged aboutness and self-referentiality, it is chimeric, mycelial, promiscuities that aerate the soils of our ongoing becoming, creating stabilities and architectural bodies whose equipoising dynamics convene *the others* we then ironically attempt to stifle, to get rid of, to remove, to pathologize, and to cancel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhrr8agkmycknj80yf8gd51))


> The idea is simple enough: moral positions, no matter how austere and well-intentioned, are always performatively entangled with the co-production of the "other". That is, to be "good" is to produce the very conditions that make the "villain" possible. This is not as simple as saying "yin and yang" or reducing this to a binary composition. I mean to suggest that morality **[22]** is never binary and is always caught up in other productions that exceed the immediacy of our convictions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhrt8mrnwt7v6pk56xhq0jj))


> And a moral position, which is already an aesthetic one, which is already an epistemological one, which is already an ontological one, is an effect of larger forces – not an isolated, independent position. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01grhrvkkt8fx8b89027q0t0bh))


> In its fight for the dignity of being seen and in its struggle for the vestigial remnants of the exclusivity of purity, both BLM and WLM, respectively, are the triumphant continuity of the Cartesian series of worlding events dedicated to the primacy of the human individual. They are both in the same moral field. Their moral positions are slushy standpoints that feed each other, cater to, and nurture each other – through hidden algorithms and sociomaterial convergences. It may be difficult to notice but easier when something transversal comes in and crystallizes the seemingly disparate supersaturated solution, hardening it. 
>  Like the Asuras and the Devas, whose eternal other-defining struggle is the condition for the alchemy of the Amrita, BLM and WLM are constitutionally stuck in the co-production of that troubling nectar of contemporary immortality: the paradigm of the citizen, the regime of the seen.
