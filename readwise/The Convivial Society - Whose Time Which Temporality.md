> This moment has lingered with me in the months since. I‚Äôve kept thinking about how my body responded to the gradually diminishing light and how rare such an experience of a measured, unhurried transition had become. Ordinarily, I would pass from the glaring light of the sun during the day to the glaring light of the electric lamp during the evening. Then, when it came time to sleep, the flip of a switch would abruptly take me from light to dark, excepting perhaps the harsh glow of the backlit screen. No gradual transition, no soft, fading light to modulate my stress levels, relax my muscles, and prime me for a night of rest.

> If I think about the character of contemporary life taken whole, the loss of gradual passages strikes me as a more general condition of which the loss of the experience of dusk is but one instance. It is possible, for example, to lament the conquest of the night and what that might entail, but my focus here is not merely on the loss of deep darkness. Rather, my thinking began with the absence of transitions that are rhythmic and gradual rather than sudden and arbitrary. As I‚Äôve thought about this, this may just be a function of a society ordered by precision time-keeping. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwchyx655d4ctmjdbese0rkh))


> Perhaps we can go a bit further. The word *stochastic* is one of the key words of our cultural moment. Perhaps this is a function of the peculiar shape of my own streams of information, but this adjective has appeared with increasing frequency over the last few years to describe a variety of phenomena. Most recently it has appeared in the phrase [‚Äústochastic parrots,‚Äù](https://substack.com/redirect/c3c347a0-5b89-477a-95cc-45d598e958d0?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) a popular way of critically describing large language models. ‚ÄúStochastic terrorism‚Äù is another phrase that has been frequently invoked in recent years. You may be able to supply your own examples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwcj542fa61j1hf26bde9nm4))

> The term has heretofore been most commonly invoked in the technical literature of various disciplines. It describes, simply enough, something that is randomly occurring or, in an older formulation, occurring without rhyme or reason. Maybe the fact that this term has seeped into popular discourse tells us something of consequence. Perhaps it discloses an inchoate apprehension about the character of contemporary society: ours is a stochastic age. Very little is predictable, consistent, regular, or rhythmic. More of our experience seems contingent, beyond our capacity to manage, subject to irregular patterns. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwcj7a1prn3cft2gs867da5w))

> So how then do we understand the temporal heart beating out the rhythm of digital culture? I‚Äôd hazard the following thesis for disputation: digital culture is defined precisely by the fact that it exhibits no discernible temporal rhythm, and many of our social disorders, from the deprivations of private life to the disintegration of public life and the apparent stagnation of culture, stem from this fact.

> **3.** As I continued to think about the passage from day to night, I recalled the work of the Czech philosopher Erazim Koh√°k (1933-2020). I‚Äôve found Koh√°k‚Äôs *[The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry Into the Moral Sense of Nature](https://substack.com/redirect/097f7367-a61a-4988-a7ff-f662815f768b?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc)* to be a wise, moving, and yet wholly unsentimental attempt to understand the consequences of our alienation from nature in the context of Western modernity. ¬π ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwcjkdtf4seept8n1vv2by82))


> Writing in the 1980s, Koh√°k observed that ‚Äúthe world of artifacts and constructs with which we have surrounded ourselves knows neither a law nor a rhythm: in its context, even rising and resting come to seem arbitrary.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwcjnj3tt9cn5v37dy9b8p8n))


> The temporal architecture of consumerist productivity also fails because it is almost always individualist. It carves out a temporal oasis for one within the otherwise inhuman or chaotic temporalities which make their demands of us. They tend not to create a communal time within which friendships may form and flourish. Neither do they generate public time within which political action may unfold. ‚Åµ Indeed, I'd put it more starkly. It is not simply that they do not provide for communal time or public time, they actively inhibit the emergence of such times.

> Koh√°k writes of his philosophical mentors, especially Husserl and Riceour: ‚ÄúTheir stance was one of wonder, not of sophistication; the task they undertook was one of articulation‚Äîand their virtue was na√Øvet√©, a willingness to see before theorizing, to encounter the wonder of being rather than enclose themselves in cunningly devised theories.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwcks4gkf39ta1gyvwbht910))
