> It is from this correspondence, and not from the analysis of ‘data’ within frameworks of ‘theory’, that archaeological knowledge grows. In the practice of excavation, as Matt Edgeworth has recently put it, archaeologists are obliged to follow the cut – to ‘see where it goes, and in what direction it takes us’ – not passively but actively like hunters tracking their prey, ever alert and responsive to visual and tactile clues in an intrinsically variable environment (Edgeworth 2012: 78, see Ingold 2011a: 251 fn. 4). In effect, the cut is a line of correspondence. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=446))

> Instead of a territorial surface segmented into domains or fields of study, we have something more like a rope, wound from corresponding strands or lines of interest. In binding these lines together our aim has been to undo the territorialisation of knowledge implied in the way disciplines are normatively understood, and to celebrate the openness of knowing from the inside.

> The course was delivered through a combination of lectures, practicals, project work and workshops, spread over a period of ten weeks. Following a general introduction, lecture topics included (in this order): design and making; materials; objects and things; gesture and performance; craft and skill; the senses in perception; lines; drawing; notation. Normally, courses offered at this advanced level comprise one lecture and one tutorial per week, each of an hour’s duration. While the lectures for the 4 As followed a fairly traditional format, the tutorials were replaced by weekly practical sessions. In each session students would discuss the issues arising from that week’s lecture, ([Location 475](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=475))

> Besides attending lectures and participating in practicals, students were also required to carry out a project. Project work proceeded throughout the course. Each student was asked to select a ‘thing’6 ([Location 483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=483))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 


> such as a building, a bridge, a bench, an ancient monument, a piece of public sculpture, or a landmark (for example a tower, fountain or prominent tree). The student was advised to spend about an hour with the chosen thing every week, focusing on a specific aspect, and to make notes on what had been observed or discovered. For example, they were asked to attend to the thing’s history, whether it is finished or still growing or under construction, the materials it is made of and their histories, what plants are growing on it or animals living in it, how people and animals move in, over, through or around it, and what it sounds and feels like at different times of day, after dark or in varying weathers. They had to draw or sketch it and make plans of it, and reflect on how their drawing affected their observations.

> In this the contribution of our teachers is not literally to pass on their knowledge, in the form of a ready-made system of concepts and categories with which to give form to the supposedly inchoate material of sensory experience, but rather to establish the contexts or situations in which we can discover for ourselves much of what they already know, and also perhaps much that they do not. In a word, we grow into knowledge rather than having it handed down to us. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=499))

> Accordingly, the role of the student is not to take on board a corpus of authorised, propositional knowledge issuing from a superior source in the academy, but to collaborate in the shared pursuit of human understanding. Yet as Lave herself has pointed out, our institutions of education, at least in the western world, are largely premised on the theory that the classroom is a dedicated space for learning in which students are supposed to acquire the approved knowledge of society, which they can then take into the world outside and put into practice once their education is complete.

Where are you housed? While normally, Bourdieu stays in the study and Stewart in the kitchen, you are at home in both rooms and in any number of other places besides. So perhaps the book’s place is with you, on your person, wherever you happen to be. Do not try to read it, as it will not inform you of what you need to know. You’ll have to find that out for yourself. But do read with it. I hope, then, that it will guide you on your way.

> We are accustomed to think of making as a project. This is to start with an idea in mind, of what we want to achieve, and with a supply of the raw material needed to achieve it. And it is to finish at the moment when the material has taken on the intended form. At this point, we say, we have produced an artefact. A nodule of stone has become an axe, a lump of clay a pot, molten metal a sword. Axe, pot and sword are instances of what scholars call material culture, a phrase that perfectly captures this theory of making as the unification of stuff supplied by nature with the conceptual representations of a received cultural tradition. ‘Material culture’, as Julian Thomas (2007: 15) puts it, ‘represents at once ideas that have been made material, and natural substance that has been rendered cultural.’ In the literature, the theory is known as hylomorphism, from the Greek hyle (matter) and morphe (form). Whenever we read that in the making of artefacts, practitioners impose forms internal to the mind upon a material world ‘out there’, hylomorphism is at work.

> I want to think of making, instead, as a process of growth. This is to place the maker from the outset as a participant in amongst a world of active materials. These materials are what he has to work with, and in the process of making he ‘joins forces’ with them, bringing them together or splitting them apart, synthesising and distilling, in anticipation of what might emerge. The maker’s ambitions, in this understanding, are altogether more humble than those implied by the hylomorphic model.

> To read making longitudinally, as a confluence of forces and materials, rather than laterally, as a transposition from image to object, is to regard it as such a form-generating – or morphogenetic – process. This is to soften any distinction we might draw between organism and artefact. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=646))

> In reality, they insist, whenever we encounter matter ‘it is matter in movement, in flux, in variation’, with the consequence that ‘this matter-flow can only be followed’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 450–451). Artisans or practitioners who follow the flow are, in effect, itinerants, wayfarers, whose task is to enter the grain of the world’s becoming and bend it to an evolving purpose. Theirs is an ‘intuition in action’ (ibid.: 452). ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=720))

> For them, metallurgy highlights a particular insufficiency of the hylomorphic model, namely that it can only conceive of technical operations as sequences of discrete steps, with a clear threshold marking the termination of each step and the commencement of the next. But in metallurgy, these thresholds are precisely where the key operations take place. Thus, even as he beats out the form with hammer on anvil, the smith has periodically to return his iron to the fire: material variation spills over into the formative process and indeed continues beyond it, since it is only after forging that the iron is finally quenched. ‘Matter and form have never seemed more rigid than in metallurgy’, write Deleuze and Guattari, ‘yet the succession of forms tends to be replaced by the form of a continous development, and the variability of matters tends to be replaced by the matter of a continous variation’ (ibid.: 453).

> These moments are known to posterity only because they leave a material trace, and the artefact presents itself, according to Bailey, as an accumulation of such traces – for which he reserves the term ‘palimpsest’.

> For the alchemist, by contrast, a material is known not by what it is but by what it does, specifically when mixed with other materials, treated in particular ways, or placed in particular situations (Conneller 2011: 19). Among innumerable other things, water gurgles down a spout, turns to steam when heated and to ice when cooled, and dissolves salt. And salt, inter alia, can be ground into fine white grains that pass through the hole of a dispenser, prevents the freezing of water on roads and pavements, and gives a distinctive flavour to food.

> As the Swiss architect Peter Zumthor writes, ‘material is endless’: Take a stone: you can saw it, grind it, drill into it, or polish it – it will be a different thing each time. Then take tiny amounts of the same stone, or huge amounts, and it will turn into something else again. Then hold it up to the light – different again. There are a thousand different possibilities in one material alone. (Zumthor 2006: 25) ([Location 837](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=837))

Thus the designing of the watch continues into its making – in the ways the pieces assembled there answer to one another in the generation of internal coherence.

They are no more parts of a watch than are twigs on the forest floor parts of a bird’s nest. Rather, as with the nest, pieces become parts only as the assembly proceeds and tends increasingly to cohere.

It is the task of design to go after them and bring them back. Travelling light, unencumbered by the dead weight of heavy materials, the line of the designer seeks to give chase to the phantasms of a fugitive imagination and to rein them in before they can get away, setting them down as signposts in the field of practice that makers and builders can track at their own, more laboured and ponderous pace.

> And it was above all the sense of the thing as a gathering that he drew from the word’s earlier usages (ibid.: 177). To witness a thing is not to be locked out but to be invited in to the gathering. The round mound, as we have seen, is a thing, a gathering place, in a landscape of things. So too are cottage and cairn. And so, writes Heidegger, are tree, pond, brook and hill. As the mound persists in its mounding, so do cottage, cairn, tree, pond, brook, hill, each carrying on, or ‘thinging’, in its own particular way and, in so doing, issuing forth from a world that is itself ‘worlding’. To join the gathering, as Heidegger puts it in his inimitable style, is to correspond with the thing ‘in its thinging from out of the worlding world’ (ibid.: 181–182). To convert any of these things into a monument, however, or into a feature of its landscape setting, is to bring the correspondence abruptly to a halt.

> Nowhere is the dead hand of objectification more clearly at work than in the essay that launched much of the current debate, Alfred Gell’s Art and Agency (1998). Here, the question is explicitly posed as one about the ascription of agency to what Gell does not hesitate to call ‘art objects’. The presumption is that in the making of such objects, intentions initially framed within the mind of the artist are projected onto the material: thus the intention is the cause, the artwork the effect. And the viewer, subsequently observing the work, is supposed to look through the work to the agency within and behind it (Knappett 2005: 128). But as we saw from Simondon’s example of making bricks, introduced in Chapter 2 (pp. 24–25), this scenario focuses on an arbitrary starting point (the image in the artist’s mind) and an equally arbitrary end point (the allegedly finished work), while missing out all that goes on in between.

> Articulation – or what nowadays goes under the name of ‘joined up thinking’ – may be the friend of reason, but it is the enemy of sentience. It arrests feeling. Thus what Polanyi correctly identified as the mismatch between articulate and personal knowledge is, more fundamentally, between the lateral integration of interconnected propositions and the longitudinal correspondence of entwined movements. Whereas articulate knowledge takes the form of statements about the known, personal knowledge both grows from and unfolds in the field of sentience comprised by the correspondence of practitioners’ awareness and the materials with which they work.

> They enable us to tell in one of its senses, of the way things are going. But they are of not much help when it comes to telling in the other. Noses and ears cannot tell stories, and nor can eyes, unless with Jacques Derrida (1993: 126–128), we hold that the proper function of the eyes is not to see but to weep.

> A great many operations, he observes, entail the regular repetition of certain manual gestures: these include hammering, sawing and scraping.

> The rhythmic repetitions of gesture entailed in handling tools and materials are not, however, of a mechanical kind, like the oscillations of the pendulum or metronome.

Comparison with music would lead to a focus on the expressive gesture and its duration, but would also bring up the question of what difference it makes when the gesture leaves no enduring trace at all. Each comparison would prompt a somewhat different characterisation of drawing.

> Just like the draughtsman’s line (ibid.: 111), the cut moves in directions that are sometimes foreseen but ‘at other times wildly at variance with expectations’ (Edgeworth 2012: 78). And the same, too, goes for building. Taking Simon Unwin’s (2007: 108) point that ‘all buildings are drawings; not the built realization of drawing but drawings in and of themselves’ – their walls and pathways drawn out in the very process of building and moving – then in the hands of the builder, the trowel serves as a transducer just as it does for the archaeologist. Only in the eyes of the architect is the trowel a bridge between the initial design and the final construction. For the builder it allows him to navigate the treacherous waters that flow beneath.

> ‘Instead of dictating a thought’, writes Pallasmaa (2009: 111), ‘the thinking process turns into an act of waiting, listening, collaboration and dialogue [in which] one gradually learns the skill of co-operating with one’s own work.’ Co-operating with one’s work – now there’s a good definition of correspondence! This thinking, this imagining, goes on as much in the hands and fingers as in the head. It is strung out in the lines of practice.

> ‘The creator’, according to Serge Tisseron (1994: 37), ‘is the one who agrees to venture forth with no certainty and follow this thread unwinding ahead of him like Ariadne’s thread, and falling behind him like a spider’s web.’ Are not thoughts veritable spiders’ webs? Are they not, as John Berger puts it (2005: 133), ‘like strings all tangled together?’ Not only that, says Berger, but in this drawing-thinking you become what you draw: not in shape but in affect (ibid.: 126). You know it from the inside, and in your gesture you relive its movement. Drawing is transformative (Cain 2010: 76).

Thus he went on to advise the novice: ‘try always, whenever you look at a form, to see the lines in it which have had power over its past fate and will have power over its futurity. Those are its awful lines; see that you seize on those, whatever else you miss’ (Ruskin 1904: 91). ([Location 3086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EVWKFFS&location=3086))
