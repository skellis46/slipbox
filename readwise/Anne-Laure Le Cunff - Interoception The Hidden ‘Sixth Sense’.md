## Highlights

> We also have an internal sensory system that allows us to perceive and interpret signals originating from within the body — such as your heart, stomach, or lungs. For instance, you may feel hungry, sense your heartbeat increasing, or notice the air in your lungs. For instance, you may feel hungry, sense your heartbeat increasing, or notice the air in your lungs. This process through which your nervous system maps your body’s internal landscape is [called](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451902217302343) interoception.

> our brains didn’t evolve to merely react to the world around us, but rather to try to predict what will happen to us next based on both external and internal signals. This predictive process is how your brain makes sense of the world and guides your actions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h9swwwcvsfpqn0m50e3xv2qn))


> **1. Interoception can be conscious or subconscious.** Interoception includes the processing of signals such as the rate of your heartbeat, your breathing, and whether you’re full or hungry, among many others. We perceive many of these sensations unconsciously, but some make their way into our conscious awareness. This conscious processing of our internal signals is known as interoceptive awareness. And this seems to be a useful skill, as the ability to regulate our emotions has been [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032718323723) to be associated with interoceptive awareness.

> **3. Interoception deeply influences both mental and physical health.** Research [suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6054486/) that a higher degree of interoceptive awareness has been linked to enhanced mental health, while lower interoceptive awareness is associated with several mental disorders. For instance, people suffering from depression may have a [reduced ability](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.13915) to perceive bodily signals, which may contribute to emotional numbness. People with anxiety may be hypersensitive to cues from their own bodies, [leading](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886921005122) to exaggerated responses. This disconnection between what the body feels and how those signals are acted upon has also been [found](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022399917311443) to be central to eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia.
