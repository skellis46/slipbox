## Highlights

> However, there is another explanation that I think is special to meditation: unlike the body, the mind is invisible. It is easy to see when you gain weight — the number on the scales goes up, your clothes don't fit as well, etc. What is the mental equivalent of seeing that you have gained weight? Or to frame it more positively: what is the mental equivalent of seeing that you have become stronger, fitter, more flexible, etc.? It is not impossible to notice these changes, but they are less obvious than the corresponding bodily changes that result from exercise. Because of this, the positive feedback we get from meditation is less obvious, and so there can be less motivation to do it.

> In *The Principles of Psychology*, William James stated this observation particularly forcefully:
>  "There is no such thing as voluntary attention sustained for more than a few seconds at a time. [...] No one can possibly attend continuously to an object that does not change." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy7wthsyam47cm9x0sx7k3z))


> This example is due to [Tse 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2004.11.001) and it demonstrates one way in which our attention affects our perception. Roughly speaking, focusing attention on an object increases its apparent contrast (the full story is more complicated than this, but that is the basic idea).

> One explanation for why your attention wanders in this way is that this is your brain's way of searching the environment for new and valuable information. One may even argue that this search procedure is optimal in some sense — perhaps for the typical environment our ancestors found themselves in. Having one's attention wander somewhat randomly, scanning the environment, can be a good way to spot novel sources of food, hidden dangers, etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy80m818227cn0xv5ecwn1m))


> In fact, there is more to this problem than simply keep our attention focused on something. Our success is also heavily dependent on our ability to *change* the focus of our attention. Just as our attention naturally wanders seemingly on its own accord, it also has a tendency to *fixate*. For example, it has been shown that anger and conflict have a strong tendency to focus our attention, and it is difficult to "switch gears" and focus on something else immediately afterwards. In other words, our attention also has an inertia to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy85erphyb3esy80meg62qx))


> So we have seen three ways in which we can lack control over our attention: focusing it, shifting it, and diffusing it. The better we are at controlling our attention in these ways, the better we do in general. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy8643n1pnktnsdpkrsjxx4))


> These two forms of meditation have come to be known as: *focused-attention meditation*, and *open-monitoring meditation*. Roughly speaking, these two meditative practices help us learn to do two different things to our attention: to focus it, and to diffuse it. As we will see in a moment, they also help us learn how to control our attention in others ways as well. However, for the sake of getting started, it helps to think of these practices in this coarse-grained way: focused-attention meditation helps us focus our attention, and open-monitoring meditation helps us diffuse it.

> Another secondary benefit is that you get better at noticing when your attention has wandered. This is a metacognitive ability that has a range of benefits, from emotional regulation, to executive control over behavior, to better decision making. Each time your attention wanders away from your breath and you become absorbed in some train of thought, you enter a daydream. It's been estimated that we spend almost half of our time daydreaming and that this tends to make us unhappy ([Killingsworth and Gilbert 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1192439)).

> With respect to mind wandering, we also see the benefits we would expect. Several studies have shown that meditation reduces activity in the default mode network (DMN), which tends to become more active during phases of mind wandering ([Tomasino et al. 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00346), [Brewer et al. 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1112029108), and [Garrison et al. 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13415-015-0358-3)). In particular, [Scheibner et al. 2017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.044) found that during sessions of focused-attention meditation, the DMN was activated when participants were mind wandering and deactivated when their attention was focused on their breath.

> The scientific research on meditation is rapidly growing, but it is still a relatively new field, so we should be careful in how confidently we draw conclusions from it. [Van Dam et al. 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691617709589) and [Davidson and Dahl 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691617718358) give good overviews of the challenges and limitations involved in this research, especially as it relates to the mental quality of *mindfulness* (which is a topic that requires another article).
