## Highlights

> some metaphors are more real than the people you see walking down the street. -- Fernando Pessoa (Page 1)


> But before Euripides, and before Fernando Pessoa and Homer, and even before the Bible, before, before, before there was dance. For thousands of years people danced, everyone danced and there were so many reasons to dance; people danced to celebrate growth and change, weddings, rituals and funerals, initiations and births. There were dances for community-building, mostly danced in ring structures, in part for safety there were dances for a good harvest, which are for sustenance there were dances for prayer and war, peace and ecstasy. People danced for every aspect of life from the emotional to the physical to the spiritual. Dance was once fundamental and essential, and everyone danced. (Page 7)


> And thousands of years later people began to dance to entertain one another, so there came to be a division between the watchers and the dancers; people danced in front of other people who were seated, and this trading of physical energy between the dancers and the seated people, this shared experience of giving and receiving kinetic energy became a community feedback loop, a call and response form, that was both a physical experience and a variation on a symmetrical structure. (Page 8)


> Going back to this "pause" moment between me and the blonde man in the track suit walking beside me on the street with the dog on the leash stretched across the sidewalk, I loop back to it because in this fragment I use five prepositions to describe what is happening in this simple pedestrian incident.
>  Prepositions are little generative machines for making dance material because they direct you to where action is happening. For instance, physically imagine the preposition beside. Beside implies a proximity, that you are adjacent to something or someone, and it also implies a sense of pairing, or a duet. (Page 11)


> Actually art comes from perception and craft plus a muscular imagination, all things unrelated to being a good person, and in dance it's especially unusual to be loved or good. My theory is that when you are making dance, the choreographer demands a tremendous amount from the dancers bodies, and the dancers can become primarily vessels to animate the choreographer's artwork, which sounds cold, and it is at least partially cold, so over time dancers are often unhappy, especially when they pass the seven-year mark. (Page 14)


> The Great Tragedians were the first-known ironists, and they enacted irony by allowing the audience to know more about the characters than the characters know about themselves, which seems very true, like in real life your friends can clearly see your flaws, your foolishness, they even see what you will suffer, but they can't help you, because even if they had the nerve to disclose their insights, to know something about yourself and then to change, this involves a readiness. (Page 16)


> And really, I say to Paul, our lives don't operate in a neat cause-and-effect narrative structure, the way we neatly pretzel our lives into these neat linear stories and then neatly defend ourselves against anything that defies our highly constructed neat narrative, and a telltale sign of this construct is that the story neatly holds a single meaning. (Page 27)


> Now Paul tells Jack that he feels like he is turning against Homer, he says he is wondering about all this clarity of action, that it feels like it's denying him his own thoughts, and he can't help but compare it to the Old Testament, which is oblique and bizarre but paradoxically and inexplicably relatable- you can feel its meaning in your body, even though that meaning is not abundantly clear. I know what you mean, I say from the kitchen, every year in synagogue when I read the Old Testament, the stories sound vastly different than the last year. Even though the text is unchanged, you are different, and the world is different, and the text gracefully allows for these shifts, which brings up for me the triangle. (Page 30)


> I always imagine the experience of reading as this: the book is one point on a triangle, the second point on his triangle is you the reader, and the third point is the current state of the world. And these three points are in a dynamic balance. Meaning, whatever you are reading, you experience it through the lens of your own life, plus the world you are living in; and if that world is on fire, the writing may be rendered tone deaf, benign or especially urgent.
>  Triangle: the Reader, The Book, the world
>  I think it was Brecht who said: If you do the right thing at the wrong time, you're wrong, which brings up the matter of timing in creating work as well, because even though we desire artists to be godlike and prophetic, they are just people doing their business, and their combination of insight and lack of insight will align and un-align as the world shifts. (Page 31)


> Orkos, the domestic space of the home, serves as the beginning and endpoint of the outermost narrative circle, but who gets to leave all these tightly wound circles and journey into the "wilderness" (aka self-discovery) and who must remain inside the domestic space needs a shake-up. Penelope, sheltering in place for many years while waiting for her husband's return has earned the right to be the complicated one, to encounter her demons and desires on the road, it's her turn to travel in the shape of a line. I bring this up with Paul on a walk. It's still warm out, so we continue to move our feet to think. (Page 42)


> Paul says that the notion of Penelope stopping her weaving, leaving her home, and going out on a solo journey is too radical an idea to imagine. But I say her weaving is only a protection strategy, she no longer needs to weave, let her go out. No, Paul says, I can't imagine it. Why?, I say. Because, he says, it's the way she functions in the story; there are many heroines I can imagine breaking out, he says, but she isn't one of them. Well, if you can't imagine it, I say, let Louise Bourgeois and Trisha Brown and Hilma af Klint imagine it for you. Look to them. (Page 43)


> Tam listening to them from the kitchen, and I start to realize that all this conversation about Penelope is affecting my choreography. I am in the middle of making a solo in my kitchen, in situ, and though the movement materials of the dance are abstractions of mundane actions we routinely do in the kitchen, like turning on the water in the sink, or setting down a cup, the dance turns out to be surprisingly sad.
>  My friend Scott emails me after watching my dance online:
>  I really liked this! It's so oikos. (Page 47)


> Long before Trisha Brown, before ballet, before disco dances and round dances and square dances, there was ecstatic dancing, and here ecstatic dancing was spontaneously happening in the twenty-first century. We are still fundamentally the same, I thought. We are essentially a body in space with other bodies, expressing how we feel through our dances. (Page 56)


> The young comedian/author's contention was that if you added the phrase of my mind to the end of any sentence, the sentence would take on mythic, indeed hallucinogenic proportions, so from a choreographic perspective, simply by ending with of my mind, the sentence holds this paradox of a large-scale event in the small-scale theater of your head, and because he was a comedian, I think he was also being ironic.
>  Trying to define the word irony is as slippery as a live fish in your hand. I think it was Milan Kundera, an author I fervently read in the 1980s but whose novels may be in an asymmetrical triangle situation with his readership at this moment, I think it was Kundera who wrote that the definition of irony is one eye crying and the other eye watching that tear fall, a perfect image of the mind's odd ability to be self-aware, even in times of deepest sorrow. (Page 64)


> Maybe Homer started it, but it's an old narrative device that if you need to get rid of someone you just kill them off, like you kill off the mother so you can have a father/ son movie or whatever, so Homer kills off the dog to save Odysseus, and Paul says since no one noticed him but the dog maybe it stems from class bias to ignore the beggar, and dogs of course don't know anything about class bias, but they do seem highly aware of sticks and leashes, so it's sad when someone trains their dog to get their own leash. (Page 68)


> One day in Durham, NC, my choreography teacher said to me while standing in a dark theater at a technical rehearsal:
>  "We make more of death than death makes of us."
>  From a choreographic perspective, that's a back/front mirroring, (p.71) plus this teacher was very old, so she was, from a time / space perspective, proximate to death.(p.72) (Page 71)


> Dissolving in tears, bursting in tears, indulging in tears, brushing tears away, tears streamed down his cheek, a flood of tears, tears flooding his eyes, spells of grief, storms of tears, tears overwhelm, blinding tears, blinding tears, my tears, her tears, his tears, shedding tears, wiping his tears, melted into tears, tears of heartbreak, throbbing sorrow, streaming tears, wailing and streaming live tears, waiting in tears, begging with tears, tears welled up in his eyes, painful longing for tears, weeping live warm tears, hot tears, streaming tears, river of tears, face wet with tears, broke into tears, tears of grief, wiping their tears, groaning in grief and tears, her bitter tears, cheeks streaked with tears, drown in tears. cheeks rivering tears, broke into tears, weeping live warm tears, knelt down and wept, how long must you weep, how bitterly they wept, he wept, he wept tears for the one he lost. (Page 75)

- Note: Version like this but if memory from Proust or Krapp's last tape?? perfect memory


> Wasn't there a dance of death in medieval times? Wasn't it an ecstatic dance? Or was it the nervous system reacting to a virus and it was called a dance? I'm not sure, but I don't want to look it up, I am tired of opening my computer to know things. The day is already too virtual to look up something as embodied and important and beautiful as a dance. (Page 84)


> In a sense, social media forms are performative solo forms with an odd conflation of friendship and marketing; the body is alone in a room performing the self, with an undercurrent of desire for applause. Without a town square to gather in and hash out the day with neighbors, social media communications have a shading of loneliness underneath. (Page 91)


> And this desire to articulate what you feel and perceive, to tell it, to name it, to describe it, this is as natural as the progression from walking to running to leaping, to shaping that leap into a pattern of leaps, and then a group of leapers in unison into a dance. (Page 94)
