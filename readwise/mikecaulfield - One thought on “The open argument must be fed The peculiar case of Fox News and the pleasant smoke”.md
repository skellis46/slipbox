## Highlights

> Humans are animals that make arguments. It’s pretty deep in our nature. As I’ve discussed in previous posts, people often think that arguments are about “proving” something is true [but that isn’t quite right](https://mikecaulfield.substack.com/p/reasonableness-2-what-are-we-defending?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2). The best way to think of an argument (and here I pull from my own mishmash of a number of modern philosophers) is that argument is an attempt by a speaker to enhance or undermine *the reasonableness of a position* (my notes attribute this use of “reasonableness” to Matthew McKeon in 2013, but it’s a bit of a scrawl, and I was reading a lot of Robert Pinto back then too).

> This is a bit of a review of the [first post in this series](https://mikecaulfield.substack.com/p/lets-talk-about-open-claims-endless), but it will be quick. Say I am trying to convince you that a friend of yours that just asked you for a loan is not the most trustworthy person. I could just say that. And maybe I do, maybe I blurt that out. “Is Jake really the person you want to trust with ten grand?”
>  What have I done here? The first thing to realize is that I am reacting to what I believe is (or may be) a difference between your position and mine. From my perspective, your attitude to the proposition “Steve is a person one could trust with ten grand” is something like “probably”. And my opinion is not necessarily “no” but it tends towards “probably not”. The idea of argument, from my perspective, is to get you to see that my position on this question is *reasonable*. Depending on how intense I am about this question, I may also wish to show you that your position is *unreasonable*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5zf31830zfb1305zz97670g))


> While some of the detailed reasoning is a bit more in-depth than you may be used to, it’s probably pretty familiar. As mentioned, there is nothing more human than making a claim and then attempting to convince people of its reasonableness.

> I’m not sure if this is different than previous times, but the fact is in the political sphere we have dozens of open arguments, and as events happen we figure out whether — like Steve’s housing appreciation — they can be turned into new evidence.

> Argument ensued. Was it really a sign of corporate timidity in the face of recent attacks on companies like Budweiser and Target that had seen backlash to LGBTQ+ marketing? Or was it just that Diablo was out? Or was it somewhere in the middle?
>  On the side that it was not evidence of decreased support people pointed out the importance of the Diablo launch. Others countered that in previous years the logo had been displayed all month long. **None of this is covered under “misinformation”**, but is a part of a **more fundamental question** — to what extent does this new event or evidence enhance the reasonableness of a position towards an open claim — here, the claim that corporations in general (and MS in particular) have turned out to be fair weather friends in the face public backlash?
>  Everything is like this now. The behavior is as old as time, but the intensity and breadth in our media environments — the way in which so many of us are engaged in endless “evidence-fitting” feels unique to this age. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5zf71b5qy919qcfz546z8b2))


> Rather than stating a thesis and outlining the three points and sixteen pieces of evidence one will present, most social and political issues are *open issues*. As events happen or new information comes to light, people look at this novel data and ask themselves if it relates to any of the open questions on their mind: Did the MeToo movement have lasting effect? Was the 2020 election stolen? Is climate change a pressing threat? Are we looking at a swift and sudden implosion of social progress on LGBTQ issues?

> It can get a bit bizarre — think about when you first hear about a shooting. Liberals rush to find evidence the shooter was right-wing, an extremist, or a bigot — to enter the shooting in evidence that the rising tide hate in this country has very real effects. I think that is true, personally, but there is still something a bit sick about everyone climbing over one another after a shooting to find the social media profile detail that lets one enter it as evidence. Were they wearing a Trump hat? Did they donate to candidates? What podcasts did they listen to?
>  But of course, on the other side, the right is trying to plug the shooting as evidence into their own arguments. Did it happen in a liberal state or city? Did the person use pronouns in a bio? Did a “good person with a gun” stop the shooting?
>  Sometimes the shooting evidence. Sometimes it really is an extremist. Sometimes what happens upends the liberal theory of why these things happen.
>  But these “evidence scrambles” have become a way of life online. An event happens — a submarine malfunctions — and at the edges someone finds a way to enter that in as “evidence” in the open argument that “woke culture is killing us.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5zfgdeaa65b0d7cn6nr5vsk))


> Which brings us back to the smoke. The smoke is an event. There are information needs *about* the smoke — like don’t go outside if you don’t have to, don’t run your bathroom fan to get rid of it since it pulls in outside air, and so on. In a world without endless open arguments we’d probably just convey these.
>  But the smoke is not just an event — it’s *evidence*. And it’s not just Fox, of course. CNN and other stations are telling people helpful things about avoiding exposure, but are also tying the recent wildfires to climate change (a position that has some validity, even if it is sometimes overstated). They are making the position that it’s likely climate change will make the world unlivable more reasonable. So there’s a claim about the smoke, regarding health and how to handle it. But there’s also a claim about something else, where the smoke is *evidence.* This mix is probably OK. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h5zfj0q9rrgjy0kt10kdsn81))


> But this is where we are — for a variety of reasons everything is evidence now, and the usefulness of it as evidence (or its position as inconvenient evidence) can easily eclipse more mundane concerns like breathing — or not going out into a city blanketed in smoke.
