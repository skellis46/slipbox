## Highlights

> Here’s the first line, “tyranny of tiny tasks,” in context from a paragraph by Tim Wu commenting on “time-saving” technologies:
>  > “The problem is that, as every individual task becomes easier, we demand much more of both ourselves and others. Instead of fewer difficult tasks (writing several long letters) we are left with a larger volume of small tasks (writing hundreds of e-mails). We have become plagued by **a tyranny of tiny tasks** , individually simple but collectively oppressive.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h08xrsgz1nex0hgx03asnfe0))


> It provided for the entire family a regular and bodily engagement with the rhythm of the seasons that was woven together of the threat of cold and the solace of warmth, the smell of wood smoke, the exertion of sawing and of carrying, the teaching of skills, and **the fidelity to daily tasks** .” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h08xraer4pv1j291mbpx2prq))


> I should say at some point, and now seems like a good enough time to say it, that I’m not suggesting that time and labor should never be “saved.” The problem is that “saving” time and labor have become default settings and social imperatives. Rather than wisely judging what labor or time can and ought to be “saved,” our tendency is to buy into the promise indiscriminately.

> So apart from the very real question of whether any time is ever indeed saved or if, as Wu observed, it is just the case that more is always demanded of us, there is also another question that we are tacitly discouraged from entertaining: What precisely are we saving time to do?

> In truth, this is just how we are convinced to give up on living. As Lewis Mumford [put it](https://substack.com/redirect/57238455-bc29-45d9-81a6-c700e3e81dbe?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) in 1964, “Under the pretext of saving labor, the ultimate end of this technics is to displace life, or rather, to transfer the attributes of life to the machine and the mechanical collective, allowing only so much of the organism to remain as may be controlled and manipulated.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h08xzrvsecn2qy0rbz2p0qbv))


> We come to understand our own experience according to the logic of techno-economic order. We presume that our worth is bound up with our productivity. We enter into an adversarial relationship with time. We develop a distaste for rest. We forget how to play. Our relationships are instrumentalized. The world becomes to us, in [Hartmut Rosa’s](https://substack.com/redirect/8087f015-26cc-41be-bfc2-de8974ed98fd?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) memorable phrase, nothing more than a series of points of aggressions, “all matters to be settled, attended to, mastered, completed, resolved, gotten out of the way.” In this mode, we will always seize upon the time-saving promise, however hollow, and our life will be ruled by the tyranny of tiny tasks because we will never be doing something for its own sake.

> The question, then, is this: how do we refuse this tyranny and embrace instead a form of life that makes it plausible for us to speak of what Borgmann called fidelity to daily tasks? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h08y5vb61jarcgs1zqkxxh28))


> Secondly, we should be suspicious of the presumption that how something gets done is a matter of indifference and that what is of real consequence is only the end or the output. This presumption sustains the belief that any part of a process or practice can be automated or eliminated without affecting or jeopardizing the integrity of the whole enterprise, in part because it entails the belief that all that ever matters is the outcome of the process and not the meaning of the process or how we are shaped by it. Under certain circumstances it may, in fact, be true that how something gets done is a matter of relative unimportance, but this is far from universally true. While the techno-economic order knows only quantifiable outcomes and measurable outputs, much of what ultimately matters, what is of greatest human concern, transpires in the particular and idiosyncratic ways we pursue our goals—in the ways we are involved, invested, and engaged in the tasks that make up our days.

> Within this system and by its terms, we do best to waste as much time as possible, to slow down when we are encouraged to speed up, to disregard the demand to measure and assess, to relish inefficiency, to remember, as my friend Evan Selinger [once](https://substack.com/redirect/3ee6828b-505f-4fb7-9bfb-9b79ac9961e0?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) put it, that “effort is the currency of care.” And such effort is best not “saved,” because our living is bound up with our caring.
