## Highlights

> Body-awareness relies on the representation of both interoceptive and exteroceptive percepts coming from one’s body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx7yp983sz7z17fqtwqw9fd))

> The results suggest that interoceptive sensitivity predicts the malleability of body representations, that is, people with low interoceptive sensitivity experienced a stronger illusion of owner- ship in the RHI. Importantly, this effect was not simply owing to a poor proprioceptive representation or differences in autonomic states of one’s body prior to the multi-sensory stimulation, suggesting that interoceptive awareness modulates the online integration of multi-sensory body-percepts.

> Interoception, deﬁned here as the sense of the physiological condition of the body, is a ubiquitous information channel used to represent one’s body from within [6] ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx8gtg6f49tx3grqw1332rc))

> Interoceptive awareness is usually considered a trait, and as such it may also be linked to speciﬁc personality traits. For example, previous studies have shown that indi- viduals who score higher on neuroticism-related personality measures show greater interoceptive aware- ness [16–18]. However, other studies have suggested a link between interceptive awareness and blood pressure, with untreated newly diagnosed hypertensives showing higher interoceptive sensitivity [19]. Given that blood pressure cannot be considered a trait, this observation questions the characterization of interoceptive awareness as a trait.

> What can account for the ﬁnding that low intero- ceptive sensitivity results in greater malleability of body-representations following multi-sensory stimu- lation? There are two possible explanations. First, it might be possible that individuals with low interoceptive sensitivity can allocate more attentional resources to multi-sensory processing because they are less aware of their internal states, resulting in a stronger multi-sensory integration and consequently a stronger RHI. A similar account has been proposed from RHI studies on schizo- phrenic patients [21,22]. However, it was recently shown that, if anything, high interoceptive awareness positively correlates with better performance in attention tasks [23]. A second explanation would suggest that high interoceptive sensitivity might contribute to an over- all more efﬁcient processing of body-related sensory percepts by the co-weighting of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals during body-perception, in contrast to individuals with low interoceptive sensitivity who might rely mainly on exteroceptive signals. People with high interoceptive sensitivity may display enhanced moni- toring of the origins of body-related percepts, and may map these percepts against the available interoceptive rep- resentations of the internal milieu.
