## Highlights

> One of the questions I always ask of stories is how they *work*. Who do they serve? Who benefits? Who, if anyone, is burdened or harmed by them? Who is uplifted? What modes or methods or structures do they employ? Stories—and metaphors, which are often just stories in miniature—are never neutral actors. They always seek some change, whether through resistance or encouragement or both. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw71hjhmxg9d2h5yh8xxv48n))


> But there’s a different story I want to talk about today, and it’s a timely one: this story says that a certain kind of technology is different from all other technologies by virtue of its *wit*. Where other machines merely follow the instructions given them, this new kind of machine learns and discovers and creates novel and surprising results. This tech is so smart that there’s in fact a risk that it becomes *too* smart and gains sentience—a possibility so dangerous it requires that we rapidly expand the capability of this technology so that we have a chance to stay a few steps ahead of it, so that we have a chance to make certain it serves us instead of itself.

> I’m talking about machine learning. Which is itself one kind of story—one in which machines do something like “learn,” but which really means to memorize or put into storage, and includes nothing so pedestrian as understanding or interpreting. But the more common parlance—“artificial intelligence”—expands on that story to suggest that not only are the machines learning, but they have acquired the ability to *think*, or to intellectualize, implying that they have desires and personalities and behaviors. One way this story works is that by ascribing “thinking” to the machines, it triggers associations many people have with “higher” beings—whether species that are smarter than others, or people that are. (I’ll come back to this hierarchical notion of intelligence in a moment.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw71mamg6y8tdma0e2wr845q))

> Another way this story works is that it embeds a notion of a hierarchy of intelligence within it. The risk isn’t that AI is smart—it’s right there in the name, we made it to be like that—the risk is that it becomes *too* smart, so smart it is either capable of destroying humankind or becomes so uncaring it sees us as mere ants in its path (or both). This presumes, first, that intelligence is quantifiable and, second, that more of it is better. Leaving aside whether or not either of those things are true,[1](https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/smoke-screen#fn20230321-1) the question then becomes *how* would we measure that intelligence accurately, and *through what political lens*. By way of illustration, consider that our typical methods for measuring intelligence—IQ tests and various university-style examinations—rarely if ever consider someone’s ability to, say, effectively deescalate a violent encounter, or interpret body language within and across cultures, or sit meditatively without looking at one’s phone every ten seconds. Those skills are positioned, at best, as supplementary to *actual* intelligence (that is, logic and rationality) and are often used to dismissively reference the skills of women and people of color.

> The story that “artificial intelligence” tells is a smoke screen. But smoke offers only temporary cover. It fades if it isn’t replenished. We have the power to tell different stories, to counter the narrative of “artificial intelligence” with one that is rooted in democracy and equality, in a vision of a living world in which life is not ranked according to perceived value under capitalism but in which care is extended to all. But—and here’s the trick of it—in order to do that we have to let go of the notion that any one of us is worth more than any other. Countering the story of so-called AI demands that we relinquish the habit of presuming that some people are deserving of care and some are not, that some people are more intelligent than others, that some kinds of intelligences are superior. This is a challenge, but it is also a gift. The question is, are we ready to accept it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gw72x7vj9m3kpjypaw8svbhf))
