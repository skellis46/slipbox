## Highlights

> The qualitative analysis of these focus groups with
>  representative practitioners of body awareness practices, and the perspectives of their patients, elucidated the
>  common ground of their understanding of body awareness. For them body awareness is an inseparable aspect of
>  embodied self awareness realized in action and interaction with the environment and world. It is the awareness of
>  embodiment as an innate tendency of our organism for emergent self-organization and wholeness. T ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6tsymnex0cyhhj78f3g8m91))

> Body awareness involves an attentional focus on and

>  as we define it here, is the subjective, phenomenological

>  conscious awareness, and is modifiable by mental pro-
>  cesses including attention, interpretation, appraisal,
>  beliefs, memories, conditioning, attitudes and affect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6tt5r30dtajagwgm1hn78he))

> To better understand the conceptualization of body
>  awareness in mind-body therapies that claim to provide
>  benefits from enhancing body awareness, we invited
>  leading practitioners and teaching faculty of these
>  approaches as well as their patients and conducted
>  focus groups. These focus group sessions were con-
>  ducted as one step in the systematic development of a
>  new multi-dimensional self-report measure of body
>  awareness. The contributions of these focus groups to
>  the measure development and the definition of dimen-
>  sions within the construct will be discussed in a later
>  paper. The aim of this paper is to articulate the place
>  and function of body awareness in each of the
>  approaches and how these lead to desired outcomes as
>  narrated by practitioners and patients and, thereby, to
>  gain insights into the concept of body awareness as it is
>  understood theoretically, as it is conveyed in practice,
>  and as it is experienced. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ttdjsxhrcfptb9xqv0baez))

> A central skill that

> The process that patients undergo in these therapies
>  was seen as a progression towards greater unity
>  between body and self, very similar to the conceptuali-
>  zation of embodiment as a dialectic of body and self
>  described by some philosophers as being experienced
>  in four levels [56]: 1) in a level labeled “the lived body”
>  the body is taken for granted, and patients are unself-
>  consciously aware or unaware of it, the body often
>  described as “absent” [57]. This state was well-
>  described by the patients when they began their prac-
>  tices. 2) in a level labeled “theobjectivebodystate” the
>  body is experienced as opposed to the self. Body and
>  self are in tension with each other or in disunity, the
>  body becomes “symptomatic” and the patient describes
>  physical constraints including pain and some degree of
>  loss of function. That state seemed to be the situation
>  that brought the patients into the therapy. 3) A third
>  stage labeled as “cultivated immediacy” was described
>  by practitioners and patients as well: it is experienced
>  as a new relationship to the body characterized by
>  acceptance, immediacy and the body experienced with-
>  out objectification. 4) In the fourth state labeled “the
>  subjective body” thebodyisexperienced as asourceof
>  learning and meaning, by practitioners described as
>  endowed with “intelligence” and an “innate tendency
>  towards embodiment”. In this state the body a) is no
>  longer just the means by which the self carries out its
>  projects or b) the source of constraints and limits to
>  the self’s goals, but rather an integral and equal part of
>  the self and the locus of consciousness and subjectivity
>  with its own perspective [55]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6x67eksk72yxy6yy77s4ddv))

>  not on “the body” as such butonwhatit means to be
>  ‘embodied’ [53,54]. “Embodiment is the human experi-

>  sophical and nursing literature [52,63]. It overcomes
>  the mind-body split, as it still persists in the biomedi-
