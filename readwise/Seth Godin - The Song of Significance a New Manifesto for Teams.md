## Highlights

> I asked ten thousand people in ninety countries to describe the conditions at the best job they ever had. Here are the characteristics they chose most often: The top four items (people could choose more than one answer) overwhelmingly came out ahead: I surprised myself with what I could accomplish I could work independently The team built something important People treated me with respect (Location 208)


> When facing an existential threat, it’s hard to move forward, difficult to create, and challenging to be generous. (Location 244)


> Burnout, dissatisfaction, and the banal parade of meetings conspire to stifle productivity and make work less engaging. We are pushed to seek safety, not increase. Until our existential needs are met, it’s difficult to produce the emotional labor needed for progress and possibility. (Location 252)


> Once their basic needs are met, workers are very clear about what they want from work. It’s not more stock options or a fancier office. It’s much more fundamental: agency and dignity. (Location 271)


> What companies need has shifted, and suddenly. Instead of cheap labor to do the semiautomated tasks that machines can’t do (yet), organizations now seek two apparently scarce resources: creativity and humanity. (Location 285)


> Most of all, though, it’s convenient. That’s the essence of productive consumer-focused industrialism. To create convenience. (Location 309)


> But the stopwatch comes for all of us. If we are going to compete with those who seek the perfection of industrial capitalism, we should know that they will out-measure, out-standardize, and out-manage us. It’s a race to the bottom. The work of significance embraces the very things that industrialism seeks to stamp out. Significance is inconvenient. (Location 322)


> In This Is Marketing, I wrote about the power that comes when we start marketing for people, to solve their problems instead of focusing on our own. The same is true for organizational leadership. No one goes to the gym to willingly get punched in the face by the senior vice president of boxing. But some folks eagerly pay for a sparring partner when it’s time to get better. (Location 348)


> No grades, no check marks, no badges. I’m not in charge of you, and I’m not manipulating you. I’m simply establishing the conditions for you to get to where you said you wanted to go. You tell me where you’re going and what you need. You make promises about your commitment and skills development. I’ll show up to illuminate, question, answer, spar with, and challenge you. I’ll work tirelessly to make sure you’re part of a team of people who are ready to care as much as you do. (Location 352)


> Real value is no longer created by traditional measures of productivity. It’s created by personal interactions, innovation, creative solutions, resilience, and the power of speed. (Location 384)


> So instead of measuring the right thing, we measure awkward proxies for caring. Time in seat. Response to emails. Charisma in meetings. (Location 434)


> How have we grown as an organization and as individuals? What did we learn? (Location 478)


> In the last few years, organizations have discovered that a useful way forward is to ask, “What does the earth want?” Building things that are resilient, light in impact, and more sustainable is a powerful way forward—the opposite of a posture of dominance and waste. The movement is gaining momentum and bringing change with it. The earth is your customer, and many people will be aligned with you as you serve it. (Location 513)


> And the lesson of this manifesto is simple: An organization of any size can effectively move forward by asking, “What do humans need?” What will create significance for those who interact with us? (Location 517)


> The conductor of an orchestra doesn’t make a sound. He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people powerful. Ben Zander, Boston Philharmonic (Location 567)


> The next quadrant is for work that is low stakes but high trust. This is the work of culture creation, of community, of people we care about showing up each day to contribute a bit to the whole. The work is consistent, but it’s human, not industrial. The shifts caused by pandemic disruptions, outsourcing, work from home, and AI have disrupted this quadrant. (Location 577)


>  (Location 585)


> The planet does not need more successful people, but it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers, and lovers of every kind. David Orr (Location 593)


> Of course, people with a soul, people who have a choice, people who seek humanity bristle at this idea of a corporate transaction. If the question is “What do I owe you?,” Margaret Atwood has it right: “The answer is never ‘nothing.’ ” We owe our employees a debt. We owe it to our coworkers. And we owe it to our bosses. Work is the expression of our energy and our dreams. We owe those along for the journey the same dignity and connection we would like to receive in return. (Location 669)


> When Harry Acker was building Sleepy’s (which his son sold to Mattress Firm for nearly a billion dollars), his best technique for growing the business was to call every store every day and ask, “What’s wrong?” and then fix the problem. The store manager who told me this story made it clear that if you didn’t have a problem to share, you were in trouble. (Location 679)


> Patients have a choice—they can pay a few hundred dollars for cataract surgery or have it done for free. Enough patients choose to pay that Aravind is largely self-sufficient. (Location 709)


> It’s tempting to want the easiest and best outputs of both. To promise people dignity and connection and excitement, and then use discipline to get them to do what you want. (Location 744)


> Management is the practice of using power and authority to get what we want. To get the burgers flipped, the packages delivered, the phones answered. Leadership is the art of creating something significant. (Location 791)


> When we embrace the mutual commitments of significance, we create the conditions for a shared understanding that our work, our actual work, is to dance with the fear. And dancing with fear requires significance, tension, and the belief that we’re doing something that matters. (Location 818)


> The employees at Rising Tide have their lives changed and change the lives of others in return. And so do their customers. The business is built on four principles: Feeling of safety Culture of accountability Clear purpose Customer love (Location 836)


> There are legitimate reasons that organizations hit roadblocks. The fatigue of generations-long societal and racial injustice, combined with the indoctrination of industrialism and the unfairness of claiming a meritocracy that doesn’t exist, make it challenging to trust that we’ll ever have a chance to make a difference. Tokenism and lip service aren’t a solution, and sometimes it’s easy to abandon our efforts to make things better. In the face of a threat to our safety, it’s easy to focus on reinforcing that safety. But what choice do we have? The controlling forces of industrial capitalism and the status quo don’t care much about our personal need for agency and significance, and they’ll happily cheer us on if we get stuck focusing on short-term issues. (Location 882)


> Here are some of the traps Mitchell identifies. Our teams need to be aware of them as we seek to make an impact: MAXIMALISM The trap: “If it’s not a perfect solution to the problem, it’s a betrayal of everything we stand for.” ANTI-LEADERSHIP ATTITUDES “Because industrial managers have harmed workers in the past, we need to avoid all leadership, all management, and the constraints they bring.” ANTI-INSTITUTIONAL SENTIMENT “Because some institutions seek to marginalize others and have surveilled their workers, all institutions are to be avoided and undermined. Don’t believe any of their promises.” GLASS HOUSES “If our organization does anything that doesn’t completely fit the humanist model of creation and problem-solving, then we have no business doing anything.” THE SMALL WAR “We can’t possibly take on big issues in the outside world because right here there are arguments to be settled.” UNANCHORED CARE “I came for significance and the feelings of possibility, joy, and connection it brings, and that means the organization has to take care of all of my needs.” DISPROPORTIONALITY “The minor discomfort the team feels right now is the most important issue to be addressed.” SHINY OBJECTS “Getting distracted by individual and personal inclinations is more exciting and ultimately more satisfying than the more arduous journey we signed up for in the first place.” (Location 888)


> The philosopher Hannah Arendt argued that humans have three ways to spend their time. The labor required to feed ourselves and survive. The work of doing a craft that we are proud of. And the action of organization and possibility. For a century, the masses have been pushed to only do labor. But what happens to a world of laborers when the need for labor is sliced so thin, is so measured and so automated that it is no longer needed, no longer satisfying, and no longer useful? Before it’s too late, we need to refocus our efforts on work and action instead. (Location 933)


> Significant organizations are team-centric. Their goal is to make a change happen, and to do that with and for a group of people who care about making an impact. That’s why the smallest viable audience is the engine of marketing in our modern world, and why enrollment from the team is so much more valuable than being a convenient place to work. (Location 945)


> The purpose of a beehive isn’t to make honey: honey is a by-product of a healthy hive. A significant organization can please its customers and make a profit as well. But it begins by earning enrollment and then doing the work to make change happen. (Location 947)


> We’ve reached a point where we’re shifting from How do I get my employees to do what I want? to How do I create the conditions where the team can make the impact it desires? (Location 979)


> Safety is first. It’s impossible to grow, to connect, or to lead if we are under threat or feel the ground shifting beneath us. Next come affiliation and status, an alternating dance of vaguely related emotions. Affiliation is being part of something, fitting in, being connected. And status is simply who eats lunch first. Our place in the order of things. But the real desire is significance. To do something that matters. To be missed if we’re gone. The universal desire to achieve dignity and be seen. (Location 985)


> Tension is the feeling of wanting to be in two places at once. Often that’s the place of safety, where we know everything will be as it was, versus the place of significance, where we can increase our affiliation and increase or maintain our status. (Location 992)


> Tension is not something to avoid. You can’t walk outside on a sunny day without casting a shadow, and you cannot create significance without encountering tension. (Location 994)


> James Daunt Saved the Bookstore (Location 1114)


> This is an example of stigmergy. Not self-organization, but an organization that hears itself, leads together, and creates resilience by embracing the edges, not simply the center. (Location 1120)


> It is the secret fear that we are unlovable that isolates us, but it is only because we are isolated that we think we are unlovable. gabrielle zevin (Location 1141)


> A great restaurant kitchen doesn’t need a chef inspecting every dish and every ingredient. The team is enrolled in owning the quality of what is served. A kitchen run by a control freak might burn brighter for a bit, but it will inevitably burn out. Either the committed and skilled staff will find a kitchen that respects them, or they will succumb to micromanagement and eventually stop caring. (Location 1153)


> Our job is to create a change, to make things better, to show up with something that was worth the effort it took to create. Profit may be a by-product of our work, but it’s not the only way we measure it. (Location 1175)


> If we keep measuring the wrong things, we’ll keep getting the things we don’t want. (Location 1179)


> Each meeting should last exactly as long as it takes to deliver on the intention of the meeting. And if a meeting doesn’t have an intention, it should be canceled. (Location 1182)


> When people feel seen and are given the chance to make a difference, they often do. Supporting human dignity is more than a moral obligation. It’s also a competitive advantage. (Location 1192)


> Centralized decision-making is usually slow and ineffective when it’s time to offer action and solutions to local, decentralized customer needs, particularly in fast-moving environments. If employees are unable to act without direction, they won’t act without direction. (Location 1238)


> Organizations that understand how to improve the work without undermining the worker create more value. (Location 1251)


> If we’re already living in a gig culture, it’s productive to embrace it. We can say to our team, “Join us if it works for you, leave us when it doesn’t. And if you leave with more knowledge than when you came, it’s a symptom that we did well together.” (Location 1275)


> When a regime of obedience, compliance, and “have to” steps in, our reasons for caring evaporate. Instead, we’re defensively trying to do the minimum to avoid rebuke, not leaning into what might be possible. (Location 1296)


> When we do the work when the boss isn’t looking, we’re adhering to standards. But if our behavior changes when we’re under surveillance, that’s simply because we’ve been harassed into tolerating the performance of obedience. (Location 1303)


> If you’re not making decisions, there’s little point in understanding the systems, inputs, and leverage points involved in your job. You can simply do what you’re told. (Location 1311)


> Your opinion isn’t nearly as important as how you came to your decision. Your status in the hierarchy doesn’t matter if you can’t show us your work. (Location 1327)


> By clearly stating our intentions, methods, and measurements, it may seem like we open ourselves up to criticism. Actually, we’re holding our work up for improvement, which couldn’t be more different. When your work improves, so does your reputation—and with it, your options and your status. (Location 1328)


> Studies show that when we ask people, anywhere in the world, “How could this be different?” more than 90 percent of respondents will suggest something to make it better. It’s in our nature to improve things. Regardless of whether we designed them ourselves, or perhaps precisely because we didn’t design them ourselves. There are three simple steps: Do the reading Ship the improvement Show your work (Location 1334)


> We give too little respect to the other skills when we call them “soft” and imply that they’re optional. (Location 1352)


> Organizations give feedback on vocational skill output daily and save the other stuff for the annual review, if they measure it at all. And organizations hire and fire based on vocational skill output all the time, but they practically need an act of the board to get rid of a negative thinker, a bully, or a sloth (if he’s good at something measurable). (Location 1358)


> If you’re wondering why the opportunities you seek aren’t materializing, it might be worth looking hard not at the skills that are easy to measure, but at the ones that are important to have. (Location 1361)


> If an employee at your organization took home a brand-new laptop every day, you’d have them arrested or at least fired. If your bookkeeper were embezzling money every month, you’d do the same thing. But when an employee demoralizes the entire team by undermining a project, or when a team member checks out and doesn’t pull his weight, or when a bully causes future stars to quit the organization—too often we shrug and point out that this person has tenure, or key vocational skills, or really isn’t so bad. But they’re stealing from us. The “us” is the key word. (Location 1370)


> Writing in the Harvard Business Review, Lou Solomon reports that 69 percent of managers are uncomfortable communicating with their employees. I’d guess that many of the other 31 percent are lying. (Location 1404)


> Communicating with employees is uncomfortable because we’ve built systems of compliance and dominance that make it difficult. We ask people to leave their humanity at the door, then use authority to change behavior. We overlay corporate greed and short-term thinking on a human desire to create work that matters. (Location 1406)


> How do we build people-centric organizations while also accepting the fact that two thirds of our managers (presumably well paid, well trained, and integral to our success) are so uncomfortable doing an essential part of their job that they admitted it to a stranger? (Location 1408)


> The foundation of all real skills is this one: the confidence and permission to talk to one another. Not to manage, belittle, intimidate, or control. Simply to seek to be understood, and to do the work to understand. Once (Location 1413)


> We don’t need a coach as much as we need to want to be coached. (Location 1426)


> Decades ago, a student told him that she was enrolling in law school. The reason? Because, as we see in the first scene of the movie The Paper Chase, the professors cold call on the students. Without warning, at any time, any student can be called upon to speak. His student was attracted to this because it meant that in every class, everyone was prepared, everyone was listening, and everyone was actually part of the classroom experience. As a result, she’d learn more. She wanted to be in a room with people who wanted to be in the room. From that inspiration, Brighouse decided to incorporate cold calling (which he calls “warm calling”) into his small-group undergraduate classes. His cold calling is not a surprise or a threat or a hack. (Location 1430)


> Survivor’s relief rarely leads to powerful innovation and resilience. It’s simply a shortcut that only works when the world stays the same. “The beatings will continue until morale improves” has never been a useful slogan. (Location 1443)


> Our goal in making change with our work is to help our customers and coworkers become what they seek. This requires empathy. The empathy to realize that others don’t know what we know, want what we want, or see what we see. And the empathy to understand that the work we do isn’t for us, it’s for someone else. (Location 1464)


> Our relationships are a result of our ability to listen. And when we listen, we earn trust and create connection. But only if we care enough to dance with our fear. (Location 1471)


> When we listen, we enter into a relationship—an agreement that we bind ourselves to. In this relationship, we learn how to live in reciprocal respect with all that surrounds us, both the seen and the unseen. We must live in a state of active relationship, not only taking but also giving back. This giving back may take literal form or manifest itself in observing, learning, and gently interacting. If we listen, those stories are always available to us. All those around us—the plants, animals, trees, water, air—are our patient and willing teachers. We must remain open to this knowledge that is so willingly shared with us so long as we listen. Christine Luckasavitch, Algonquin and mixed settler educator (Location 1472)


> Sonder is the name for a realization that eventually hits each of us: other people have noise in their heads like we have noise in our heads. And one way we deal with our noise is in the words we choose to say (or don’t say). And one way that people deal with their noise is by how they choose to hear the words we say. We think we’re communicating, but we’re really not. Often, significant work requires us to develop more empathy than we might be comfortable with. Our understanding might not be their understanding. We can acknowledge that others didn’t hear what we said the way we said it. Or realize that perhaps the person we’re engaging with said something other than the words we’re sure were uttered. (Location 1480)


> Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power. abraham lincoln (Location 1508)


> 101. What We Produce Is Change And the way we produce it is by making decisions. But decisions are difficult, because decisions are always about the future, and they always involve other people. There’s a huge difference between the backward-looking work of quality improvement and the forward-looking dance of making decisions about what happens next. If you’re not willing to produce change, then you really have no options. Cost-reduction through industrial management is your only path forward. (Location 1511)


> Hurt People Hurt People (Location 1573)


> Connection is easy to break. As we assemble networks and come together to build projects, the people who join us are all coming from somewhere else, having done something else. And we all carry the muscles and the scar tissue that develop from living for more than a few minutes. Significant work involves tension, change, and the transitions of starting and finishing. What we’ve done will change what we do. What we do will change who we are. And the cycle continues. (Location 1574)


> All the people we work with have histories, lives, and stories. It’s so easy to avoid all of that and simply build barriers. So easy to refuse to acknowledge who is sitting right next to us. (Location 1585)


> But when we’re seeking change, when we’re inventing the future, we don’t have something easy to measure, so we naturally seek reassurance. The only desired answer to the rhetorical “How am I doing?” is GREAT! Which isn’t much help if you seek to do better. Not false proxies. Not personal attacks. Not a remedy for what ails you, or a chance to vent your feelings. Simply feedback that helps us move forward, please. (Location 1591)


> We’ve been seduced by the false promises of industrial capitalism to focus on convenience, productivity, profit, and compliance. Perhaps it’s worth changing our vocabulary as we try to rewire our culture for a new way forward: Affiliation Connection Creation Dignity Discovery Enrollment Fear Generosity Honesty Joy Leadership Learning Long-term Personal Possibility Resilience Resistance Safety Significant Status Tension Trust Volunteer (Location 1639)


> If we walk far enough, we shall sometime come to someplace. dorothy gale (Location 1660)


> If We Make Decisions . . . Then let’s acknowledge that decisions are far more important than tasks. (Location 1677)


> Actions speak louder than meetings. lee clow (Location 1691)


> In-person meetings are now like caviar, rare and precious. And yet we waste them. (Location 1702)


> Industrial management doesn’t particularly embrace conversations. Conversations are hard to control and plan for. And to work well, they need a level of parity and connection that undermines the hierarchy of bosses giving instructions. That’s why industrial organizations prefer meetings. They’re more efficient at what they set out to do. Because industrial meetings don’t involve much meeting. They’re actually group lectures with a few moments for Q&A. (Location 1706)


> The truth is simple: The meeting culture was designed to exert control and to simulate a shortcut on the difficult path to actual connection. But most meetings aren’t very good, because no one ever put in the emotional labor to construct real-time meetings that produced the outcome that was needed. There’s nothing wrong with meetings. There’s a lot wrong with meetings that are lazy, ineffective, or manipulative. (Location 1759)


> It’s a conversation in which everyone listens and speaks. Only the people who need to be there are there. It leads to a decision, not the delivery of information. It creates energy, it doesn’t destroy it. (Location 1775)


> If you promise not to check your email while we’re talking, we promise to not waste your time. (Location 1779)


> The purpose is to communicate an idea and the emotions that go with it, and to find out what’s missing via engaged conversation. If we can’t do that, let’s not meet. Multitasking (especially during meetings) isn’t productive, respectful, or healthy. Being present in real time is a waste unless we interact. Reaffirming your status and control isn’t worth an hour of my day. (Location 1783)


> Your culture is more powerful than your strategy or your tactics. Combine “what things are like around here” with “people like us do things like this,” and quite suddenly your team has leverage beyond the industrialist’s imagination. (Location 1860)


> In fact, innovative performance is almost always related to random events (good or bad), and innovations can always be improved. Valuable contributors aren’t consistently right, they’re consistently contributing. (Location 1902)


> Cory Doctorow has written eloquently about adversarial interoperability. It’s a system that is open enough that other organizations and individuals can use it without permission. (Location 1917)


> when people trust you, they give you the benefit of the doubt. That means that when something is confusing or mysterious or simply new, people assume that it’s a good thing that they don’t understand (yet), not a threat that they should be wary of. (Location 1930)


> Alexander Technique teacher Tommy Thompson suggests that when we encounter the unexpected or the unknown, we embrace the tension and withhold putting the new situation into a familiar box. (Location 1939)


> But these easy measurements can be a crutch, and we may end up failing to talk about the things that really matter. Looking at the past (what we did and how we measured it) is a good place to begin, but our work is to consider the future—messier, murkier, and far more magical—instead. (Location 1953)


> We end up hiring people who are good at being interviewed, as opposed to those who would be useful additions to the team. (Location 1985)


> Almost all the systems we rely on to hire and to be hired are wired around the old model of hiring as a dating process. (Location 1988)


> Instead of hiring based on the performance of interview skills, perhaps we can pay people to do a project with us. The best way to see how someone works is to work with them. (Location 1995)


> Bosses lie when they try to hire. Employees get their revenge by lying when they answer. Bosses pretend that they have a fascinating, humane environment that prizes individuality, while selecting people who have demonstrated that this isn’t their goal. And employees swallow their pride when they need a job, because that’s what they’ve been trained to do. (Location 2003)


> The tension changes that. Significance creates change, and change is a dance with tension. (Location 2018)


> I bring you the gift of these four words: I believe in you. blaise pascal (Location 2033)


> We live in a world of eight billion people now, and each one (or at least every person I’ve met) has done something original, creative, important, and generous. At least once, and often more. (Location 2080)


> I am not a number. John DRAKE (Location 2108)


> WISDOM Artistic sense and good taste Conflict resolution instincts Creativity in the face of challenges Critical thinking instead of mere compliance Dealing with difficult people Diplomacy in difficult situations Empathy for customers, coworkers, and vendors Intercultural competence Mentoring Social skills Supervising with confidence (Location 2154)
