> The ageism around clubbing is unquestioned. A recent survey into when people stop going dancing [found we retreat at about 37](https://www.kentlive.news/news/kent-news/too-old-clubbing-age-survey-2833906). Walking past the queues outside clubs in London it looks more like 25 to me. The thought of standing there, at the age of 58, waiting to be scrutinised by the door team, makes my stomach scrunch imagining the humiliation of rejection.

> And yet dancing is an extraordinarily healthy activity for mature people. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine [found dance to be the best physical activity](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa022252) for reducing the risk of dementia. Obviously, it is good for the heart and lungs, but it has also been shown to help with depression, improve balance and boost self-esteem.

> Improvised bobbing and bouncing to a beat feels unlike any other movement. You are lost in a flow-like state. According to Dr Peter Lovatt, author of The [Dance](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance) Cure, dancing allows the mind release from day-to-day concerns and interrupts negative looping thoughts.

> Beneath my disguise as midlife professional, parent and husband, I am a clubber, I have always been a clubber. I have just learned to keep it secret. When you’re 58 you *only* dance when no one’s looking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyw83vq2e2ck045tgham0mbq))


> I started as a teenager in east London venues haunted by violence. I was supposed to be looking for romantic encounters, but instead I just followed the beats, possessed by [Chic](https://www.theguardian.com/music/nile-rodgers) and Tom Browne, eyes closed, unconstrained and fearless. I had discovered who I really was. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyw845z93t6gejn5mjj57ptg))


> At each of these life stages, I remember the feeling of being utterly at peace as I moved. Catching an eye and looking away, at one with the people on the floor but also in my own place of bliss. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyw86zt1j56t6260gsjdcnkj))


> We are young again when we do this. It’s time travel. I get that it’s funny to the young, who know how to dance as it’s done now, but I’m appealing for a reset. There is beauty in seeing someone’s body rejuvenated by a piece of music. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyw87x8qs6yjyqpxxcn0yc9x))


> Above all, we need to win the battle with our own self-consciousness, the internalised biases – we need to stop the self-mocking ironic shuffle and dance. It’s high time we were all lost in music once again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyw889smdxy54vddebncgf35))
