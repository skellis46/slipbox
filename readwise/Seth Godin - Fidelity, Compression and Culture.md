## Highlights

> Lossy compression is forever. Information was intentionally removed. What you hear isn’t what the artist heard in the studio, and all the equipment in the world can’t restore it. On the other hand, math and computers can now often give us reversible compression, but that’s a different discussion. We compress information because smaller files give us a chance for higher fidelity and cheaper networking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa1wdygsy17hs04nhvcgt0d))


> High fidelity means that each copy is what we expect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa1wj40x61spq30pgc4nwcb))


> Lossless compression (or no compression) means that we haven’t left anything out in order to get the fidelity or sharing to work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa1wp67m69yjr8ns8n8qvt2))


> Packaged food companies and makers of [cheap chocolate](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/sethsblog/~https://seths.blog/2019/09/dont-buy-cheap-chocolate/) prize the consistency of high fidelity (every bar is the same, if lousy) over the magic of something special. So they blend ingredients and dumb down the recipes so it’s always the same. This compression isn’t done in error, it’s something they work hard on.

> A Broadway show is high fidelity when you see it, but that disappears if you try to save it. You have to be there live, a reference recording on video isn’t the same. Telling someone about the show is not the same as seeing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa1x5wbnetkyp76jwkkra9a))


> Gossip is compressed and low fidelity news of the community, and both get worse as it spreads. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsa1xefp8jfdkg4yx4v03spz))


> And meetings? Meetings at work are largely low fidelity and ultimately quite compressed. Unlike a memo that can be in and of itself, a meeting is a performance, and then it’s summarized, and summarized again, until it becomes a story that’s a shadow of what the person who started the whole thing had in mind. Nuance disappears. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbew671aj830svm2ehftrsj))


> As [Jeff Jarvis](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/sethsblog/~https://buzzmachine.com/2023/02/12/journalism-is-lossy-compression/) points out, GPT and other AI chatbots are essentially lossy compression mechanisms for the web. They read the entire web and compress it on demand into a few paragraphs. Like Cliffs Notes, one of the problems of this convenience is that it can’t be uncompressed. The nuance disappears and is difficult to reconstruct. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbewkzkb4927peeeksc65dm))

> Lossy compression is forever. Fidelity is a powerful delight. Stories spread and resonate, but by their nature compress the truth of what we just encountered. A novel is the author’s complete telling of the story the way they chose to tell it, while history books and journalism always compress what actually happened.

> And now, AI redefines fidelity altogether, sometimes embellishing what was there before and presenting something that might mistakenly be seen as a high fidelity original. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbeygp7m9gz480cyx0wzq1d))
