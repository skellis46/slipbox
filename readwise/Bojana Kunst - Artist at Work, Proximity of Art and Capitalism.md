> This antagonism can be briefly described as a contradiction between the forceful desire to create political and critical art, and the meek, almost ‘martyr-like’ recognition of the total appropriation of art by capitalism; ([Location 38](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015GF37SK&location=38))

> Art is thus in an interesting relationship with the functioning of contemporary capitalism which saturates all pores of social life: the criticism and the provocativeness of art seem to be a part of the exploitation of human powers.

> It is the speculation about the ostensible freedom of artistic life that conceals the erasure of art from public space and increases the invisibility of its material and community processes. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015GF37SK&location=77))

> We live at a time when creativity, a wish for change and constant reflection on creative conditions are the driving forces behind development in the post-industrial world, marked by the need to constantly revolutionize methods of production and creativity.

> According to Slavoj Žižek, we now live in a world where pseudo-activity rather than passivity poses the basic threat. ([Location 116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015GF37SK&location=116))

> The need for political art has never been at the foreground to the extent it is now; art has been called upon to comment on, document, discover and address political themes, as well as to actively intertwine with social and political participation processes.

> Isn’t the art of today deeply ingrained into the method of expertly managing social interests, a part of the contemporary urgency for ceaseless activity? ([Location 129](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015GF37SK&location=129))

> Act, be active, participate, always be ready for opposition, generate new ideas, pay attention to contexts while constantly reflecting on your methods of production… Doesn’t all that stand for the activity that profoundly defines the so-called post-political condition?

> “It is better to do nothing than to contribute to the invention of formal ways of rendering visible that which Empire already recognises as existent.”4 The art of today seems to be generated in this field in-between pseudo-activity and the quest for a real effect; ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015GF37SK&location=138))

> I will show that, in order to critically understand this intertwinement of art and politics and also take a step forward from bemoaning the powerlessness of art, we need to rethink the relationship between art and ways of working. The ways in which the artist works today and the things produced by the artist’s work place art intimately close to capitalism.

> Quite the opposite: the spectator communities are mainly articulated as pre-established moral communities that are formed along the dividing line between good and evil, where one’s friends are suddenly separated from one’s enemies.

> Here, the performance always questions and addresses the spectators in their role, leading them “to reflect upon their history, their taste, their capacity to perceive, the frames of references they should mobilize in order to be able to read the performance.” ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015GF37SK&location=222))

> this means that it is aware of the production relationships within which it is generated and works towards emancipating these conditions. This emancipation of one’s production conditions, the constant reflection on the models and protocols of production, is tightly connected to the contemporary models of production in the post-industrialised era.

> politics is an activity that breaks up this unity of processes and interferes with the orderly configuration of the sensual. This makes politics profoundly linked to change; politics “is first and foremost a conflict regarding the scene in common, regarding the existence and status of those who are present there”.
