## Highlights

> But while my fears have been heightened by these developments, they are not grounded in the power of the AI tool itself or the belief that these tools are on the path to sentience. Rather, they are grounded in two far more mundane beliefs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszzn3mhasfre23rf50evxa8))


> First, that human beings are fundamentally social creatures, who desire to know and be known in the context of meaningful human relationships, ideally built on trust and mutual respect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszzn58dcqdychrjyvvqbs1m))


> Second, that we live in an age of increasing loneliness and isolation in which, for far too many people, this profound human need is not being adequately met. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszzn6yjcdv0qhzzkkfe11fb))


> We anthropomorphize because we do not want to be alone. Now we have powerful technologies, which appear to be finely calibrated to exploit this core human desire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gszzp2rbea3xkmxvnhkkh1wq))


> In a recent conversation, a friend, reflecting on ChatGPT’s confident indifference to the truth, which is to say their widely noted capacity for [bullshitting](https://substack.com/redirect/32b53c5c-7c33-4d41-a5fe-ad374bb60a9f?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) , referred to the chatbot as an AI-powered sophist. ⁴ It recalled my own [reference](https://substack.com/redirect/bfee71f8-8b5a-4a45-b7d8-ebf5204eec75?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) a few years back to how “data sophistry,” ever more sophisticated if not obviously successful efforts at data-driven persuasion, had captured the political process. The ancient sophists, however we judge them, understood that language was our most powerful tool for communication and persuasion. To harness the power of language was to acquire the power to steer the affairs of the community. Of course, in Plato’s view, the sophist’s indifference to the truth, the boast that they could argue either side of an argument with equal skill and vigor, made them a threat to the social order.

> It seems useful to frame AI-powered chatbots as a new class of automated sophists, whose indifference to either the true or the good, indeed, their utter lack of intentions, whether malicious or benign, coupled with their capacity to manipulate human language makes them a potential threat to human society and human well-being, particularly when existing social structures have generated such widespread loneliness, isolation, anxiety, and polarization.

> From this perspective, I remain foolishly committed to the idea that our best hope lies still in the cultivation of friendship and community through the practice of hospitality. “If I had to choose one word to which hope can be tied,” the social critic Ivan Illich once explained, “it is hospitality.” “A practice of hospitality,” he added, “recovering threshold, table, patience, listening, and from there generating seedbeds for virtue and friendship on the one hand. On the other hand radiating out for possible community, for rebirth of community.” I recognize that this seems wholly inadequate as a response to the challenges we face, but I also think it is, in the literal sense of getting at the root (or *radix* ) of things, the most radical solution we can pursue.
