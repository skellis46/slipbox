## Highlights

> Extractivism, Carlos explained, was the true heart of the problem: a model of development in which countries gain wealth by extracting substances from the earth; governments stay in power by promising their citizens they will benefit from that wealth; wealth is itself understood in primarily materialistic terms; the living world is seen as a set of resources for (some) humans; and both humans and other than humans are instrumentalised and treated as expendable externalities should they get in the way.

> Carlos’ view was that the companies are themselves part of economic and political systems – our systems – that don’t just embody but compel exactly these insane, life-destroying priorities. Extractivism, he said, is about worldviews as much as about particular industries, and we’ll never protect biodiversity or effectively tackle any of our deeply interconnected environmental and social issues while it holds sway across the world, unless and until we displace it.

> It was the French activist and thinker Malcolm Ferdinand that helped put all this in context for me, a European cycling through colonised countries. Ferdinand writes that colonialism is not just as a practice from a historical era, but ‘a certain way of inhabiting the earth, from some believing themselves entitled to appropriate the earth for the benefit of a few … a violent way of inhabiting the earth, subjugating lands, humans and non-humans to the desires of the coloniser.’ He calls it ‘colonial habitation’, an entire mindset, a way of being in the world based on hierarchy, appropriation and a sense of entitlement. A sense of entitlement so strong it ‘justifies’ the relentless pursuit of material wealth no matter that wild ecosystems, entire communities of living beings, are destroyed; that water is rendered undrinkable; that rivers are drained; that local people are displaced and activists dispensed with; that biodiversity plummets.

> For me, the question has become not so much what to do as how to be. The legacy of colonialism, vivid in extractivism and other forms of colonial habitation, is alive and well. What other ways of inhabiting the earth can we in the industrialised west learn from, foster and pursue? How can we best throw our weight into urgently needed systemic change, and live the values and priorities that change must manifest?
