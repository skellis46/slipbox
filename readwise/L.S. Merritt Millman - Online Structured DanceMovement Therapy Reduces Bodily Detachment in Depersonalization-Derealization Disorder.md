## Highlights

> DMT or creative movement can have a positive impact on health and
>  wellbeing in both physical and mental health conditions including de­
>  mentia, Parkinson’s disease, and depression [1], with a core feature of
>  DMT being the observation of ones’ own body and attending to physi­
>  ological signals and physical boundaries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2daak5j30z6x9zs9mcs9zxh))


> Experiences of disembodiment and detachment from one’s body in
>  DDD may partly reflect altered [17] or deficient [18–20] interoceptive
>  processing. Interoception is a sense of awareness of one’s own body and
>  its internal states and sensations [21] and encompasses dissociable di­
>  mensions of accuracy, awareness, and sensibility [22]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dab7k7key5g8xahrxf83x3))


> The body awareness (BA) task, rooted in principles of body scanning and
>  somatic practices, explicitly directs attention towards the body, whereas
>  the dance exercise (DE) task, focused on aerobic physical dance move­
>  ment, implicitly boosts the salience of bodily signals. We were interested
>  in determining, in the context of DDD, if it is more effective to explicitly
>  focus on bodily sensations, or to implicitly enhance the salience of
>  bodily signals through dance-based exercise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2daks7h3z74v2a2th4m48ta))


> Finally, the use of two
>  dance tasks, instead of one dance task and a no-intervention control
>  group, allows us to control for the influence of physical exercise [1,39]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dap9v7fygr18cjmpdwqpaj))


> Impor­
>  tantly, self-reported interoceptive awareness, which does not necessarily
>  correlate with interoceptive accuracy [29], has – to our knowledge – not
>  yet been assessed in DDD [30]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dafer6xp5bqdpgeb59bc7c))


> A central feature of DDD is the experience of physiological numbing
>  and a sense of detachment between one’s sense of self and their body
>  [16]. Talking therapies may be less likely to address this fundamental
>  aspect of the disorder. Instead, “… treatment should focus on grounding
>  and orientation to the self and the here and now” [7]; p. 468).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dahpacgjd98f2bfzpefv6x))

> The Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ [44]) is a 16-item
>  scale measuring the vividness or intensity of imagined visual scenes. The
>  16 items (α = 0.95) comprise four groups of four items, with each item
>  rated on a five-point Likert scale (1: “perfectly clear and vivid as normal
>  vision” to 5: “no image at all, you only ‘know’ that you are thinking of
>  the object”) with scores ranging from 16 to 80. Each group of items
>  presents a different scenario, and the respondent is asked to rate the
>  vividness of specific details within each scenario. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6rac1y6jnc1mph7447n4by4))

> The Goldsmiths Dance Sophistication Index (Gold-DSI [45]) is a
>  26-item self-report scale that measures participatory and observational
>  dance experience. The participatory factor has one general factor and
>  four subscales, and observational dance training has only one factor.
>  Higher overall scores indicate increased experience and engagement
>  with dance. This measure and its subscales showed high internal con­
>  sistency (α = 0.94; body awareness: α = 0.87; urge to dance: α = 0.92;
>  social dancing: α = 0.80; dance training: α = 0.83). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6rae4xdmqhg19w36m9je055))

> The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS [46]) is a 29-item
>  self-administered questionnaire designed to measure trait DD experi­
>  ences. Respondents rate the frequency (0 [“never”] – 4 [“all the time”])
>  and duration (0 [“few seconds”] – 6 [“more than a week”]) of these
>  different experiences in the preceding six months. As this research is
>  concerned with week-to-week changes in symptoms, and the CDS is the
>  most suitable and specific validated questionnaire to assess DDD
>  symptoms, the instructions for this questionnaire were adjusted to ask
>  respondents about their symptoms in the preceding week. It should be
>  noted that the psychometric properties of using the questionnaire in this
>  way are unknown. Frequency and duration scores are summed across all
>  items, with a total scoring range of 0–290. The cut-off score for a clinical
>  diagnosis of DDD in 80% of cases is 70 [46]. This measure displayed high
>  internal consistency overall (α = 0.97). Based on a previous factor
>  analysis (Sierra et al., 2005), we also calculated scores for the Anoma­
>  lous Body Experience subscale (9 items; α = 0.93). Given the focus of the
>  dance/movement tasks and central research questions within this study,
>  we were particularly interested in examining the impact of the two tasks
>  on anomalous body experiences more specifically. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6rajcy5q6yf53ay8e8e7e29))


+++++ 
- Note: p.3 Curious about anomalous body experience subscale


> Higher scores,
>  both overall and on individual subscales, are indicative of increased
>  body awareness. High internal consistency was seen for each subscale:
>  Noticing (4 items; α = 0.76), Not Distracting (6 items; α = 0.89), Not
>  Worrying (5 items; α = 0.81), Attention Regulation (7 items; α = 0.89),
>  Emotional Awareness (5 items; α = 0.86), Self-Regulation (4 items; α =
>  0.86), Body Listening (3 items; α = 0.89), and Trusting (3 items; α =
>  0.90). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6ran5vwqdw61nhkdsa0sd0g))

> The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ [48]) is a 39-item
>  scale with five facets measuring trait mindfulness in everyday life.
>  Each of the 39 items is rated on a Likert scale of 1 (“never or very rarely
>  true”) to 5 (“very often or always true”). Total scores and individual
>  facet scores were calculated. As with the CDS, the instructions for this
>  questionnaire were adjusted to ask respondents about these statements
>  across the preceding week. Higher scores indicate increased mindful­
>  ness. This scale displayed high internal consistency overall (α = 0.92)
>  and for each facet: Observing (8 items; α = 0.81), Describing (8 items; α
>  = 0.86), Acting with Awareness (8 items; α = 0.91), Non-Judging (8
>  items; α = 0.93), and Non-Reactivity (7 items; α = 0.81). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6rap5ts12n34ajgawb74qwh))

> The Body Vigilance Scale (BVS [49]) is a four-item (α = 0.78)
>  self-report assessment of one’s sensitivity to and attentional focus on
>  internal bodily sensations across the previous week. The first three items
>  assess how much attention is paid to bodily sensations and how sensitive
>  one is to changes in bodily sensations from 1 (“not at all”) to 10
>  (“extremely”), and the average amount of time spent, per day, scanning
>  for bodily sensations from 0 (“no time”) to 100 (“all of the time”). The
>  fourth item asks for ratings of how much attention is paid to 15 different
>  bodily sensations, from dizziness to feeling detached from the self, on a
>  scale of 0 (“none”) to 10 (“extreme”). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6raqj8msvdespnhhe80cy4d))
