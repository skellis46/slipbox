## Highlights

> DMT or creative movement can have a positive impact on health and
>  wellbeing in both physical and mental health conditions including de­
>  mentia, Parkinson’s disease, and depression [1], with a core feature of
>  DMT being the observation of ones’ own body and attending to physi­
>  ological signals and physical boundaries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2daak5j30z6x9zs9mcs9zxh))


> Experiences of disembodiment and detachment from one’s body in
>  DDD may partly reflect altered [17] or deficient [18–20] interoceptive
>  processing. Interoception is a sense of awareness of one’s own body and
>  its internal states and sensations [21] and encompasses dissociable di­
>  mensions of accuracy, awareness, and sensibility [22]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dab7k7key5g8xahrxf83x3))


> The body awareness (BA) task, rooted in principles of body scanning and
>  somatic practices, explicitly directs attention towards the body, whereas
>  the dance exercise (DE) task, focused on aerobic physical dance move­
>  ment, implicitly boosts the salience of bodily signals. We were interested
>  in determining, in the context of DDD, if it is more effective to explicitly
>  focus on bodily sensations, or to implicitly enhance the salience of
>  bodily signals through dance-based exercise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2daks7h3z74v2a2th4m48ta))


> Finally, the use of two
>  dance tasks, instead of one dance task and a no-intervention control
>  group, allows us to control for the influence of physical exercise [1,39]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dap9v7fygr18cjmpdwqpaj))


> Impor­
>  tantly, self-reported interoceptive awareness, which does not necessarily
>  correlate with interoceptive accuracy [29], has – to our knowledge – not
>  yet been assessed in DDD [30]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dafer6xp5bqdpgeb59bc7c))


> A central feature of DDD is the experience of physiological numbing
>  and a sense of detachment between one’s sense of self and their body
>  [16]. Talking therapies may be less likely to address this fundamental
>  aspect of the disorder. Instead, “… treatment should focus on grounding
>  and orientation to the self and the here and now” [7]; p. 468).” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dahpacgjd98f2bfzpefv6x))
