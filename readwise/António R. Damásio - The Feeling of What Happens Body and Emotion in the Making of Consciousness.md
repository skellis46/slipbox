## Highlights
- Emotions are inseparable from the idea of reward or punishment, of pleasure or pain, of approach or withdrawal, of personal advantage and disadvantage. Inevitably, emotions are inseparable from the idea of good and evil. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpevsectt9wk7etf3x9ctbvj))
- The pervasiveness of emotion in our development and subsequently in our everyday experience connects virtually every object or situation in our experience, by virtue of conditioning, to the fundamental values of homeostatic regulation: reward and punishment; pleasure or pain; approach or withdrawal; personal advantage or disadvantage; and, inevitably, good (in the sense of survival) or evil (in the sense of death). Whether we like it or not, this is the natural human condition. But when consciousness is available, feelings have their maximum impact, and individuals are also able to reflect and to plan. They have a means to control the pervasive tyranny of emotion: it is called reason. Ironically, of course, the engines of reason still require emotion, which means that the controlling power of reason is often modest.

- You make those attributions purely on the basis of the movements of the organism, the speed of each act, the number of acts per unit of time, the style of the movements, and so on. You can do the same thing with a simple chip moving about on a computer screen. Some jagged fast movements will appear "angry," harmonious but explosive jumps will look "joyous," recoiling motions will look "fearful." A video that depicts several geometric shapes moving about at different rates and holding varied relationships reliably elicits attributions of emotional state from normal adults and even children. The reason why you can anthropomorphize the chip or an animal so effectively is simple: emotion, as the word indicates, is about movement, about externalized behavior, about certain orchestrations of reactions to a given cause, within a given environment.

- To the degree that Aplysia can represent its emotive state in the nervous system, it may have the makings of a feeling. We do not know whether Aplysia has feelings or not, but it is extremely difficult to imagine that Aplysia would know of such feelings if it does have them.

- There would have been, however, unmistakable wakefulness: the eyes would have been open; muscle tone, maintained. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpev55xyr66yhmwps62bxh3a))
    - Note: The phrase unmistakable wakefulness really appeals to me. Title?
- Observing an episode of absence automatism you would have watched the elaborate behaviors of an organism deprived of all extended consciousness and of everything but perhaps the dimmest form of core consciousness. One can only try to imagine the remains of a mind from which self and knowing have been removed, perhaps a mind strewn with images of things to be known but never really known, with things not really owned—stripped of the engine for deliberate action.

    - Note: Extraordinary. Drama, play, film script.
- venture that absence of emotion is a reliable correlate of defective core consciousness, perhaps as much as the presence of some degree of continuous emoting is virtually always associated with the conscious state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpevcrra5ysjd6b85wz3fqws))
