## Highlights

> is that *to an audience* there is no difference between misinformation and not-misinformation. The idea of misinformation is a construct we, as third parties, use. But to an audience it’s just information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ng971csvv1zrhxgn2c9xvk))


> If we accept that when I get the correct time I will adjust my behavior towards it (and arrive early) it goes without saying that I will adjust my behavior towards the wrong time if I get that. Because the thing about misinformation from the point of view of an unknowing audience is that the misinformation one accepts as fact is felt as fact. If the killing of Breonna Taylor shifted your attitudes about the police, or racism in the U.S., it would be really weird to believe that false stories about Ashli Babbitt being intentionally targeted and “murdered” at the January 6th attempted coup didn’t shift the beliefs of others. To claim that misinformation has no effect on actions and belief you would have to claim that no **information,** of any sort, has impact on actions and belief. Not the reported cause of death of your father, not 9/11, not the APR of a credit card offer. Not the article someone wrote claiming that misinformation doesn’t change belief. The idea that information doesn’t change beliefs, ever, is ridiculous on its face. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ngb1xfsqgrwmbfhwmptctf))


> In this version of reality, the idea that better information literacy or critical reasoning skills — of us, or the friends that listen to us — could lead to belief change is futile. The facts are merely window-dressing on deeper beliefs that must be addressed directly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ngc5r57yv5hdqq8gb38n53))


+++++ 
- Note: Somatics unlimited: this is a criticism of my position really. Because we are dealing with belief. What would it take to change your position on the value of somatics? Then present that article JB sent me?


> The general retort to this seems to be that while misinformation may have resulted in these specific actions, attacking the misinformation would not have changed the *belief*, which is seen as unmovable by facts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ngfkg8k5rnvgrzkyyyy8ff))


> My issue with the “narrative account” is not its noting of this pattern, a pattern that has been noted since the beginning of recorded history. Rather it’s the unidirectional nature of the account. The “naive” account ran causality from information to belief. The “narrative” account runs it from belief to information.

> But here’s a question — if you have a belief already, why spend all this time collecting evidence and in many cases sharing it? People spend a lot of time doing this, and people generally invest their time in things that have value to them. When we ask those advancing the second account, the “narrative” account, they’ll reference things outside of the logical — people share to self-express, people read things for reasons of self-identity. But this too is a bit odd. There’s many different ways to express yourself, or connect with your self-identity, and a lot of them are quite low effort. If all this sharing of facts has nothing to do with logic, then why are you collecting *facts*? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2nghmfx6b7ek1axa6sz4esq))


> What I’d propose (and I have borrowed from a mishmash of sources here, from Leo Festinger to Matthew McKeon) is that people spend all this time because they want their beliefs to seem *reasonable*. And while that it connected to identity, it is connected in a way that straddles the worlds of logic and self-conception.

> Rather, it was to convince me that her position was reasonable, and that she had come to it by reasonable means ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2ngk0sxdfr4v6v26nq1wzcp))


> To review — yes, we come to beliefs before evidence, but we wish not only to express our beliefs but to be thought as reasonable. In some cases, we adopt beliefs considered reasonable by those around us. Sometimes we adopt those beliefs just to seem reasonable. When we adopt beliefs thought by some to be unreasonable, **we supply reasons**, often in the form of evidence. But far from being an afterthought, the evidence we supply is a necessary price we pay for the maintenance of our beliefs. If the reasonableness of a belief becomes too expensive or difficult to maintain, we lose the belief. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2nhm8praecfqnnednaxy128))


> This model hopefully cuts a middle road between the mode one (facts form beliefs) and mode two (facts are merely window-dressing on beliefs). People do select facts based on pre-existing beliefs quite often, but that does not mean that the facts are irrelevant. On the contrary, since a sense of reasonableness is required for belief maintenance the facts and evidence *matter quite a bit*, and people confronted with counter-evidence or a lack of supporting facts may find their beliefs difficult to maintain socially, and ultimately personally.
