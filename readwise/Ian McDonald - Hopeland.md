## Highlights

> faery misdirection. Come get ur fon, come get mugged. (Location 288)


> DOROTHY GODIN arrives at the group. DOROTHY: Orthopraxy, not orthodoxy. LINDNER: I beg your pardon? DOROTHY: Conformity of practice, not belief. Enforced belief is no belief. It’s obvious.

> Auberon Brightbourne strode onto the dance-floor. No hesitant, testing steps here. He must throw himself in. He swallowed the four-on-the-floor and the heat, the spinning lights, the intimidation of other skin in his personal space. He danced as late-sixties Irish nano-gentry must: flailing and awkward but without self-consciousness or irony. Irony is the murderer of honesty. Those men who could see him nodded, smiled and gave him space to spin on. (Location 3119)


> nauseous with exertion. Waves break high over the seawall (Location 5281)


> Orthopraxy, not orthodoxy. ‘Means?’ ‘What you do, not what you believe.’ (Location 7178)

> Humanity’s greatest talent is its ability to make shit up as it goes along. (Location 7669)


> l’esprit de l’avion. (Location 7674)


> The great things can go unfinished because they can never be finished. (Location 7945)
