## Highlights

> The Brain—is wider than the Sky— For—put them side by side— The one the other will contain With ease—and You—beside—               Emily Dickinson (Location 32)


> It’s an act of transformation, a kind of magic: anaesthesia is the art of turning people into objects. (Location 74)


> I have a childhood memory of looking in the bathroom mirror, and for the first time realising that my experience at that precise moment – the experience of being me – would at some point come to an end, and that ‘I’ would die. (Location 85)

> Whether you’re a scientist or not, consciousness is a mystery that matters. For each of us, our conscious experience is all there is. Without it there is nothing at all: no world, no self, no interior and no exterior. (Location 100)


> Without consciousness, it may hardly matter whether you live for another five years or 4another five hundred. In all that time there would be nothing it would be like to be you. (Location 108)


> At each stage in this process you exist, but the notion that there is a single unique conscious self (a soul?) that persists over time may be grossly mistaken. Indeed, one of the most compelling aspects of the mystery of consciousness is the nature of self. Is consciousness possible without self-consciousness, and if so would it still matter so much? (Location 116)


> For me, these questions evoke the uncanny sympathy I felt when watching Dave Bowman destroy 5HAL’s personality in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, by the simple act of removing its memory banks, one by one. (Location 123)


> hope to show you is that by accounting for properties of consciousness, in terms of mechanisms in brains and bodies, the deep metaphysical whys and hows of consciousness become, little by little, less mysterious. (Location 141)


> I use the word ‘wetware’ to underline that brains are not computers made of meat. They are chemical machines as much as they are electrical networks. Every brain that has ever existed has been part of a living body, embedded in and interacting with its environment – an environment which in many cases contains other embodied brains. Explaining the properties of consciousness in terms of biophysical mechanisms requires understanding brains – and conscious minds – as embodied and embedded systems. (Location 143)


> In my view, consciousness has more to do with being alive than with being intelligent. We are conscious selves precisely because we are beast machines. I will make the case that experiences of being you, or of being me, emerge from the way the brain predicts and controls the internal state of the body. The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul. It is a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all 7our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body. (Location 150)


> By the end of the book, you’ll understand that our conscious experiences of the world and the self are forms of brain-based prediction – ‘controlled hallucinations’ – that arise with, through, and because of our living bodies. (Location 160)


> Our conscious experiences are part of nature just as our bodies are, just as our world is. And when life ends, consciousness will end too. (Location 173)


> The novelist Julian Barnes, in his meditation on mortality, puts it perfectly. When the end of consciousness comes there is nothing – really nothing – to be frightened of. (Location 175)


> This way of putting things is most closely associated with the philosopher Thomas Nagel, who in 1974 published a now legendary article called ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ in which he argued that while we humans could never experience the experiences of a bat, there nonetheless would be something it is like for the bat, to be a bat.* I’ve always favoured Nagel’s approach because it emphasises phenomenology: the subjective properties of conscious experience, such as why a visual experience has the form, structure, and qualities that it does, as compared to the subjective properties of an emotional experience, or of an olfactory experience. These properties are sometimes also called qualia in philosophy: 12the redness of red, the pang of jealousy, the sharp pain or dull throb of a toothache. (Location 191)


> Wherever there is experience, there is phenomenology; and wherever there is phenomenology, there is consciousness. (Location 199)


> The definition of consciousness as ‘any kind of subjective experience whatsoever’ is admittedly simple and may even sound trivial, but this is a good thing. When a complex phenomenon is incompletely understood, prematurely precise definitions can be constraining and even misleading. (Location 228)


> (A ‘mechanism’ – to be clear – can be defined as a system of causally interacting parts that produce effects.) (Location 252)

> ‘[E]ven when we 16have explained the performance of all the functions in the vicinity of experience – perceptual discrimination, categorization, internal access, verbal report – there may still remain a further unanswered question: Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?’ (Location 254)

> My preferred philosophical position, and the default assumption of many neuroscientists, is physicalism. This is the idea that the universe is made of physical stuff, and that conscious states are either identical to, or somehow emerge from, particular arrangements of this physical stuff. Some philosophers use the term materialism instead of physicalism, but for our purposes they can be treated synonymously. (Location 261)


> Nowadays few philosophers or scientists would explicitly sign up for this view. But for many people, at least in the West, dualism remains beguiling. The seductive intuition that 17conscious experiences seem non-physical encourages a ‘naïve dualism’ where this ‘seeming’ drives beliefs about how things actually are. (Location 268)


> Taking functionalism at face value, as many do, carries the striking implication that consciousness is something that can be 18simulated on a computer. Remember that for functionalists, consciousness depends only on what a system does, not on what it is made of. This means that if you get the functional relations right – if you ensure that a system has the right kind of ‘input–output mappings’ – then this will be enough to give rise to consciousness. In other words, for functionalists, simulation means instantiation – it means coming into being, in reality. (Location 284)


> the main problems with panpsychism don’t lie with its apparent craziness – after all, some crazy ideas turn out to be true, or at least useful. The main problems are that it doesn’t really explain anything and that it doesn’t lead to testable hypotheses. It’s an 19easy get-out to the apparent mystery posed by the hard problem, and taking it on ushers the science of consciousness down an empirical dead end. (Location 298)


> Here’s why the zombie idea is supposed to provide an argument against physicalist explanations of consciousness. If you can imagine a zombie, this means you can conceive of a world that is indistinguishable from our world, but in which no consciousness is happening. And if you can conceive of such a world, then consciousness cannot be a physical phenomenon. (Location 330)


> According to the real problem, the primary goals of consciousness science are to explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience. This means explaining why a particular conscious experience is the way it is – why it has the phenomenological properties that it has – in terms of physical mechanisms and processes in the brain and body. These explanations should enable us to predict when specific subjective 23experiences will occur, and enable their control through intervening in the underlying mechanisms. In short, addressing the real problem requires explaining why a particular pattern of brain activity – or other physical process – maps to a particular kind of conscious experience, not merely establishing that it does.
