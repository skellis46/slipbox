## Highlights
- Indeed, it is not uncommon to encounter explicit calls for a post-human future, one in which the human condition is radically altered or altogether transcended. At the same time, however, others warn of the possibility that we might descend from rather than transcend the human condition. The usual agent of change in each case, enabling either the utopian ascent or the infernal descent of humankind, is “technology.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph6a046m4j12586bwhyd8r8))
- I want to focus on one seemingly neglected human capacity, which may not exclusively define the human but which certainly characterizes it: the capacity for wonder. Particularly, I want to focus on two questions: How has our technological milieu affected our capacity to experience wonder? And how, in turn, has this affected how we think about the human condition? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph6a9eqe295frd3m0ajkgb4))
- Taking this possibility as my point of departure, I propose that our technological milieu has generated an environment that is inhospitable to the experience of wonder, an experience foundational to the pursuit of the highest human aspirations.

- Wonder is what happens when we unexpectedly apprehend the marvellous quality of the ordinary. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphdkhgssadegpxcz8fp7kw0))
- Wonder shares certain characteristics with awe or the experience of the sublime, but it does not necessarily have the sliver of terror these words imply. Wonder is experienced as an interruption of our ordinary expectations or usual way of seeing the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphdsmz1kccm6ynrq47h44g1))
- As G.K. Chesterton once put it, “Gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphdtdcxw5ct0gk2b6dhwv8z))
- Or perhaps it would be better to say that wonder is what happens when we unexpectedly apprehend the marvellous quality of the ordinary or when the previously unperceived depths of reality reveal themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphdtz4xzj1mjbhdxdnfr561))
- I do not want to suggest that it is impossible to experience wonder today. To borrow Walker Percy’s felicitous phrasing, we may experience it, despite ourselves, by some “dim dazzling trick of grace.” But it seems to be clear that digital culture can inhibit rather than encourage the experience. How? First, by oversaturating our experience with digitally generated visual stimuli. Second, by dimming our perception of both the world and our neighbour. Third, by eliminating the contexts within which an experience of wonder might be more likely to occur. As we will see, these three are closely related and, in certain particulars, overlapping.

- This is all to say that any claim about how digital imagery has saturated our experience should acknowledge a historical trajectory that dates back to at least the late nineteenth century, when there were public debates about what we might call visual pollution or the colonization of public spaces by all manner of printed images, mostly in the service of advertisement.

- In this way, the proliferation of digital imagery swamps our sensory apparatus, which is increasingly desensitized to visual experience. Or perhaps it is better to say that the multitudinous cacophony of images we casually scroll through day after day trains us to be merely passive consumers of visual stimuli, disinclined to attend to the world with the care that may ordinarily be the condition of wonder.

- Writing in the early days of manned space exploration, Hannah Arendt noted that recent progress in science, once translated into everyday life, “has brought with it a veritable avalanche of fabulous instruments and ever more ingenious machinery,” which might evoke a certain kind of amazement, but an amazement ultimately at our own ingenuity. “All of this makes it more unlikely every day,” Arendt warned, “that man will encounter anything in the world around him that is not man-made and hence is not, in the last analysis, he himself in a different disguise.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphe7ye5bsh0qgspse25fvad))
- Or, as the playwright Max Frisch once quipped, technology is “the knack of so arranging the world that we don’t have to experience it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphe9zkffgbyea2mbx9kh9xg))
- One additional consequence of being inundated by visual stimuli on our devices (but also on the countless screens that surround us and on older analog surfaces as well) is that our perception of the non-human world—hues of the sinking sun, birdsong, glimmering fresh-fallen dew, a falling star—is obfuscated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gphec159jcy1vz6psc4vzj88))
- Even our encounters with those we love are often at the remove occasioned by a documenting device. We miss in these cases the opportunity to register the uniqueness of the human being before us, to recognize that there is no other creature in the universe quite like our neighbour. And, because so much of our self-understanding is the gift of the other, we may even miss how miraculous it is that we, in turn, exist. In the absence of such wonder, we may be, as Heschel feared, in danger of forfeiting our humanity, and that of our neighbour, simply by failing to notice it.

- The philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch once observed that “it is in the capacity to love, that is to see, that the liberation of the soul from fantasy consists.” She defines fantasy as “the proliferation of blinding self-centered aims and images.” Fantasy in this sense generates a “system of energy” that shapes our decisions and directs our will. In her view, “what counteracts the system is attention to reality inspired by, consisting of, love.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpheen3jvjym0cshxhkqec4x))
