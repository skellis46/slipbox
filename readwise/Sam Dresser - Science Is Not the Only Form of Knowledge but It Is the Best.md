## Highlights

> In argumentation studies, definitions that are intended to transfer emotive force, such as feelings of approval or disapproval, are known as persuasive definitions. To say that scientism just is ‘putting too high a value on science’ is akin to saying that abortion is murder – the definition is overloaded with emotional force. Just as pro-choice advocates would object to saying that abortion is murder, since it expresses disapproval of abortion, advocates of scientism would object to saying that scientism is ‘putting too high a value on science’ since it expresses disapproval of scientism. Instead of condemning scientism by definition, as Sorell and Haack do, opponents of scientism need to *show* precisely what is wrong with it.

> In their introduction to the [anthology](https://academic.oup.com/book/3743) *Scientism: Prospects and Problems* (2018), René van Woudenberg, Rik Peels and Jeroen de Ridder agree that scientism should not be weaponised when they write: ‘no one will accept this notion of “scientism” as an adequate characterisation of their own views, as no one will think that their deference to science is *exaggerated*, or their readiness to accept claims made by the sciences is *excessive*.’ In fact, in the [paper](https://www.pdcnet.org/logos-episteme/content/logos-episteme_2012_0003_0001_0075_0095) ‘Six Signs of Scientism’ (2012), Haack herself observes that, before it was weaponised by those who sought to defend religion and philosophy from science trespassing on their territories, ‘the word “scientism” was neutral.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2n9fxq7dxjy3g6v9mpgrz30))

- Note: Somatics unlimited: none of us will think we are the problem because we don't imagine we are making these kinds of claims.


> Scientific knowledge is quantitatively better than non-scientific knowledge because scientific disciplines produce *more* knowledge, and the knowledge they produce has *more* impact than the knowledge produced by non-scientific disciplines. This claim is supported by data on the research output (that is, number of publications) and research impact (that is, number of citations) of scientific and non-scientific academic disciplines. These data show that scientific disciplines produce more publications, and those publications get cited more than the publications of non-scientific disciplines.

- Note: Hilarious. Although number of citations is intriguing. Evidence of cellular nature of the journal


> While most scientific publications are cited, only 16 per cent of publications in the humanities are cited. Within the humanities, philosophy, ethics and religion have the highest percentages of uncited publications. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2n9pnd7vwwqy4b5nf3nz18d))
