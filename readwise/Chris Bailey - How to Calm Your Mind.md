## Highlights
- When something is scarce, our brain perceives it as valuable. When it’s abundant, our brain expects it and calibrates back to our previous baseline level of happiness, a phenomenon called *hedonic adaptation*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9m49x5kw62km7t010tqpbt))

- I began to appreciate how the fast led me to have more of the ingredients I’ve mentioned: time, patience, productivity, meaning, perspective, calm, and depth. I also had more memories available to me, because of how I could process what happened in front of me in each moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9ma7rf9h3j2kvxp0ehmfbw))
- the streams of stress flowing into our life far outnumber those flowing out. We have more email and less play; more social media and fewer hobbies; more “friends” and fewer deep connections. We spend more time watching the news than we do moving through nature; more time sitting and less time seeing into the eyes of our friends, family, and acquaintances.

- More recent data from the pandemic shows that our screen time has spiked to around *thirteen hours a day*—though it’s tough to tell whether this rise is temporary or an early sign of an increasingly digital future. Note that these figures account only for the time we spend *looking* at screens; they don’t include the time we are otherwise connected to the digital world, like when we’re listening to a podcast or an audiobook.

- The analog world is where we have historically lived; where we socialize with others, create things with our hands, enjoy the wonders of nature, and otherwise settle down and recharge. Calm lives in the analog world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9n5z1x3zxm4mvmw3stshxj))
- the digital world is valuable only so far as it supports us in what we intend to accomplish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9na5168dp7k9q9z40wfkx9))
- In addition to making us more calm and balanced, the analog world has yet another benefit as it relates to making time more memorable: it slows down our *perception* of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9ntteyy4mt7mjnm3t7wymv))
- On the other hand, the analog world is slow, in a way that is good and meaningful. It’s slow enough to process, slow enough to savor, slow enough to remember. Given we spend a ridiculous proportion of our day in front of screens, purposefully stepping back from the digital world to engage with the analog world can be considered a surefire path to calm.

- As McGonigal said to me, “So many of people’s negative experiences with movement come from the way fitness and exercise are often framed as ways to make your body more acceptable.” Move because moving feels good—and because you’ll feel amazing after.

- The bottom line: however you can, however feels good to you, move. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9pd23r8rkystarykk61t0y))
- If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

- The most bountiful wellspring of calm in the analog world is easily human connection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpapgv9tyde0w91119et7x6g))
- While anxiety is an emotion that tends to draw us inward, when we turn outward and toward other people, we feel energized, relaxed, while full of life. As Stanford professor Jamil Zaki wrote in *The Atlantic*, “people are psychologically intertwined, such that helping others is a kindness to ourselves” in the same way that “watching over ourselves supports others.” He recommends the strategy of having an “other-care” day instead of a *self*-care day—an approach worth trying out if you’re looking to experiment with methods of connection.

- Two surefire ways of stimulating this nerve are yawning and slow breathing. Slow breathing works especially well when we breathe from our belly and exhale for longer than we inhale.
  Another non-breath way to stimulate the vagus nerve is to soften your gaze so that your eyes aren’t focused on anything in particular. If you find it tough to wrap your head around this idea, think about how your eyes soften and relax when taking in a sweeping panorama—when looking out at the ocean, the stars, or at a sunset.
