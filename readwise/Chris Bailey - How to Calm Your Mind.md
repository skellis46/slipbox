## Highlights
- When something is scarce, our brain perceives it as valuable. When it’s abundant, our brain expects it and calibrates back to our previous baseline level of happiness, a phenomenon called *hedonic adaptation*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9m49x5kw62km7t010tqpbt))
- scarcity effect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9m67em7xxq384zg8da4zp6))
- I began to appreciate how the fast led me to have more of the ingredients I’ve mentioned: time, patience, productivity, meaning, perspective, calm, and depth. I also had more memories available to me, because of how I could process what happened in front of me in each moment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9ma7rf9h3j2kvxp0ehmfbw))
- the streams of stress flowing into our life far outnumber those flowing out. We have more email and less play; more social media and fewer hobbies; more “friends” and fewer deep connections. We spend more time watching the news than we do moving through nature; more time sitting and less time seeing into the eyes of our friends, family, and acquaintances. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9mzkkb8a1725wzsjnvhw3d))
- More recent data from the pandemic shows that our screen time has spiked to around *thirteen hours a day*—though it’s tough to tell whether this rise is temporary or an early sign of an increasingly digital future. Note that these figures account only for the time we spend *looking* at screens; they don’t include the time we are otherwise connected to the digital world, like when we’re listening to a podcast or an audiobook. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9n451ab29dh1zhcx7b25e4))
- The analog world is where we have historically lived; where we socialize with others, create things with our hands, enjoy the wonders of nature, and otherwise settle down and recharge. Calm lives in the analog world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9n5z1x3zxm4mvmw3stshxj))
- the digital world is valuable only so far as it supports us in what we intend to accomplish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9na5168dp7k9q9z40wfkx9))
- In addition to making us more calm and balanced, the analog world has yet another benefit as it relates to making time more memorable: it slows down our *perception* of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9ntteyy4mt7mjnm3t7wymv))
- On the other hand, the analog world is slow, in a way that is good and meaningful. It’s slow enough to process, slow enough to savor, slow enough to remember. Given we spend a ridiculous proportion of our day in front of screens, purposefully stepping back from the digital world to engage with the analog world can be considered a surefire path to calm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9nw6sq7q7n9mwj1wm8gr2w))
- As McGonigal said to me, “So many of people’s negative experiences with movement come from the way fitness and exercise are often framed as ways to make your body more acceptable.” Move because moving feels good—and because you’ll feel amazing after. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9pbfwkj38v3fa0vmegwdbk))
- The bottom line: however you can, however feels good to you, move. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gp9pd23r8rkystarykk61t0y))
- If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

- The most bountiful wellspring of calm in the analog world is easily human connection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpapgv9tyde0w91119et7x6g))
- While anxiety is an emotion that tends to draw us inward, when we turn outward and toward other people, we feel energized, relaxed, while full of life. As Stanford professor Jamil Zaki wrote in *The Atlantic*, “people are psychologically intertwined, such that helping others is a kindness to ourselves” in the same way that “watching over ourselves supports others.” He recommends the strategy of having an “other-care” day instead of a *self*-care day—an approach worth trying out if you’re looking to experiment with methods of connection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpapmj1p9pt59h2wkfp269ja))
- Two surefire ways of stimulating this nerve are yawning and slow breathing. Slow breathing works especially well when we breathe from our belly and exhale for longer than we inhale.
  Another non-breath way to stimulate the vagus nerve is to soften your gaze so that your eyes aren’t focused on anything in particular. If you find it tough to wrap your head around this idea, think about how your eyes soften and relax when taking in a sweeping panorama—when looking out at the ocean, the stars, or at a sunset.

- Contrary to common belief, burnout is not just exhaustion. Burnout does leave us feeling exhausted—as well as fatigued, depleted, and worn out. But we also need to feel two other things: *cynical* and *unproductive*. To be fully burnt out, we need all three. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc7zvfxth4wsm3e1fs0d54q))
- According to Maslach’s research, six areas of our work act as Petri dishes where chronic stress can incubate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc82tny7ycfrr0b79kqdxwq))
- The first factor of the six is our **workload**—how sustainable the amount of work on our plate is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc830cas8k9hg24fkx28v9q))
- The second source of burnout is a lack of **control**. This factor is rooted in several issues, including how much autonomy we have, whether we have the resources to deliver work that we’re proud of, and whether we have the freedom to shape the projects we’re working on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc83a1bn2m7nbsv2a4jnm19))
- Third, **insufficient reward** dramatically increases our probability of burnout. While we tend to think about money when we think about the rewards of work, money is far from the only currency we derive from our job. Job rewards can be financial (money, bonuses, and stock options), but they can also be social (recognition for the contributions we make), and intrinsic (finding work rewarding in and of itself). The less equitably we’re rewarded, the more ineffective we feel—which contributes to the inefficacy dimension that is a core component of burnout. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc83nshewhx8r42v14g9vvw))
- The fourth burnout factor is **community**, which is about the quality of your relationships and interactions at work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc83vcpkph9k2agdd2eczt9))
- **Fairness** is the fifth factor. Maslach defines fairness as “the extent to which decisions at work are perceived as being just and people are being treated with respect.” A fair workplace promotes employees in an equitable and understandable way, and treats employees with support and respect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8464m9x71s95d1796r1z1))
- The sixth and final burnout factor stems from conflict with our **values**. Essentially, values are what let us connect with our work on a deeper level. When our work connects with what we value, we feel as though we can manifest our values through action, which makes work feel more meaningful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc84v7dd6rtjdfkv1ffxcah))
- To start:
  • Rank, out of ten, how much stress you face from each dimension: workload, control, reward, community, fairness, and values.
  • Identify which of the structural problems you’re facing in the six areas are fixable—and which ones indicate a toxic work environment that you need to get the heck out of.
  • If you still face quite a bit of chronic stress overall, reflect on how strong a fit your job is for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc85fjkqnpxzgvy96bj0s0g))
- One helpful tactic for this is to list all of the activities you do in your work over a month and pick the three that allow you to contribute the most to your team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc86p6fqnpt6k0f0pyyb1mv))
- Consider scheduling a recurring event in your calendar to check up on how well you’re doing on each of the burnout factors—after going through burnout, I’ve scheduled a recurring meeting with myself for every six months. Use any time you feel negative, exhausted, or unproductive as a cue to check up sooner. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc878875za81f5z05b9z6jb))
- What do you savor the most? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc88r3dtayd3y382d06c2y1))
- Savoring provides us with a unique opportunity to deliberately disengage from the accomplishment mindset, to set our ambitions aside, and to actually enjoy ourselves for a while. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc89fc825ba2qn67frx6f52))
- **Here’s my challenge for you: make a list of everything you savor.** If you need ideas, look to the quiet moments in your life you used to enjoy a whole lot more ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc89zyxwf9162et8gcb7ww5))
- Research shows that three factors influence the size of the dopamine hit we get:
  1. **Novelty.** How surprising and unexpected something is to us.
  2. **Direct effect.** The extent to which a stimulus tangibly and directly influences our life, or how much it matters to us. This is also referred to as saliency.
  3. **Genetics.** Some of us are simply predisposed to experience higher or lower dopamine levels in some regions of our brain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8bsaqx635zngqgvwp2wyh))
- In many ways, internet porn is the ultimate superstimulus. As Gary Wilson, the author of *Your Brain on Porn* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8cczv91wwcbw7gdepcwrz))
- If you take stock of the activities you engage with throughout the day, and plot them in the following illustration, you’ll see that the most novel and personalized superstimuli live at the top, while your most boring activities live near the bottom. I’ve populated this chart with examples of stimuli I personally tended to throughout the week. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8ftf1hwabew3ywwbmp6t9))
- **The sum of dopamine released by your daily activities determines your overall stimulation height.** In this way, your level of mental stimulation is largely just a function of how much dopamine your mind is accustomed to living with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8est7r1g8p4c2s8q7dfxf))
- ![](https://readwise-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/reader/parsed_document_assets/25223255/ART_06_AltitudeFull.jpg-ART_06_AltitudeFull.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8fypw86e56cgesffa54cm))
- You don’t have to draw a fancy picture if you don’t want to: just make a list of your daily activities and distractions, while minding how novel and salient each one is, to place it relative to the other ones on your list. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8hega39q2jrx7d5x0z9rv))
- In sorting your daily activities by their height of dopamine release, and perhaps after a bit of experimentation, you may notice some of the same things that I did, including that: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8j4efr7bqecbjdq34rsjv))
- Not all heights of stimulation are created equal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8j7q83e9x3gwgqdt5m5b8))
- The higher you rise, the less you’ll want to come down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8jfw468c8vje78swjfn6z))
- Your height of stimulation has probably risen over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8jm3jwkb7b8tfmxnrpxr8))
- The items on your chart are not static. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8jry0z8rx1qnwdf0gzyqs))
- Analog activities live near the bottom; digital activities live at the top. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8jx35gd1atgev9f2d2ecw))
- What stimulates you does not necessarily make you happy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8k0yvw4dw1wnk64p7rqx1))
- Some stimuli were related to work, others were personal. Some were digital, others were analog. It didn’t matter: identifying as many dopaminergic, stimulating things as I could, I laid out the ground rules to follow, and did my best to anticipate obstacles ahead of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8pn2y27r1cp7b4gee9m67))
- As the experiment went on, I also found it helpful to create a few other rules to live and work by:
  • If I wanted to watch TV, a movie, or something on a streaming site, I had to decide twenty-four hours ahead of time that I’d do so, to not give in to impulse.
  • If I wanted to send someone a message—whether over email or over text—I’d add the message to a text file on my computer, which was full of drafts of texts, emails, and instant messages to send off the next time I allowed myself to connect. This let me choose to engage with people—they couldn’t interrupt me at random intervals throughout the day.
  • If I bought something online, I had to know what I wanted before visiting the website, so I couldn’t do any online “window-shopping.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8q50sfknkzfwnrds5heks))
- Here’s the thing to keep in mind: **any activity that leads you to enjoy the present moment will lead you to experience greater calm.** This, as a result, will make you more engaged, productive, and satisfied. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc8qr92hcwcnra1z8q0tv63))
- These are the kinds of stories we tell ourselves about our productivity. On some level, we still equate output and energy expenditure with productivity—even when the connection between output, effort, and productivity has become severed with knowledge work.
  Most of us don’t give much thought to measuring how productive we are. But given how much of our lives we spend working—or just trying to do what we set out to do, without getting in our own way—this is a worthwhile question to think about: **How should we be measuring our productivity?** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc2j9m5p8qt1s46w81wr3n0))
- Try moving more, in nature if you can. Practice meditation, a way of developing a more vibrant presence with everything you do. Create a personalized savor list, and enjoy one thing on it every day. Inventory the stress in your life to identify low-hanging sources you can tame. Define productivity hours so you can strike a daily balance between striving and savoring. Undertake a monthlong stimulation fast to make focus effortless and settle your mind. Choose a few “currencies” in your life that you personally want to strive for more of—like happiness, presence, and time with other people—instead of the defaults like money and status. Invest in habits of calm in the analog world that lead your body to release serotonin, oxytocin, and endorphins, along with a healthy and more reasonable amount of dopamine. Notice and question the guilt that arises as you invest in calm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc7f07by92qh3mq0hh86ww9))
