## Highlights

> We offer
>  several interpretations of embodiment, the most inter-
>  esting being the thesis that mental representations in
>  bodily formats (B-formats) have an important role in
>  cognition. Potential B-formats include motoric, somato-
>  sensory, affective and interoceptive formats. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4bc0werym3s9nmf6t4jy1))

> A spectre is haunting the laboratories of cognitive science,
>  the spectre of embodied cognition (EC). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4jz4k4k542s64qyrew5f2))

> Embodiment theorists want to elevate the
>  importance of the body in explaining cognitive activities.
>  What is meant by ‘body’ here? It ought to mean: the whole
>  physical body minus the brain. Letting the brain qualify as
>  part of the body would trivialize the claim that the body is
>  crucial to mental life, simply because the brain is the seat
>  of most, if not all, mental events. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4jdav0perbnffwhwsffwa))

> However, embodiment seems to
>  mean widely different things to different EC theorists, and
>  their views range from the radical to the not so radical. In
>  view of this diversity, it is impossible to canvass all
>  varieties of EC (for review see Ref. [13]). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7a4n72vd2yywmy04tqk78n8))
