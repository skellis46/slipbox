> By using less accurate components, it is possible to design robots in which properties of the physical device (e.g., mechanical and electrical losses) act so as to damp down responses and hence avoid undesirable variations and fluctuations. As a result, Smithers suggests, it may even be misleading to think of the sensors as measuring devices—rather, we should see them as filters whose role is, in part, to soak up behaviorally insignificant variations so as to yield systems able to maintain simple and robust interactions with their environment.

> Simulation offers at best an impoverished version of the real-world arena, and a version impoverished in some dangerous ways: ways that threaten to distort our image of the operation of the agents by obscuring the contributions of environmental features and of real physical bodies.

> And the role of the brain, in any case, is merely to get the body to go through the right motions. Adaptive success finally accrues not to brains but to brain-body coalitions embedded in ecologically realistic environments. (Location 1401)

> The pure Dynamical Systems theorist is thus seeking mathematical or geometrical models that give a powerful purchase on the observable phenomena. This is good science, and it is explanatory science (not mere description). (Location 1749)

> Minds may be essentially embodied and embedded and still depend crucially on brains which compute and represent. To make this ecumenical position stick, however, we need to specifically address some direct challenges concerning the very ideas of computation and representation (do they have nontrivial definitions compatible with new framework?) and some problems concerning the practical application of such notions in systems exhibiting emergent properties dependent upon processes of complex, continuous, reciprocal causation. (Location 2109)


> The thesis of Radical Embodied Cognition is thus, it seems, a genuinely held view.8 It involves a rejection of explanations that invoke internal representations, a rejection of computational explanation in psychology, and a suggestion that we would be better off abandoning these old tools in favor of the shining new implements of Dynamical Systems theory. (Location 2202)


> Heidegger (1927) wrote of the importance of Dasein (being there)—a mode of being-in-the-world in which we are not detached, passive observers but active participants—and stressed the way our practical dealings with the world (hammering nails, opening doors, and so on) do not involve detached representings (e.g. of the hammer as a rigid object of a certain weight and shape) so much as functional couplings. We use the hammer to drive in the nail, and it is this kind of skilled practical engagement with the world that is, for Heidegger, at the heart of all thought and intentionality.33 A key notion in this analysis is the idea of equipment— the stuff that surrounds us and figures in the multiple skilled activities underlying our everyday abilities to cope and succeed. (Location 2590)


> Closer in spirit and execution to the present project is the work of the phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty,35 who was concerned to depict everyday intelligent activity as the playing out of whole organism-bodyworld synergies. In particular, Merleau-Ponty stressed the importance of what I have called "continuous reciprocal causation"—viz., the idea that we must go beyond the passive image of the organism perceiving the world and recognize the way our actions may be continuously responsive to worldly events which are at the same time being continuously responsive to our actions. (Location 2601)


> Finally, the recent discussion of "the embodied mind" offered by Varela et al. (1991) displays three central concerns that likewise occupy center stage in the present treatment.38 First, Varela et al. are concerned to do justice to the active nature of perception and the way our cognitive organization reflects our physical involvement in the world. Second, they offer some powerful example of emergent behavior in simple systems.39 Third, there is sustained attention to the notion of reciprocal (or "circular") causation and its negative implications for certain kinds of componentbased reductive projects. (Location 2624)


> Varela et al. are thus pursuing a closely related project to our own. There are, however, some important differences of emphasis and interest. First, Varela et al. use their reflections as evidence against realist and objectivist views of the world. I deliberately avoid this extension, which runs the risk of obscuring the scientific value of an embodied, embedded approach by linking it to the problematic idea than objects are not independent of mind.41 (Location 2631)


> Second, Varela et al. (ibid., p. 9) oppose the idea that "cognition is fundamentally representation." Our approach is much more sympathetic to representationalist and information-processing analyses. (Location 2638)


> We live in a world where speech is an institution. —Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception (1945/1962), p. 184 (Location 2678)


> that the basic form of individual reason (fast pattern completion in multiple neural systems) is common throughout nature, and that where we human beings really score is in our amazing capacities to create and maintain a variety of special external structures (symbolic and social-institutional). These external structures function so as to complement our individual cognitive profiles and to diffuse human reason across wider and wider social and physical networks whose collective computations exhibit their own special dynamics and properties. (Location 2686)


> Human brains, if this is anywhere near the mark, are not so different from the fragmented, special-purpose, action-oriented organs of other animals and autonomous robots. But we excel in one crucial respect: we are masters at structuring our physical and social worlds so as to press complex coherent behaviors from these unruly resources. We use intelligence to structure our environment so that we can succeed with less intelligence. Our brains make the world smart so that we can be dumb in peace! Or, to look at it another way, it is the human brain plus these chunks of external scaffolding that finally constitutes the smart, rational inference engine we call mind. (Location 2697)


> Taken as a theory of the psychological mechanisms of daily individual choice, the substantive rationality model is, however, deeply flawed. The main trouble, as Herbert Simon (1982) famously pointed out, is that human brains are, at best, loci of only partial or bounded4 rationality. Our brains, as the preceding chapters repeatedly attest, were not designed as instruments of unhurried, fully informed reason. They were not designed to yield perfect responses on the assumption of perfect information. (Location 2709)


> Organizations, factories, offices, institutions, and such are the large-scale scaffolds of our distinctive cognitive success. But as surely as these larger wholes inform and scaffold individual thought, they themselves are structured and informed by the communicative acts of individuals and by episodes of solitary problem solving. One crucial project for the cognitive sciences of the embodied mind is to begin the hard task of understanding and analyzing this complex reciprocal relationship—a daunting task that will require the use of simulations which operate at multiple time scales and levels of organization. (Location 2807)


> All of this, as Hutchins (1995) pointedly notes, serves only to remind us of what we already knew: if our achievements exceed those of our forebears, it isn't because our brains are any smarter than theirs. Rather, our brains are the cogs in larger social and cultural machines—machines that bear the mark of vast bodies of previous search and effort, both individual and collective. This machinery is, quite literally, the persisting embodiment of the wealth of achieved knowledge. It is this leviathan of diffused reason that presses maximal benefits from our own simple efforts and is thus the primary vehicle of our distinctive cognitive success. (Location 2891)


> However, the emphasis on language as a medium of communication tends to blind us to a subtler but equally potent role: the role of language as a tool1 that alters the nature of the computational tasks involved in various kinds of problem solving. (Location 2899)


> Carruthers (ibid., p. 56) suggests that "one does not first entertain a private thought and then write it down: rather, the thinking is the writing." (Location 2963)


> Strikingly, Dennett (1995, pp. 370-373) suggests that it is this subtle reprogramming of the brain by (primarily) linguistic bombardment that yields the phenomena of human consciousness (our sense of self) and enables us to far surpass the behavioral and cognitive achievements of most other animals. Dennett thus depicts our advanced cognitive skills as attributable in large part not to our innate hardware (which may differ only in small, though important, ways from that of other animals) but to the special way that various plastic (programmable) features of the brain are modified by the effects of culture and language.

> These resources enable us to pursue manipulations and juxtapositions of ideas and data that would quickly baffle the un-augmented brain.10 In all these cases, the real physical environment of printed words and symbols allows us to search, store, sequence, and reorganize data in ways alien to the onboard repertoire of the biological brain.11 (Location 3138)


> It is easy to see, in broad outline, how this might come about. As soon as we formulate a thought in words (or on paper), it becomes an object for ourselves and for others. As an object, it is the kind of thing we can have thoughts about. In creating the object, we need have no thoughts about thoughts—but once it is there, the opportunity immediately exists to attend to it as an object in its own right. The process of linguistic formulation thus creates the stable structure to which subsequent thinkings attach. (Location 3171)


> It is thus only when the relationship between user and artifact is about as close and intimate as that between the spider and the web27 that the bounds of the self—and not just those of computation and broadly cognitive process—threaten to push out into the world. (Location 3318)


> Ours are not the brains of disembodied spirits conveniently glued into ambulant, corporeal shells of flesh and blood. Rather, they are essentially the brains of embodied agents capable of creating and exploiting structure in the world. Conceived as controllers of embodied action, brains will sometimes devote considerable energy not to the direct, one-stop solution of a problem, but to the control and exploitation of environmental structures. Such structures, molded by an iterated sequence of brain-world interactions, can alter and transform the original problem until it takes a form that can be managed with the limited resources of pattern-completing, neuralnetwork-style cognition. (Location 3351)


> In light of all this, it may for some purposes be wise to consider the intelligent system as a spatio-temporally extended process not limited by the tenuous envelope of skin and skull.6 Less dramatically, the traditional divisions among perception, cognition, and action7 look increasingly unhelpful. With the demise of the central executive, perception and cognition look harder to distinguish in the brain. And the division between thought and action fragments once we recognize that real-world actions often play precisely the kinds of functional roles more usually associated with internal processes of cognition and computation. (Location 3368)


> John's "concepts" do not correspond to anything especially unified, as far as I am concerned. And why should they? The situation is rather like that of a person who can build a boat. To speak of the ability to build a boat is to use a simple phrase to ascribe a panoply of skills whose cognitive and physical underpinnings vary greatly. The unity exists only insofar as that particular grab bag of cognitive and physical skills has special significance for a community of seafaring agents. John's "concepts," it seems to me, are just like that: names for complexes of skills whose unity rests not on facts about me but on facts about John's way of life. (Location 3444)


> The sad fact, then, is that almost nothing about me is the way John imagines it to be. We remain strangers despite our intimacy (or perhaps because of it). John's language, introspections, and oversimplistic physicalism incline him to identify my organization too closely with his own limited perspective. He is thus blind to my fragmentary, opportunistic, and generally alien nature. He forgets that I am in large part a survivaloriented device that greatly predates the emergence of linguistic abilities, and that my role in promoting conscious and linguaform cognition is just a recent sideline.
