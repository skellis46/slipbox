> By using less accurate components, it is possible to design robots in which properties of the physical device (e.g., mechanical and electrical losses) act so as to damp down responses and hence avoid undesirable variations and fluctuations. As a result, Smithers suggests, it may even be misleading to think of the sensors as measuring devices—rather, we should see them as filters whose role is, in part, to soak up behaviorally insignificant variations so as to yield systems able to maintain simple and robust interactions with their environment.

> This furthers the deeply misguided vision of the environment as little more than the stage that sets up a certain problem. (Location 1373)


+++++ 
- Note: Shakespeare was wrokng about the stage. Ha.


> Simulation offers at best an impoverished version of the real-world arena, and a version impoverished in some dangerous ways: ways that threaten to distort our image of the operation of the agents by obscuring the contributions of environmental features and of real physical bodies. (Location 1378)


> And the role of the brain, in any case, is merely to get the body to go through the right motions. Adaptive success finally accrues not to brains but to brain-body coalitions embedded in ecologically realistic environments. (Location 1401)
