## Highlights

> The result is what we call the “Jagged Frontier” of AI. Imagine a fortress wall, with some towers and battlements jutting out into the countryside, while others fold back towards the center of the castle. That wall is the capability of AI, and the further from the center, the harder the task. Everything inside the wall can be done by the AI, everything outside is hard for the AI to do. The problem is that the wall is invisible, so some tasks that might logically seem to be the same distance away from the center, and therefore equally difficult – say, writing a sonnet and an exactly 50 word poem – are actually on different sides of the wall. The AI is great at the sonnet, but, because of how it conceptualizes the world in tokens, rather than words, it consistently produces poems of more or less than 50 words.  Similarly, some unexpected tasks ( [like idea generation](https://substack.com/redirect/97d01f5b-d92d-4654-ac6e-94513ea342d2?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) ) are easy for AIs while other tasks that seem to be easy for machines to do (like basic math) are challenges for LLMs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsyfg9zpybymqz71q94v4e))


> [In a different paper than the one we worked on together,](https://substack.com/redirect/d3f20d49-f475-4aa3-9beb-bfbfa220deb6?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) Fabrizio Dell’Acqua shows why relying too much on AI can backfire. In an experiment, he found that recruiters who used high-quality AI became lazy, careless, and less skilled in their own judgment. They missed out on some brilliant applicants and made worse decisions than recruiters who used low-quality AI or no AI at all. When the AI is very good, humans have no reason to work hard and pay attention. They let the AI take over, instead of using it as a tool. He called this “falling asleep at the wheel”, and it can hurt human learning, skill development, and productivity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsxv9kg32sgvxbtz32pjqg))


> In our experiment, we also found that the consultants fell asleep at the wheel – those using AI actually had less accurate answers than those who were not allowed to use AI (but they still did a better job writing up the results than consultants who did not use AI). The authoritativeness of AI can be deceptive if you don’t know where the frontier lies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagsy8y5k7hkxaw57cwdhgb7))


> Centaur work has a clear line between person and machine, like the clear line between the human torso and horse body of the mythical centaur.  Centaurs have a strategic division of labor, switching between AI and human tasks, allocating responsibilities based on the strengths and capabilities of each entity. When I am doing an analysis with the help of AI, I often approach it as a Centaur. I will decide on what statistical techniques to do, but then let the AI handle producing graphs. In our study at BCG, centaurs would do the work they were strongest at themselves, and then hand off tasks inside the jagged frontier to the AI.

> On the other hand, Cyborgs blend machine and person, integrating the two deeply. Cyborgs don't just delegate tasks; they intertwine their efforts with AI, moving back and forth over the jagged frontier. Bits of tasks get handed to the AI, such as initiating a sentence for the AI to complete, so that Cyborgs find themselves working in tandem with the AI. [This is how I suggest approaching using AI for writing](https://substack.com/redirect/d8925f8f-7ce2-404c-a455-19fc8ac5a856?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) , for example. It is also how I generated two of the illustrations in the paper (the Jagged Frontier image and the 54 line graph, both of which were built by ChatGPT, with my initial direction and guidance) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hagt0gpv3740bcjek2kwhd9q))
