## Highlights

> Unsurprisingly, the artistic and ethical shortcomings of AI generators are tied to their dependence on capital and capitalism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyq4bekp0c8vgj3568mvedsa))


> Their functioning seems to be so obscure that David Holz, founder of Midjourney, [stated](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/01/david_holz_midjourney/): “It’s not actually clear what is making the AI models work well […] It’s not clear what parts of the data are actually giving [the model] what abilities”.

> First is the exploitation of cultural capital. These models exploit enormous datasets of images scraped from the web without authors’ consent, and many of those images are original artworks by both dead and living artists. [LAION5](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), an academic research database funded by StabilityAI and used to train its Stable Diffusion model, consists of 5.85 billion image-text pairs. LAION-Aesthetics, a subset of this database, contains a collection of 600 million images algorithmically selected for being “aesthetically pleasing images” — as if aesthetic pleasure were universal.

> The second concern is the propagation of the idea that creativity can be isolated from embodiment, relations, and socio-cultural contexts so as to be statistically modeled. In fact, far from being “creative,” AI-generated images are probabilistic approximations of features of existing artworks. Figuratively speaking, AI image generators create a cartography of a dataset, where features of images and texts (in the form of mathematical abstractions) are distributed at particular locations according to probability calculations. The cartography is called a “manifold” and it contains all the image combinations that are possible with the data at hand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gyq4ehcrsppfp65wvrtt5kah))


> The sampling of features is stochastic, meaning that the samples are randomly selected from the relevant data; this is why a model prompted with the same text will always generate a different result. It is clever, it works well, and you don’t need a PhD to see that such a process has very little to do with any kind of creativity, however you may define it.

> It is the claim to a new form of art by the industry’s public relations engine and the art market that is extremely problematic, especially when it is used to motivate hyperbolic claims of machines’ general intelligence. Such claims exploit culture and art to reinforce what I call an ideology of prediction, a belief that anything can be predicted and, by extension, controlled. Prediction ideology is the operating system of the Global North. Wealthy corporations and individuals are frenetically investing in deep and probabilistic learning research. Given that most of the Global North is structured around algorithmic systems (from welfare, justice, and employment to warfare, finance, and domestic and international policy), implementing deep learning at scale offers a potentially huge financial gain to those running the business.

> AI art is, in my view, soft propaganda for the ideology of prediction. As long as it remains tied to the paradigm and politics of ever-large models, increasing capital and marketing hyperbole, its contribution to art practice will have little meaning, if any.
