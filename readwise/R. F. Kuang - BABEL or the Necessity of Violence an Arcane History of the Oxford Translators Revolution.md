## Highlights

> Language was always the companion of empire, and as such, together they begin, grow, and flourish. And later, together, they fall. ANTONIO DE NEBRIJA, Gramática de la lengua castellana (Location 89)


> They were no strangers to this magic. They had all seen silver-work in effect before; in England it was impossible to avoid.

> ‘Theory comes from the Greek theōria, meaning a sight or spectacle, whose root also gives us the word theatre.’ (Location 3481)


> These bars were engraved with a match-pair using the English word meticulous and its Latin forerunner metus, meaning ‘fear, dread’. The modern usage of meticulous had arisen just a few decades before in France, with the connotation of being fearful of making a mistake. (Location 3956)
