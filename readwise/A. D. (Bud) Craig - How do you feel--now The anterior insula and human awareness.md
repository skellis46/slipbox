## Highlights

> Critchley et al. reported functional MRI (fMRI) and morphometric data indicating a specific role for the right AIC in heart­ beat awareness3, an interoceptive measure that correlates with individual subjective emotional awareness4.

> Finally, activation was observed in the bilat­ eral AIC (right side (R)>left side (L)) during non­painful oesophageal distention or view­ ing of fearful faces, and such activation dis­ played synergistic enhancement when these stimuli were delivered simultaneously6, sug­ gesting that emotional states are integrated with interoceptive states in the representation of the subjective feelings of the moment.

> The evidence at that time indicated that the anterior insular cortex (AIC) (FIG. 1) contains interoceptive re­ representations that substantialize (that is, provide the basis for) all subjective feel­ ings from the body and perhaps emotional awareness, consistent with the essence of the James–Lange theory of emotion and Damasio’s ‘somatic marker’ hypothesis.

> Pain is a significant interoceptive feeling, and four recent pain studies are noteworthy here. One study reported that noxious heat stimulation of the left or right hand activated the contralateral dorsal posterior insula, the bilateral mid­insula (R>L) and, when the subject attended to the stimulus, the right AIC (R>>L)7. Another study reported that the objective intensity of a heat pain stimulus correlated with activation in the posterior insula, whereas the subjective eval­ uation of heat pain correlated with activation in the bilateral AIC (R>L)8.

> The available evidence suggests strongly that the AIC has a fundamental role in human awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbwx0yyg1tss0wg42y5d95x9))

> Almost all recent imaging studies of emotion report joint acti­ vation of the AIC and the ACC in subjects experiencing emotional feelings, including maternal and romantic love, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, sexual arousal, disgust, aversion, unfairness, inequity, indigna­ tion, uncertainty, disbelief, social exclusion, trust, empathy, sculptural beauty, a ‘state of union with God’, and a hallucinogenic state (induced by ayahuasca). Thus, the AIC is activated not just in association with subjec­ tive feelings from the body, but apparently with all subjective feelings.

> During both types of visual self­recognition the authors found selective activation of the AIC and the adja­ cent IFG and ACC, all on the right side.
>  They suggested that the right AIC and ACC “could give rise to an abstract representation of oneself that could possibly participate in maintaining a sense of self”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbwxhfssyg5180a2bbtbsme3))

>  task was used to encourage mind­wandering

>  authors found activation associated with
>  self­reported mind­wandering periods

> The results highlighted in the categories ‘Interoception’, ‘Awareness of body move­ ment’ and ‘Emotional awareness’ indicate that the AIC provides a unique neural sub­ strate that instantiates all subjective feelings from the body and feelings of emotion in the immediate present (now).

> What is awareness? until we know more
>  about how brains work, only a working
>  definition is possible. I regard awareness as
>  knowing that one exists (the feeling that ‘I
>  am’); an organism must be able to experience
>  its own existence as a sentient being before
>  it can experience the existence and salience
>  of anything else in the environment. One
>  proposal holds that awareness of any object
>  requires, first, a mental representation of
>  oneself as a feeling (sentient) entity; second,
>  a mental representation of that object; and
>  third, a mental representation of the salient
>  interrelationship between oneself and that
>  object in the immediate moment (‘now’)49,50
>  .
>  As in Damasio’s “neural self” (ReF. 51), this
>  formulation inherently creates a subjective
>  (‘personal’) perspective that differentiates
>  inner and outer realms, because the inner
>  feelings that underlie one’s representation of
>  oneself as a sentient being are accessible only

> No other region of the brain is activated in all of these tasks, and the only feature that is common to all of these tasks is that they engage the awareness of the subjects. Thus, in my opinion, the accumulated evidence compels the hypothesis that the AIC engenders human awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbwzptswem9senge9fvstwg9))

> Thus, the available data provide compelling support for the concept that the AIC contains the anatomical substrate for the evolved capacity of humans to be aware of themselves, others and the environment. In my opinion, these data suggest that the AIC uniquely fulfils the requirements to be the neural correlate of awareness.

> These data recommend a discussion of the possibility that the AIC is a “neural correlate of consciousness” (ReF. 77) and of the question of how the AIC might engender awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx0yd7hcht1sxnamhdzqqme))

> The salience of any factor is determined by its significance for the maintenance and advancement of the individual and the species. At the most fundamental level, this means the energy­ efficient maintenance of the health of the physical body (and the brain) — in other words, homeostasis. In this view, the neural basis for awareness is the neural representa­ tion of the physiological condition of the body, and the homeostatic neural construct for a feeling from the body is the foundation for the encoding of all feelings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx14w1tf84genr3yv4456tq))

> The neuropsychological construct called a ‘feeling’ is crucial. Why is it important that this construct has a homeostatic basis? What do feelings from the body and feelings about objects or people or cognitions have in common? Do all feelings have autonomic sequelae — that is, do they ‘move the heart’? Can every thought be regarded as a feeling? Are feelings indeed the common currency of awareness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbx1gg64177kp3n6xgf5e3f7))
