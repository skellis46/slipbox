- I declare this the Year of Focal Practices.
  What do I mean by that? It’s a concept from Albert Borgmann’s seminal 1984 book [*Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Technology_and_the_Character_of_Contempo/GdonAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover). As Borgmann’s career moved on he became a clearer and more straightforward writer, but in 1984 … not so much. He was still, then, too Heideggerian to be lucid.

- *Focus* is a Latin word that means *hearth* — the fireplace that was both literally and metaphorically the center of the Roman household. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpc96hf9rescqers8n7m4kgj))
- Controlled fire is of course the paradigmatic technology: Prometheus’s gift of fire to humans is the definitive [extension](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Understanding_Media/TcsSvgAACAAJ?hl=en) of our natural abilities, an augmentation of power, a prosthesis. But, Borgmann shows, fire-as-*focus* is much more than that: it generates a set of **focal practices** that strengthen the bonds among members of the family. Contrast the hearth at the center of a home to a central heating unit, which instead of binding us to one another invites us to go our separate ways. The central heating unit is not a *focus* that links us to one another; it is rather a *device* that facilitates our separation.

- The idea that our technological prostheses are meant to generate independence from one another is a way of thinking about technology that Borgmann calls the *device paradigm*. To summarize an argument I have made [here](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/from-tech-critique-to-ways-of-living), the device paradigm promises freedom but in fact — after all, it cannot be modified to suit our needs — enforces what Ursula Franklin calls a “culture of compliance.” It is, as Ivan Illich would put it, a *manipulatory* technology, whereas the hearth is a *convivial* one.
