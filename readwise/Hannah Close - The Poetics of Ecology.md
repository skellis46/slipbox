## Highlights
- The biosphere, Weber proposes, is the creative expression of a universal desire to be in relationship. Even the smallest particles of matter express the primordial need to get in touch with others in order to undergo transformations necessary to being alive.

- being an organism means being flush with feeling and the desire to be alive, and to be wholly expressed in that aliveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv66w56n5kn86wxb3td3kn3))
- Ecology looks at how species and individuals relate in order to create new life. Poetic ecology looks at these relations from the perspective of subjectivity and meaning. So it’s not about cause and effect; instead, it’s about the expressiveness of a living reality whose creative process is constantly bringing forth a multitude of fertile relationships. In my view, any thinking in terms of relationship can only come about as a poetics. Any practice of aliveness can only be a poetic practice. A poetic ecology understands nature less as an economy of checks and balances than as the creative interpenetration of sentient beings, so it is animistic in that way.

- If we wander through a flowering meadow in May, we become enmeshed in this tactile exchange. When we look closely, we may recognise that our nervous system mirrors the infinite mycorrhizal networks beneath our feet. We are intertwined across this threshold through sensation, perception, and organic memory, kind of like an umbilical cord, or what the mythologist Martin Shaw calls ‘bone memory’. That’s why we find it enlivening; it rouses our own creaturehood. It reminds us of our place in the natural world and of our intimate belonging to the Earth; we realise we are not so alien after all.

- I use enlivenment as a mirror concept to enlightenment. Where ‘The Enlightenment’ was striving for the emancipation of the autonomous rational subject, enlivenment is about the re-animation of the embodied inter-being. From the perspective of enlivenment, the whole world is teeming with aliveness, and we’re a part of this continually emerging process. So it’s a sort of propagation of a new enlightenment, only this time it’s about sharing life, not about defending sovereign individual rationality.

- To become enlivened means to inhabit your aliveness through relationship. Of course, we are alive right now, but many of us are not *inhabiting* our lives, nor are we relating through any sense of reciprocity. Embodiment is necessary, but it refers explicitly to the body, not to life itself. Enlivenment is almost *infusing* oneself with life.

- These callous acts deny beings participation in the mutual interactions of flesh in the living biosphere. People who feel alienated mirror this situation because their civilisation mirrors the catastrophe at hand. Capitalist civilisation is an onslaught on aliveness.

- Today I would say we’re individuals *because* we’re colonies. My teacher, Francisco Varela, coined this beautiful phrase. He said, ‘as organisms, we are a meshwork of selfless selves’. We’re ecosystems. This microbial ecosystem inside of you is in constant dialogue with the ecosystem(s) outside of you. Your gut biota are continuously replenished by the stuff you eat because it’s full of bacteria. Your skin microbiome deposits itself on everything you touch. If you touch somebody, you exchange microbiomes. You don’t have a border. To think so is another bourgeois Western illusion. In actuality, you’re constantly blurring with the animate world around you. This is the ‘conversational nature of reality’ the poet David Whyte talks about.

- Do you know why you find this unnerving? Because it shows you that you’re really this world around you, and one day you will be again, only you’ll be an ecosystem without an individual. We go back to the soil from which we came – few living in modern cultures appreciate the extraordinary beauty of such a truth. It’s unnerving because it’s about losing control, and our civilisation is terrified of that. It’s also about paradox. You’re not allowed to decide if you’re a colony or an individual; you’re both. Isn’t that very much about being open to difference and otherness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv6b65jv2x38fvfw84tc7dz))
- Living connections depend on two basic things: allowing the self to exist while at the same time helping other(s) come alive. We lack this idea of reciprocity in our relationships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv6ctc03fm6tdheedfhyqfb))
- But death means becoming edible again; it means becoming compost, mycelium, nitrogen and so on, ultimately putting yourself in service to life. If we look at the metabolism of a living cell, we see that it is constantly decaying. It breaks down and is built again. That’s precisely the core of your aliveness: putting yourself together again. Undying. But not avoiding death. Immortality, which is so worshipped by our civilisation, is the biggest ecological mistake you can make. Death is an integral part of life, as is birth. Every breath mediates the two – literally. You could label that mediation with radionuclides and see that your body gradually dies over into the bodies of the plants in your garden. If you understand this cosmos as fundamentally alive, you’ll see that there is no way out of this life. There is just a continuous unravelling into otherness. Death is metamorphosis. Death is becoming kin with the earth. It is intimate ecological embrace. The system of living relationships only works because everyone is edible.
