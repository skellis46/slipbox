## Highlights
- I am using the term commons to stand for relation-
  ships of reciprocity and mutual co-­creation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv72rapead5djq9xawrw1pt))
- At the same time, I am not proposing a Utopia. On the
  contrary: I only intend to call for more tenderness toward
  what is really there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7c9ag7c8qgxfrvs2c9eyd))
- The freedom that enlivenment seeks to
  advance does not revoke these aims. It rather substitutes
  them with our freedom as individuals and groups to be
  “alive-­in-­connectedness”—­the freedom that comes from
  aligning individual needs and interests with those of the
  larger community. The self is always a function of the whole:
  the whole, however, is equally a function of the individual.
  Only this integrated freedom can provide the power to rec-
  oncile humanity with the natural world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv79tt4cr9ydy70adkz5383))
- Freedom becomes manifest only when indi-
  vidual needs and interests are imagined together with those
  of greater communities in a precarious, tense, even para-
  doxical balance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7nz7s5ny3zxjxz0ty6f0t))
- The mainstream
  treatment of our manifold dilemmas is to sort out various
  problems in separate “silos” and then search for single, spe-
  cific “solutions.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7nf8aa346mz1rpzx0w5nw))
- If we are to
  recover reliable reference points for sustainable living, and
  in so doing find the wisdom to confront the manifold crises
  of our time, we must first look for a fresh account of the
  principles of existence of living beings. This requires that
  we carefully reconsider how relationships in the biosphere
  are organized—­and experienced—­and that we start not by
  just looking at them from the outside, but by remember-
  ing that we are already a feeling part of such relationships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7masr3ke765nv6vcye724))
- Ecology is a
  steady-­state economy. It does not grow; it evolves. The only
  factor of nature that expands is its immaterial dimension,
  which could be called a depth of experience: the diversity
  of natural forms and the variety of ways to experience
  aliveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7sx7kkf6me7akzak9brc2))
- Physical science for a long time now has been able to
  show that the separation of an observer (subject) and an
  observed phenomenon (object) is an artifact of causal-­
  mechanic, linear thought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7vbngmw3qqvym6jxykjzy))
- For commons
  thinking, economic processes consist of flows of matter
  and relations in an ecosystem. These don’t just center on ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7w9hev3sc7g3m4q6j6282))
- goods, but also create lived meaning. Allocation and sense-­
  making are inseparable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gkv7wc4h7xgq9h9ej8x7tft5))
- The “flesh of the world” is a desire for touch and con-
  nection manifesting itself in living gestures of aliveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5ve4m9jgh8j9tt7hawy6wr))
- The world’s interior is forever ungraspable as totality. But
  it can be approached and embraced as individuality. Its
  interior permeates the uncountable permutations of the
  surface of things, which in turn become the sensitive skin
  of a vulnerable flesh. This flesh vibrates with a continuous
  desire to be touched, to touch, and to make itself feel. The
  world is sentience because it is matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5vgzqt2nax8ahcgbsmag5t))
- We need the regard of
  the most unknown in order to come to terms with that
  which is part of us but beyond our grasp. We need to be
  touched by matter in order to understand that we are matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gm5vk12e4sh1xq5s5z2jerw0))
