## Highlights
- There are two important elements in these opening verses: the repeated phrase “for the time being” and the unique moments, things, or events that it modifies. The individual moments, things, or events are called ju-hoi or “dharma positions.” A dharma position is a singular moment, state of being, or occurrence that has no fixed duration and about which we intuitively understand something of its particularity. Standing on the highest mountain peak, moving along the ocean floor, being a wrathful deity with three heads and eight arms or a golden buddha of eight or sixteen feet, a staff, a whisk, a pillar, a lantern, Mr. Chang, Mr. Li, the great earth, and the heavens above are all dharma positions.

- The translations of uji as “for the time being,” “sometimes,” “at a certain time,” or “once” can be read as a kind of throwaway line, especially in English. Our tendency may be to skip over these words and move on to what seems to be the meat of each sentence. But for Dogen, “for the time being” is the whole basis for his discussion of time’s relationship to being. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvgd1r56h2zqwfqzrqyk04))
- Understanding the multiplicity of meanings within the phrase “for the time being” reveals new depths in Dogen’s opening lines. For Dogen, “for the time being” encompasses all states of being–time. Rereading the opening of *Uji* in light of this understanding, we find several meanings within each situation: “a particular time-being stands on the highest mountain peak,” “the time when one stands on the highest mountain peak,” “all being(s)-time(s) stand on the highest peak,” or “all time’s being and/or all beings’ time is now standing on the highest peak.” We can read the remaining lines in the same ways. No single thing and no moment of time is left out of this very moment of being–time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvgz24zavmrvb1r6qnr5ms))
- Without understanding the encompassing nature of a dharma position as a being–time and all being–time, we mistakenly experience unique particular moments like the Buddhist parable of the blind men examining an elephant. One man said the ears were like a basket, another said the tusk was a plow’s blade, and a third thought the foot to be a pillar—you get the idea. Since the examiners were blind, not one of them was able to see the whole of the elephant, so they grasped what they could and compared it to something they already knew, not understanding that each thing they touched was a part of a larger unseen whole.

    - Note: Not unlike examining art. We notice what we know
- in *Uji* Dogen is concerned with the nondual nature of time and being as expressed in the presencing moment. From the point of view of practice, a linear view of time can impede realization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvmkkf32k05bzffwfrmpyh))
- We are aware of past experience and future desires when actualizing our enlightened mind, but such ideas do not obstruct our ability to respond fully to the totality of each situation as it is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvn7pzcsqe833evtcksa0q))
- This nonobstructive awareness is important because the independent nature of a dharma position allows us to choose how we will respond to them. We are not caught up in some fatalistic, predetermined course of action. Dogen writes in *Hotsu-Bodaishin* (“Establishment of the Bodhi-Mind”): ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvngmzty7rkqdhk4ftzk9j))
- Here we have what appear to be two opposing ideas: the future of firewood is ash and the past of ash is firewood, and yet the past and future of firewood and ash are cut off from what seems like their natural progression. Each statement is equally true and important to our understanding of a dharma position or a being–time. We do have a past and future, but we are not bound by a fossilized past or future. We use our past experiences and future desires as tools for discernment. If we can engage with the present moment in this way, we are freed to respond to this moment unobstructed by motivations that might hinder a skillful response.

- When we include everything in our understanding, we are more cognizant of the intrinsic value of each thing, and we are more aware of the place each being or event has in relationship to us. We don’t exclude anything, recognizing that everything is already present. Accepting things as they are is predicated upon knowing that the present includes all those things we want and those things we don’t want. We cannot reject anything merely because it causes us discomfort or does not fit our idea of how it should be. Our suffering arises from this overlay of likes and dislikes, but truthfully there is nothing obstructing the fully realized moment because nothing is excluded and all things arise simultaneously.

- Our interconnecting, interpenetrating, unobstructed nature is the basis for intelligent empathy resulting in compassionate and wise action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfwcjr6vdmcr6n6wbba8661))
