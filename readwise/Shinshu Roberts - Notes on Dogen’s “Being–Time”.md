## Highlights
- There are two important elements in these opening verses: the repeated phrase “for the time being” and the unique moments, things, or events that it modifies. The individual moments, things, or events are called ju-hoi or “dharma positions.” A dharma position is a singular moment, state of being, or occurrence that has no fixed duration and about which we intuitively understand something of its particularity. Standing on the highest mountain peak, moving along the ocean floor, being a wrathful deity with three heads and eight arms or a golden buddha of eight or sixteen feet, a staff, a whisk, a pillar, a lantern, Mr. Chang, Mr. Li, the great earth, and the heavens above are all dharma positions.

- The translations of uji as “for the time being,” “sometimes,” “at a certain time,” or “once” can be read as a kind of throwaway line, especially in English. Our tendency may be to skip over these words and move on to what seems to be the meat of each sentence. But for Dogen, “for the time being” is the whole basis for his discussion of time’s relationship to being. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvgd1r56h2zqwfqzrqyk04))
- Understanding the multiplicity of meanings within the phrase “for the time being” reveals new depths in Dogen’s opening lines. For Dogen, “for the time being” encompasses all states of being–time. Rereading the opening of *Uji* in light of this understanding, we find several meanings within each situation: “a particular time-being stands on the highest mountain peak,” “the time when one stands on the highest mountain peak,” “all being(s)-time(s) stand on the highest peak,” or “all time’s being and/or all beings’ time is now standing on the highest peak.” We can read the remaining lines in the same ways. No single thing and no moment of time is left out of this very moment of being–time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvgz24zavmrvb1r6qnr5ms))
- Without understanding the encompassing nature of a dharma position as a being–time and all being–time, we mistakenly experience unique particular moments like the Buddhist parable of the blind men examining an elephant. One man said the ears were like a basket, another said the tusk was a plow’s blade, and a third thought the foot to be a pillar—you get the idea. Since the examiners were blind, not one of them was able to see the whole of the elephant, so they grasped what they could and compared it to something they already knew, not understanding that each thing they touched was a part of a larger unseen whole.

    - Note: Not unlike examining art. We notice what we know
- in *Uji* Dogen is concerned with the nondual nature of time and being as expressed in the presencing moment. From the point of view of practice, a linear view of time can impede realization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvmkkf32k05bzffwfrmpyh))
- We are aware of past experience and future desires when actualizing our enlightened mind, but such ideas do not obstruct our ability to respond fully to the totality of each situation as it is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvn7pzcsqe833evtcksa0q))
- This nonobstructive awareness is important because the independent nature of a dharma position allows us to choose how we will respond to them. We are not caught up in some fatalistic, predetermined course of action. Dogen writes in *Hotsu-Bodaishin* (“Establishment of the Bodhi-Mind”): ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfvngmzty7rkqdhk4ftzk9j))
- Here we have what appear to be two opposing ideas: the future of firewood is ash and the past of ash is firewood, and yet the past and future of firewood and ash are cut off from what seems like their natural progression. Each statement is equally true and important to our understanding of a dharma position or a being–time. We do have a past and future, but we are not bound by a fossilized past or future. We use our past experiences and future desires as tools for discernment. If we can engage with the present moment in this way, we are freed to respond to this moment unobstructed by motivations that might hinder a skillful response.

- When we include everything in our understanding, we are more cognizant of the intrinsic value of each thing, and we are more aware of the place each being or event has in relationship to us. We don’t exclude anything, recognizing that everything is already present. Accepting things as they are is predicated upon knowing that the present includes all those things we want and those things we don’t want. We cannot reject anything merely because it causes us discomfort or does not fit our idea of how it should be. Our suffering arises from this overlay of likes and dislikes, but truthfully there is nothing obstructing the fully realized moment because nothing is excluded and all things arise simultaneously.

- Our interconnecting, interpenetrating, unobstructed nature is the basis for intelligent empathy resulting in compassionate and wise action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpfwcjr6vdmcr6n6wbba8661))

- When we realize the nondual nature of a dharma position or particular being–time, we can include everything and avoid getting caught in a constricting story about our current situation. Making up a defining story line takes us further away from the true state of our experience. For example, we may find ourselves wanting to deny our own unskillfulness (the three-headed demon) because it doesn’t fit our idea of a Buddhist practitioner. Denying our difficulties will only draw them forward, often when we least expect or want them to arise.
  It is only when we accept and investigate our experience as flawed human beings that we begin to exhibit wisdom and recognize the totality of our life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph39zrpk3rw07w86jpwh2ah))
- Dogen writes in *Sesshin Sessho* (“Speaking of Mind, Speaking of Essence”):
  From the time we establish the bodhi-mind and direct ourselves toward training in the way of Buddha, we sincerely practice difficult practices; and at that time, though we keep practicing, in a hundred efforts we never hit the target once. Nevertheless, sometimes following good counselors and sometime following the sutras, we gradually become able to hit the target. One hit of the target now is by virtue of hundreds of misses in the past; it is one maturation of hundreds of misses.
  —translation by Nishijima and Cross, *Master Dogen’s Shobogenzo* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph3azp0tnf5enpgfr2pvw4d))
- We will never hit the target if we refuse to realize that our arrows are missing. Missing the target is not about being a good or a bad person; it is just our sincere effort to hit the target of skillful means. Our human life, the arrow, and the target are not different. Missing and hitting are not opposites, as long as we are sincerely present for our life as it unfolds within the being–time of self and others practicing together. Including both is the key concept here. If we only think of this moment as a reflection of our individual needs, then we miss the mark. We must include the totality of both self and other, then act in accord. This is the basis of sincerely shooting the arrow.

- Conventionally, we understand practice as the stone lantern and outdoor pillar and realization as the whisk and staff; we think of practice as before and realization as after. In truth, realization is fully expressed in practice. Even as we endeavor to learn practice, we are exhibiting the mind of realization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph3qvksev3repk7nnxkpja5))
- Dogen expresses this when he writes in *Bendowa* (“Wholehearted Practice of the Way”):
  To suppose that practice and realization are not one is nothing but a heretical view; in buddha-dharma they are inseparable. Because practice of the present moment is practice-realization, the practice of beginner’s mind is in itself the entire original realization. Therefore, when we give instructions for practicing we say that you should not have any expectation for realization outside of practice, since this is the immediate original realization. Because this is the realization of practice, there is no boundary in the realization. Because this is the practice of realization, there is no beginning in practice.
  —translation by Tanahashi, *Moon in a Dewdrop: Writings of Zen Master Dogen* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph3sk8qmmykxva20yswnwgy))
- Mr. Chang or Mr. Li” is the same as saying “every Tom, Dick, or Harry” in English. Yet, as common as we are, when we look into the night sky, do we also recall that we too are made of stars? The true nature of our life is that we are not separate, we inter-are (as the Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh would say). We know from scientific study that the carbon from the Big Bang is also in us and in all things. We know from observation that in this very moment we are dependent upon heaven, earth, and everything in between for our very life. We cannot live without air and water. We are dependent upon and enmeshed with all beings for all time, at this moment. Yet we persist in thinking there is a disconnect between ourselves and others. What a trick our senses play on us! This great life of the cosmos is just the everyday life of the common person. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph3xva0qypqvs1ynb2m8xk8))
- If our worldview is a being–time that entertains all possibilities, this enables us to let go of our attachment to any particular ideas about our situation and thereby actualize the totality of the moment. Our being–time’s moment must include all being(s)–time(s). When this inclusivity is actualized, we are fully present with whatever is happening in its totality and we respond. This response is unobstructed. It alleviates suffering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gph3znercw32p7grhg05sxn1))
