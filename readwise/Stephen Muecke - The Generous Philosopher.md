## Highlights

> Latour’s approach is radical because it shows just how active nonhumans have been in human affairs. His work calls for new political strategies that can acknowledge humans aren’t the only ones enrolled in the production of truth. In his view, forms of ‘nature’ – including nonhumans such as mountains, voodoo dolls, policy documents or door stoppers – are woven together in *political* networks. To use his phrase, they form a ‘political ecology’. If this is ‘ecology’, it is a particularly French kind. Among Latour’s many actors we find none of the piety of the North American wilderness tradition associated with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who sought spiritual transcendence in pristine nature. The ecology Latour was developing is practical, earthbound and problem-oriented. So where did he get his ideas? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpxzzxyphw84cjecc22jwpmm))


> Latour had different, but parallel, ideas and found himself at odds with Marxist critical orthodoxy. Despite their anti-humanism, these thinkers viewed society as composed of *human* groupings alone – humans seemed to be the only real actors who mattered. Latour wanted to attribute power to nonhuman actors as well. He saw that not all forces were under our control, from germs to steam engines. This seemingly small idea was a direct challenge to the foundations of modern thought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy06ahvz18rq1gmgy707z6f))


> Latour’s early book *Nous n’avons jamais été modernes* (1991) – later [translated](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674948396) into English as *We Have Never Been Modern* (1993) – was an attempt to deflate this triumphalism. It asked disconcerting questions about where some of our most trusted institutions, particularly the sciences, were taking us. Latour queried the extent to which these institutions embraced the idea that universal truths about the natural world can be ‘discovered’ through positivist scientific work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy07f55tn4gb324hccqqzf0))


> Instead, Latour and his colleagues presented scientific knowledge as a deliberate construction, a product of various social, political and economic interactions that are in constant competition. This pluralist view of knowledge is at the origins of the field of science and technology studies, which critically analyses the sciences while also trying to build bridges with the humanities – between ‘matters of fact’ and ‘matters of concern’, as Latour put it. Latour was a founder of what would become the field’s main approach, actor-network theory. This is not so much a theory as a method. It asks us to follow the nonhuman actors doing things to each other, and to not focus on the artificial oppositions we have built between, for instance, subject and object. That opposition is at the heart of positivist science, which tends to insist that facts are just waiting to be discovered in an objective world and, once discovered, become permanent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy08xwree64vtw8fe7562fg))


> Latour might respond by saying he is very happy with the laws of physics – with facts – but he just wants to know where they come from, which involves a more complicated story than ‘just waiting to be discovered’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy0azq5xr8r2py6bqw745wv))


> According to Latour, facts have careers, which highlights his argument for pluralism. At one time it was a fact that asbestos was harmless, stable, fire-resistant and termite-proof – an excellent building material. We mined it and made it part of our world. But these facts soon went into competition with facts from the world of medicine about mesothelioma (a cancer caused by asbestos). Next, asbestos-producing industries were taken to court where legal truths were established for the benefit of the victims, and asbestos was expelled from our domestic world. This plurality of institutionally based knowledges thus *battled* to decide the fate of a far-from-passive actor, and no one could afford to discount any of them in advance.

> Ethnographers make detailed empirical descriptions through embedded observation, but they also ask awkward questions revealing that what scientists might *claim* is ‘pure science’ depends on an array of nonscientific activities: funding bodies, technical instruments, debates, curiosity, collegiality, legal battles, and so on. It was Latour and Woolgar’s innovation to dispassionately describe the network of all these contingencies and effects. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy0g62g1wwpz5f7q350108c))

> The observer is in the middle of a network in which scientific facts are being carefully coaxed into being, verified through repetition and peer review, and finally published. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy0jr0q6dbb59x6s32q0t0y))


> Latour, though seen as poking holes in ‘facts’ (and supposedly weakening scientific truth), would defend the sciences with a little qualifier: the truth has to be *well* constructed, it isn’t ‘just’ constructed. Simply *claiming* objectivity, and in the process bracketing out all subjectivity, is not part of a realistic description of what goes on when science does a good job and establishes a truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy0mvt5xn674vm9awj35c8k))


> Just as each branch of science rarely solves problems on its own – physics might need algebra; sociology might need a bit of geography or statistics – a realistic description must embrace a heterogenous array of actors. This was the basis of Latour’s pluralism. He would later develop this view of heterogeneity into a system based on *multiple ontologies,* allowing himself a dig at those philosophers who recognise only two sides to reality, the objective and the subjective – ‘two hooks’, Latour joked, to ‘suspend a hammock destined for philosophical snoozing’. Everything such snoozers encounter is heading either to the status of the solid brick or towards that of ineffable human consciousness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy0qsrmr7mk1gktfscq29yn))


> Rather, everything is real, and it is approached with a rigorously empirical and experimental attitude. This means that everything is a work in progress, a negotiable alliance of things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy0z4tzw71w1wf4ekcey3fg))


> It is a work in progress where the ongoing effort makes something gel; its reality can’t be given in advance or summarised, which would reduce it to dogma. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy112weeph4ds7vq8g5e5da))


> So, are we now in a ‘post-truth’ era? Latour acknowledged the dangers of our ‘post-truth era’ and responded in his own signature way: our current ecological issues won’t be solved by treating the climate as an objective phenomenon, but instead by focusing on the ways that climatic changes are tied up with politics and the interests of big business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy12crcccccar47hsk46y8t))


> Paradoxically, finding solutions to a *common* crisis like the climate requires a *plurality* of knowledges. Solutions to problems like these need to come from all fronts. Reductionism is not going to help us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy149eesgn3zmykmp2wghe0))


> It was late winter, and while driving along ‘the road from Dijon to Gray’, he recounts, ‘I was forced to stop, brought to my senses by an overdose of reductionism.’ For Latour, reductionism is epistemic arrogance. We might see this arrogance when a physicist laughs at someone who is not immediately aware that ‘everything is made up of atoms’; or when a social psychologist reduces religious belief to ‘human behaviour’, after doing a quick study of the Catholic mass; or when a political advisor tells the world that: ‘It’s the economy, stupid.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy16530xjypgxd97kmpvjzm))


> Nothing can be reduced to anything else, nothing can be deduced from anything else, everything may be allied to everything else.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy199z7z4m761ykj24cpxav))


> But rather than demolishing Latour’s call to view ‘things unreduced’, these counterexamples only bolster his claim: truths are not always solid and cumulative, they can be fragile and in need of constant maintenance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy18mhppcrc88qgncjjst6f))


> Such an anthropology required a new method for writing descriptions of *unreduced* relations. Latour [proposed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40878163) actor-network theory, a radical, even revolutionary, way of seeing the world that recognised the agencies of all that is nonhuman: objects, machines, animals, plants and even Earth itself. A plain, scientific, objective description is not enough if an ethnographer hopes to describe *what is going on* when a scientist makes a discovery. ‘What is going on’ is actually a messy hybrid of agencies, a plurality of ontologies, and Latour had to develop a writing style to bring out their precarious existences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1a8r3x319yycvsbne20yk))


> Against a long tradition of considering agency only if it has human intentions attached to it, Latour was simply being agnostic about what agency might pop up in any given situation – humans aren’t the only ones who can change the course of history. This was a radical proposal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1b9s29j4616fdxb3191b1))


> Latour was effectively including nonhumans in ‘society’, revolutionising what we might mean by that common, overworked, reductive concept. By viewing science in this way, Latour was suggesting that knowledge was a co-production. Scientists weren’t the only ones involved in making fragile truths. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1brz5n3jeyj1c150s633n))


> But true to his ‘irreductionist’ principle, Latour was arguing that any ‘same footing’ needs to be built up, and that the grounds for each way of being in the world, each ontology, must be described according to its unique capabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1dvk0dezj1kgak4rndwta))


> It was a ‘radically empiricist’ approach, to use a phrase from the American philosopher and psychologist [William James](https://aeon.co/essays/is-life-worth-living-the-pragmatic-maybe-of-william-james). In the 1990s, Latour increasingly turned to similar American [pragmatist philosophers](https://aeon.co/essays/pragmatism-is-one-of-the-most-successful-idioms-in-philosophy) of the early 20th century, to develop an empiricism that suited the descriptive work demanded by actor-network theory. Radical empiricism allows one to build descriptions of networks, not as firm structures but as ongoing processes. It’s an assertion that the *relations* between things are just as real as the things themselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1ehndmwvmr9nvs34app5b))


> Relations are the links in actor-networks, which we can describe based on experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1f7bc6swcg6g94xh1p756))


> After Latour, society is a network of associations to be composed, to be negotiated among beings who speak different languages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy1x80r5dsxt1bhntpd5zcs))


> In *Enquête sur les modes d’existence: Une anthropologie des Modernes* (2012), in English *An Inquiry into Modes of existence: An Anthropology of the Moderns* (2013), Latour deals with 15 different modes of existence, or ontologies, including political, economic, referential (scientific), reproductive (living), technological, fictional, legal, moral, and more. Each is equally real, each has its own ‘felicity conditions’ enabling it to proceed through the world in its own particular way. One cannot be reduced to another, or dominate another, without impoverishing this kind of world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy24nbyyk34fye84vxxcy3r))


> Climate change is not just a phenomenon, it has the potential to usher in a new civilisation if we respond adequately, which is partially why he preferred to refer to it as the ‘new climatic regime’ – all our institutions, our ways of knowing, would be subject to radical changes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy2356gtw66etfam8gfdabn))


> Humans have *caused* the climate to change, so it is no longer external to ‘us’ in the way that we used to think when we were happy to see ourselves in ‘culture’, while everything else – animals, plants, stars, climate – was in an objective and largely passive ‘nature’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy23sc85jajqbt26dt88q69))


> As Latour wrote in *Où atterrir – comment s’orienter en politique* (2017), in English *Down to Earth* (2018): ‘we can understand nothing about the politics of the last 50 years if we do not put the question of climate change and its denial front and centre.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gpy25ahx16recwr95xnbsddc))


> Latour’s thought and method is a bit like that of the German polymath Alexander von Humboldt, who travelled the world in the 18th and 19th centuries – as a scientist, philosopher, and artist – immersing himself in different environments, making scientific calculations, philosophical interpretations, and even drawings. Both practised methods of careful, detailed description that reached across disciplinary boundaries. The ‘two cultures’ [divide](https://aeon.co/essays/why-should-science-have-the-last-word-on-culture) between the sciences and the humanities emerged only later, and it is as irrelevant today as the corresponding *artificial* division between nature and culture – artificial because our pluralist worlds are better described in a multirealist fashion.
