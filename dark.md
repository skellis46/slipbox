# dark

My current movement practice -- other than yoga -- is Helen Poynor's year-long [Walk of Life training](https://www.walkoflife.co.uk/). I've written about Helen's work [before in this newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/a76a93679fc5/weathering-the-weather) and a key part of the training is practicing outdoors. 

The days are still short here in the UK and this means I'm training in the dark. I head out at about 6am to a common area filled with trees (hilariously called "Jungle Walk"). Even under a full moon the canopy keeps the site dark; not pitch-black but dark enough to keep my bodily experience close while noticing that particular alertness to sound we animals have in such conditions. By "close" I mean the way it feels as if the darkness is compressing my attention towards my body's surfaces. My understanding of the space is through elemental non-visual sensations: the cold on skin, the smell of the rotting leaves, the sound of early birds. It is deeply nourishing and I notice just how much my attention slows down in the dark while tuning to the body. 

Here are a couple of photos taken back in November.

My original plan had been to shoot these on a very long exposure with no added light. But I bumped into the limits of my (now very old) DSLR and instead shone a dim bike light towards the tree. For those of you interested, the images were shot as RAW files, ISO100, 27mm lens, f/8 and 15 seconds exposure. I definitely could have bumped up the ISO but would have introduced a lot of noise and, as it turns out, I've just learned that there is a slight hack I could have used to expose the sensor for longer than the usual 30 second limit. I'll give it another go.
