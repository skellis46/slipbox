# the overlap between bodily and emotional feelings

_previous note:_ [[interoceptive accuracy correlations]]

This trade press article by Cambridge neuroscientist Camilla Nord summarises research on the relationship between bodily feelings and emotions.

> Often, you can’t see, hear, touch, smell or taste information about the internal state of your body. Instead, you use a sense known as ‘interoception’ (in contrast to ‘exteroception’, which is how you sense the outside of the body via vision, taste, smell, touch and hearing). The notion of interoception was conceived more than 100 years ago when Charles Sherrington proposed the idea of there being specialised receptors inside the body that send information from our organ systems to the brain.

> interpreting your emotional feelings has a surprising amount in common with interpreting your bodily states. One example is judging whether you are feeling stressed rather than hungry. Both involve physical changes in the body: when you’re hungry, your stomach rumbles, you might feel weak; when you’re stressed, your heart and breathing rate increase, perhaps you even sweat or shiver. Perceiving and interpreting these physical changes in both cases involves interoception.

> When you close your eyes and assess how your body feels, you are using interoception. This is not a passive process – it’s not a simple case of unambiguous signals arising from receptors inside your body. Sometimes, different bodily sensations can feel very similar, making it hard to ascertain their origin. Do you feel hungry, or nauseous? Are you sweating from heat, or nerves? To read this uncertain signal, your brain uses clues from other factors: where you are, what you have recently done, what sensations your body has experienced before, and so on. 

> An important implication of this subjectivity is that the different bodily experiences associated with certain mental health disorders might not come directly from what’s happening in the stomach, heart or other internal organ, but rather from how the brain interprets and processes the signals arising from those organs. Indeed, interoception is experienced differently by people with various mental health diagnoses, which has led scientists to theorise recently that there might be a basic difference in how the brains of people with mental health conditions process bodily sensations.

> It’s increasingly apparent that interoception is essential for more than just survival. It’s the very filter through which we feel mentally and physically well, or unwell.
