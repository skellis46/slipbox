# noesis and noetic understanding

_previous note:_ [[harmful content project preparation]]

> The noesis is the part of the act that gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, etc.) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)#Noesis_and_noema> -- this is from Husserl's phenomenology

- [[body being known]]
- [[the body in artistic research]]
- [[Bakewell - At the existentialist cafe]]
- [[I move precedes I can]]

- for clearer explanation see [[Ekua Hagan - What Are Noetic Sciences#^ab29fa]]
- more like it is akin to the subjective which Hagan makes quite clear
- comes from the word _nous_ and noetics literally means "the proper use of nous" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noetics>)

- note that "[Quackwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quackwatch)Â lists the Institute of Noetic Science on its Questionable Organizations list." -- [[Ekua Hagan - What Are Noetic Sciences]]
