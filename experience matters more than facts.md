# experience matters more than facts

_previous note:_ 

* The post responds to a UK news story about Miles Richardson’s Derby study finding spirituality is the strongest predictor of nature connectedness.
* Harris notes that writers have explored spirituality–nature connections for decades, yet this large body of work has had little visible impact on actual nature connectedness.
* He argues the press only became interested because the Derby work is statistical and therefore coded as more “scientific,” even though the study found higher nature connection in societies that prioritise faith over science. 
* The key question is what drives behavioural change: environmental campaigns have relied on facts and data, but these have not significantly shifted behaviour.
* Harris claims experiences matter more than facts for changing attitudes and practices, using the example of Blue Planet II – viewers seeing animals harmed by plastic prompted a stronger shift than abstract information about plastic pollution. 
* He foregrounds “embodied knowing” – it is not what you know, but how you know – arguing that lived, embodied experience can reshape our underlying patterns more effectively than cognitive facts, which are often forgotten or assimilated to existing worldviews.
* Conclusion: if you want theory and data on spirituality and nature connection, go to the library; if you want to cultivate it, go to the woods and have direct experience.
