# # technopoly trains our desires

## Highlights

> Technopoly tells us that we own ourselves, and that everything we need to fulfill our own (unchallengeable) desires is available for sale in the marketplace.

> And the greatest instruments ever devised for such channeling are our internet-connected devices, especially when we connect to the internet through *apps*. The reason?

> In short: in relation to the Grand Strategy of Technopoly, *the essential purpose* of apps is to eliminate the sphere of the tactical. It is to make the kind of improvisation I celebrated in my essay on Albert Murray impossible.
