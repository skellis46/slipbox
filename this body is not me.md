# this body is not me

_previous note:_ [[boundaries between ourselves and others]]

> When we practice the Third Prostration, we touch deeply the world of no-birth and no-death, the world or nirvana here and now, the kingdom of God. "This body is not me. I am not caught in this body. I am life without boundaries." I am not caught in the ideas of being and nonbeing, birth and death. I fully recognize myself in all my ancestors and all my children, and in the trees and flowers that are standing in front of me.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.179]
