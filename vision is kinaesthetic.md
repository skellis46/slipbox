# vision is kinaesthetic

_previous note:_  [[without symbolic mediation]]

---

Barker cites (on p.2) the American psychologist James J. Gibson (actually, she cites him through an incorrectly referenced article by Anne Rutherford -- 2003 and _not_ 2002):

> vision is kinaesthetic in that it registers movements of the body just as much as does the muscle-joint-skin system and the inner-ear system.

-- J. J. Gibson (1979) _The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception_ (p.183), cited in <http://sensesofcinema.com/2003/feature-articles/embodied_affect/>

This is an important idea because in dance and somatic practices we often attempt to reduce the impact or value of vision because it such a dominant way of living kinaesthetic lives.
