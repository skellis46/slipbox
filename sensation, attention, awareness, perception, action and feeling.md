# sensation, attention, awareness, perception, action and feeling

_previous note:_ [[Seth - Being You]]

My hunch in dance is that we say 'sensation' when we mean perception. We humans are not privy to sensory signals. See [[perceptions and sensory signals]].

In [[paying attention]] Kabat-Zin distinguishes between paying attention and awareness (specifically that we get more aware by paying attention)

Do I need to add consciousness and experience to this list of things to disambiguate? See [[there is no boundary between awareness of experience and experience itself]]

Regarding paying attention see [[predictive processing vs controlled hallucination#^2849f3]] -- turning up the gain on proprioception, interoception.

- [[attending to an object that does not change]]

- Attention is attempt to narrow the field of consciousness (Harris) 
- attention and volition (act of will) ... attention can be guided by volition (inside and outside body)

> When trying to form perceptions, all the brain has to go on is a constant barrage of electrical signals which are only indirectly related to things out there in the world, whatever 76they may be.[@seth-2021-being Loc 1283] 

- "On the controlled hallucination view, the purpose of perception is to guide action and behaviour – to promote the organism’s prospects of survival. We perceive the world not as it is, but as it is useful for us." - [[Seth - Being You#^690ef9]]

- [[Bayes and abductive reasoning]]

> Perception and action are so tightly coupled that they determine and define each other. Every action alters perception by changing the incoming sensory data, and every perception is the way it is in order to help guide action. There is simply no point to perception in the absence of action. We perceive the world around us in order to act effectively within it, to achieve our goals and – in the long run – to promote our prospects of survival. We don’t perceive the world as it is, we perceive it as it is useful for us to do so. [@seth-2021-being Loc 1817]


> It may even be that action comes first. Instead of picturing the brain as reaching perceptual best guesses in order to then guide behaviour, we can think of brains as fundamentally in the business of generating actions, and continually calibrating these 112actions using sensory signals, so as to best achieve the organism’s goals. This view casts the brain as an intrinsically dynamic, active system, continually probing its environment and examining the consequences. [@seth-2021-being Loc 1821]

> In the long run, actions are fundamental to learning – which here means improving the brain’s generative models by revealing more 114about the causes of sensory signals, and about the causal structure of the world in general. [@seth-2021-being Loc 1849]

> We probably don’t think much about proprioception because, in some sense, it’s always there, but the simple fact that you can touch your nose with your eyes shut – try it! – demonstrates the essential role it plays in all our actions. From the perspective of active inference, touching my nose means allowing a suite of proprioceptive predictions about hand movement and position to become self-fulfilling – to overwhelm the sensory evidence that my fingers are currently not touching my nose. Precision weighting again plays an important role here. In order for proprioceptive predictions to make themselves come true, the prediction errors that are telling the brain where the body actually is must be attenuated, or down-weighted. This can be thought of as the opposite of 115paying attention – a kind of ‘disattention’ to the body, which allows it to move. [@seth-2021-being Loc 1860]

- above re [[losing oneself]] (noting also on 20240312 that I need a bit more context/understanding re attenuating prediction errors)

> Thinking about action in this way underlines how action and perception are two sides of the same coin. Rather than perception being the input and action being the output with respect to some central ‘mind’, action and perception are both forms of brain-based prediction. Both depend on a common process of Bayesian best guessing, on a carefully choreographed dance between perceptual predictions and sensory prediction errors, just with differences in who leads and who follows.[@seth-2021-being Loc 1867]

> disattention: This idea can be experimentally tested, and it indeed turns out that during action, proprioceptive sensory sensitivity is reduced, just as would be expected (C. E. Palmer et al., 2016). The sensory attenuation accompanying action also provides a neat explanation for why we can’t tickle ourselves (H. Brown et al., 2013). [@seth-2021-being Loc 1946]

> In cognitive science, the phenomenology of objecthood has been most thoroughly explored by ‘sensorimotor contingency theory’. According to this theory, what we experience depends on a ‘practical mastery’ of how actions change sensory inputs. When we perceive something, the content of what we perceive is not carried by the sensory signals; instead it emerges from the 129brain’s implicit knowledge about how actions and sensations are coupled. On this view, vision – and all our perceptual modalities – are things an organism does, not passive information feeds for a centralised ‘mind’. [@seth-2021-being Loc 2114]

- "how actions change sensory inputs" is fascinating. This touches on that feed-forward kind of loop in improvising -- that movement changes sensory inputs. The perceptual modalities of [[interoception]] and [[proprioception]] (both perceiving movement on the inside) are what we do (not information feeds). That is, perception emerges from my brain's "implicit knowledge about how actions and sensations are coupled".
