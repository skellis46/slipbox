# strathern's law

_previous note:_ [[to fit the way we measure it]]

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

One way in which this can occur is individuals trying to anticipate the effect of a [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy "Policy") and then taking actions that alter its outcome.

Generalized from Goodhart's Law: "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes."

> As soon as we try to manipulate behaviors to alter a measure, it’s no longer useful.
> That’s why you can’t believe social media metrics. Because they don’t measure anything except whether someone is good at making them go up.
