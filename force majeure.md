# force majeure

_previous note:_ [[dance after lockdown public facing report]]

In the early months of 2021 I worked with my colleagues [Rosa Cisneros](https://rosasencis.org) and [Rowan McLelland](https://www.rambertschool.org.uk/alumni/rowan-mclelland/) on a small research project called [Dance after Lockdown](https://danceafterlockdown.coventry.ac.uk). It was pretty simple stuff: Rowan had conversations with a number of dance artists and administrators about their experiences of the first national lockdown here in the UK and then we reported on these conversations. 

We also thought one way to increase access to the research might be to create a film that builds on some of the ideas the participants shared with us in the conversations. I'd long wanted to work with the animator [Magali Charrier](https://www.magalicharrier.com) and so she and I made a four-minute animation called _Force Majeure_. The film is built on a script that draws on the participants' ideas and experiences and places them into the voice of a made-up freelance dance artist called Selina.

Here it is.
