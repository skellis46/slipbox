# chores and initiative

_previous note:_ [[Burkeman - Four thousand weeks]]

> When I’m clearing my inbox, responding to comments in a doc, cooking lunch–these are chores.
> Chores are the backbone of industrial productivity. We can check them off, measure them and see them stacked up.
> Most of the time, most of us do chores. Finding a way to do your chores more productively is quite leveraged, and you can put it to use right away.
> The other hat, though, looks very different.
> This is the hat of initiative.
> Finding a new problem to solve.
> Looking for new tools.
> Asking questions when we’re not sure there’s even an answer.
> Launching a new project that might not work.
> When staring into the bottomless hole of initiative, chores are tempting. Because they put us back on firm footing.
> Neil Gaiman has a simple solution for writer’s block: He puts himself into a room where there are absolutely no chores to do. No sites to check, no emails to answer. Nothing productive is available except for initiative.
> It’s hard to wear two hats at once. [@godin-2024-pw1]
