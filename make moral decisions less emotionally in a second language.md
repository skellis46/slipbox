# make moral decisions less emotionally in a second language

_previous note:_ [[boundaries and transgressions]] (thinking about distance created by non-native language)

> It appears that speaking in a nonnative language can provide a sense of distance from a problem that leads individuals to make moral decisions less emotionally.
