# your body is an ancestor

_previous note:_ [[rituals are architectures of time]]

> So in the essay, '[Your Body is an Ancestor](https://braidedway.org/your-body-is-an-ancestor/)’, what I was thinking about is that we don’t need to create rituals. Our body is a ritual, our cells are a product of anarchic queer lovemaking whereby mitochondria and ancient prokaryotes fused to create the cells that build our bodies today. We are the product of these fusions.[Strand, in @ducann-2022-my n.pag.]

- [[footfall]]
- [[ancestors provide the range of what it is to be human]]
- [[a continuation of our ancestors]]
