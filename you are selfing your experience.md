# you are selfing your experience

_previous note:_ [[Harris - Ego and illusion]]

01:29  
> ... your mental experience of the world is a process. It is not a static something. So the experience of being a self, an ego, in the middle of all of these changing neurophysiological states, it too must be a process. It's a verb, it's not a noun. You are selfing your experience. You are not a self standing in the middle of experience. Self is a kind of action. It's the act of identifying. It's the act of grasping. [@harris-nodate-ego 01:29min]

- the clarity of this is astonishing and valuable for [[losing oneself]]
- it also marks a clear line in [[flow]] conditions between the loss of self to the construction or action of selfing (and in which the flow _state_ is gone).
- [[self-consciousness, flow and nonduality]]
