# body actions change sensory data

_previous note:_ [[Seth - Being You]]

> Any kind of bodily action will change sensory data in some way, whether it’s moving your eyes, walking into a different room, or tightening your stomach muscles. Even high-level ‘actions’, like applying for a new job or deciding to get married, will cascade down into sets of bodily actions which alter sensory inputs. [@seth-2021-being Location 1834]

- in [[embodied intelligence project]] am thinking here that even the practice of 'dropping into the body' makes something else possible -- that new sensory data are afforded as a consequence. And to be clear, this 'dropping into the senses of the body' happens all the time in somatically trained people.
- this would be fascinating research: how often do you remember your body? (or drop into it?) -- during the day.
