# a stable sense of self is rooted in the lungs, heart and gut

_previous note:_ [[consciousness as a full-body phenomenon]]

"Your consciousness really does have deep, rich roots in your bodily feelings."[@monti-2021-stable n.pag.]

Alessandro Monti is a researcher at the Social and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of Rome. He outlines his work in an article for Psyche called _A stable sense of self is rooted in the lungs, heart and gut_. It is written for a more general audience. 

The central premise of Monti's research is to understand links between bodily feelings and consciousness. 

> With the exception of dreaming and altered states of mind, all conscious experiences entail this subtle but pervasive feeling of bodily self-consciousness. But where does it come from? The feeling cannot merely stem from the outward look of the body, because you could spend a great deal of time and money to change your appearance without feeling like a different self (no matter how hard hairdressers and designers try to convince you otherwise). Rather, the bodily basis of your stable self must spring from a steadier source. And since the body is felt not just from without, but also from within, your internal organs could be one such source.[@monti-2021-stable n.pag.]

He writes how visceral organs go through regular patterns and cycles (as part of their homeostatic functioning) and information from these cycles is sent from peripheral nerves (particularly through the vagus nerve) to the central nervous system. The CNS synchronises with cardiac, respiratory and gastric fluctuations.

> Everything changes around you, but your internal organs are always there, always broadcasting signals to the brain, always playing their thorough bass in the grand music of life. The inner side of the body is the only object that you cannot stop receiving information about, the only object you always feel from the beginning to the end of your days. Thus, internal organs are a prime candidate as a basis for building and maintaining your sense of selfhood across time.[@monti-2021-stable n.pag.]

In the article Monti outlines the experiments they have done to establish some correlations between cardiac, respiratory and gastric cycles and one's sense of self. In one they created an illusion of embodiment based on breathing that they called [[embreathment]].

The article contains a large number of links to original research.
