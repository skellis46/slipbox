# we can know more than we can tell

_previous note:_ [[embodied intelligence project]]

> It is a fact, declared Michael Polanyi, introducing a series of lectures on _The Tacit Dimension_, ‘that we can know more than we can tell’ (Polanyi 1966: 4). Polanyi was referring to those ways of knowing and doing that grow through the experience and practice of a craft, but which adhere so closely to the person of the practitioner as to remain out of reach of explication or analysis. His argument was that knowledge of the sort that can be rendered formally and self-consciously explicit is but the tip of an iceberg compared with the immense reservoir of know-how that lies beneath the surface and without which nothing could be practicably accomplished. Whereas Polanyi, however, was primarily interested in what it means to know, my concern just now is with what it means to tell. [@ingold-2013-making Location 2422]
