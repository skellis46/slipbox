# alive or dead? I'm not saying

_previous note:_ [[not knowing and surprise]]

This is a koan:

> Daowu and Jianyuan went to a house to offer condolences. Jianyuan struck the coffin with his hand and asked, “Alive or dead?”
> Daowu said, “I’m not saying alive, I’m not saying dead.”
> Jianyuan asked, “Why not?”
> Daowu said, “I’m not saying! I’m not saying!”
> On the way home, Jianyuan said, “Say something right now, Teacher. If you don’t, I’m going to hit you.”
> Daowu said, “You can hit me, but even if you hit me, I’m not saying.” Jianyuan hit him.
> After Daowu passed away, Jianyuan went to Shishuang and told him this story.
> Shishuang said, “I’m not saying alive, I’m not saying dead.”
> Jianyuan asked, “Why not?”
> Shishuang said, “I’m not saying! I’m not saying!”
> At these words Jianyuan had an insight.

There are so many lessons in this Koan. The response to any question, "I'm not saying it's this, I'm not saying it's not" conveys a sense of humility and open-mindedness. It touches on the deep ambivalence I feel between certainty and uncertainty, and about the conditions under which I might say something (anything at all, but particularly in dance practice research). And the beauty of its humour.

> In this koan, the teacher helps the student by refusing to give the kind of help he is being asked for. This refusal is an example of what psychologists call holding a container for change, and the teacher got clobbered for it, which you will probably think is only fair if anyone has ever helped you in such a manner. The teacher’s not saying, though, turns out to be a tool for the student to get through the impasse, surprising everyone. The ancient way of working with the koan is to carry the question with you wherever you go.[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 5 A Condolence Call: Pursuing Death Into Life, n.pag.]
