# schwab - experiment! towards an artistic epistemology

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experimental systems]]

---

In this article Michael Schwab proposes "a post-conceptual understanding of experimental systems as the foundation for an artistic epistemology."[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.129] He draws on the work of science historian Hans-Jörg Rheinberger, sociologist Steven Shapin, and art historian Herbert Molderings' analysis of Duchamp. His reading of Molderings in particular is close, and includes a brief history and development of the concept of experimentation in art.

_thoughts & links:_

- I created satellite notes for this chapter as follows:
- [[virtual witnessing]]
- [[epistemic things are vague]]
- [[experimentation is social]]
- [[artistic epistemology and radical individuality]]
- [[epistemic things, technical objects and Duchamp]]
- Note that Schwab himself is not sure of when Rheinberger first started being discussed in relation to practice-research. He says:

>I am not 100% sure about this. I know of Rheinberger through Hannes Rickli’s work <https://www.zhdk.ch/person/prof-hannes-rickli-6486> –  Rheinberger has been collaborating with Rickli’s team over the years. Before this, I don’t know.[^pers]

- still very unsure or skeptical about Schwab's clarity as a writer. It's unnecessarily loopy and dense.
- seems as if this writing is a slightly earlier attempt to justify or make sense of an artistic epistemology through describing -- or re-contextualising -- Rheinberger's thinking about experimentation. As such it's a bit loose or ill-formed, or perhaps unconvincing.
- I wonder what my skepticism is about. That is, what is that I'm resisting about Schwab's theorisation here? 
- note Hannes Rickli's work in Intellectual Birdhouse: [mareis-2011-intellectual.pdf](hook://file/x1np3krPS?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=mareis-2011-intellectual.pdf)
