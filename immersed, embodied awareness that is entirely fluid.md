# immersed, embodied awareness that is entirely fluid

_previous note:_ [[Kelly - Meditation vs Flow States]]

> expert consciousness is nondual. The expert is not conscious of his or her own subjectivity and its relation to the object with which he or she is engaged, or even of the tools the expert might be using, including his or her own body. That is the kind of novice awareness that just gets in the way. Instead, the focused attention of the expert is entirely on the task at hand and on the goals to be accomplished through that task. It is immersed, embodied awareness, and awareness that is entirely fluid, adjusting to the ever-changing demands of the task at hand. Nothing resembling a self is ever present in this kind of consciousness. This is the sense in which actors or dancers, when they are successful, completely *inhabit* their roles, becoming the roles they embody, instead of experiencing *themselves* as performing those roles.
