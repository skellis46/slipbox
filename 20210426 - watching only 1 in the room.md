# 20210426 - watching only 1 in the room

This is a series of short experiments made by [Ajani Brannum](https://www.barryabrannum.com/) around 2015. When I watched them (during the first lockdown in the northern spring of 2020) I thought they were created in response to being isolated. This is not the case.

I was particularly struck by the first test, and of the surprise of the camera as a kind of ball -- and my ongoing uncertainty about how it was made or achieved. (I still don't know after a year since I first watched it).

I'm drawn to the everydayness of them, the weirdness, their homemadeness, how pithy they are, the sense of experimentation, their playfulness and how they contain surprise. 

I don't imagine what I'm making will hand onto a similar quality of being unfinished, but I've certainly been influenced by the role of the camera, and the solitude of the performer-operator.
