# technics as a process of exteriorization

_previous note:_ [[technics, techne, and technology]]

Because I haven't read Stiegler or Mumford in any detail I include this summary from posthuman scholar Judy Ehrentraut's blog [The Simulation Space](https://thesimulationspace.wordpress.com): 

> **Technics:** first used by Lewis Mumford, defined as the human tendency to control and direct forces of nature. Stiegler uses it to describe a process of the exteriorization of the human through extensions such as prosthesis. The exteriorization of memory has to do with technologies of information and the industrialization of memory.[@ehrentraut-2014-bernard n.pag.]

- [[we access time through objects or artifacts]]
- Mumford text is _Technics and Civilization_
- industrialization of memory is a powerful concept
- what is relationship between Stiegler and Mumford?
