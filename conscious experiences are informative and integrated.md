# conscious experiences are informative and integrated

_previous note:_ [[Seth - Being You]]

- [[consciousness as a full-body phenomenon]]

> An important consequence of taking multidimensional levels of consciousness seriously is that sharp distinctions between conscious level and conscious content disappear. It becomes meaningless to completely separate how conscious you are from what you are conscious of. A ‘one size fits all’ measure of consciousness – of 48the sort we might expect if we take the temperature analogy too literally – may never be enough. (Location 797)[@seth-2021-being n.pag.]

> Tononi and Edelman asked what was characteristic about conscious experiences in general. They made a simple but profound observation: that conscious experiences – all conscious experiences – are both informative and integrated. From this starting point, they made claims about the neural basis of every conscious experience, not just of specific experiences of seeing red, or feeling jealous, or suffering a toothache. (Location 865)

> Conscious experiences are 53informative because every conscious experience is different from every other conscious experience that you have ever had, ever will have, or ever could have. (Location 871)

> On this view, the ‘what-it-is-like-ness’ of any specific conscious experience is defined not so much by what it is, but by all the unrealised but possible things that it is not. An experience of pure redness is the way that it is, not because of any intrinsic property of ‘redness’, but because red is not blue, green, or any other colour, or any smell, or a thought or a feeling of regret or indeed any other form of mental content whatsoever. Redness is redness because of all the things it isn’t, and the same goes for all other conscious experiences. (Location 882)

> Conscious experiences are not only highly informative, they are also integrated. Exactly what is meant by consciousness being ‘integrated’ is still much debated, but essentially it means that every conscious experience appears as a unified scene. We do not experience colours separately from their shapes, nor objects independently of their background. (Location 887)

> The key move made by Tononi and Edelman was to propose that if every conscious experience is both informative and unified at the level of phenomenology, then the neural mechanisms underlying conscious experiences should also exhibit both of these properties. That it is in virtue of expressing both of these properties that neural mechanisms do not merely correlate with, but actually account for, core phenomenological features of every conscious experience. (Location 892)

This is known as IIT (informative-integrated-theory??). Seth then goes on to talk about IIT about phi:

> At the core of IIT is a single measure called ‘Φ’ (the Greek letter phi, pronounced fy). The easiest way to think about Φ is that it measures how much a system is ‘more than the sum’ of its parts, in terms of information. (Location 1054)
