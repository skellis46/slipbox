# doxa and habitus

In _Wokeness and Myth on Campus_ Alan Jacobs describes the phenomena of doxa, habitus, orthodoxy, heterodoxy and heresy. Here's the quote at length:

>We might further explore this kind of response by appealing to the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of _habitus_. _Habitus_ includes the set of beliefs (_doxa_) that govern the structure of a culture while remaining utterly implicit. These beliefs yield embodied practices, which “express a logic that is performed directly....without recourse to concepts.” Within the ambit of _doxa_, “the natural and social world appears as self-evident.” One’s _habitus_ is, then, the whole field of practices that one enacts, only occasionally becoming aware of the _doxa_ to which those practices are so intimately related. Indeed, one becomes aware of those _doxa_ only when something calls them into question. When circumstances—usually the appearance of an alien culture—force those beliefs into explicit formulation, then we have not just _doxa_ but _orthodoxy_. Orthodoxy, in turn, necessarily implies the possibility of _heterodoxy_ or heresy. The formulation of orthodoxy, which arises from the actual or even the merely possible violation of _doxa_, constitutes a profound disturbance of one’s _habitus_.[@jacobs_wokeness_2017 p.38]

Jacobs cites the work of Mary Douglas -- _Purity and Danger_ -- in relation to ritual:

>Douglas again: “Ritual recognises the potency of disorder.” The purpose of such rituals for those new to the community is to transform explicitly held belief into undisturbable _doxa_—to restore the absolute security of the _habitus_.

_thoughts & links:_

- I wonder what the doxa of #practice-research are? 
- see also Ingold's [[fields of practice]] not least because Jacobs uses that precise term
