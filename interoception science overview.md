# interoception

_This note pulls together various bits and pieces of information about interoception. Mostly from Mehling but also Christensen's introduction to their research._

Mehling writes how interoception can be narrowly and broadly defined. Narrowly, it can be defined as "the perception of physical sensations from inside the body and includes sensations related to internal organ function, such as heartbeat, respiration, satiety, and autonomic nervous system activity related to emotions"[@mehling-2020-if p.255]. 

Broadly, Mehling defines it as "any perception that originates inside the body."[@mehling-2020-if p.255]

> interoception has been suggested as a key perceptual system for consciousness and self-awareness (Craig, 2002, 2003; Critchley, Wiens, Rotshtein, Ohman, & Dolan, 2004; Tajadura-Jimenez & Tsakiris, 2014).[@christensen-2018-can p.1]

- noting here that interoception is (rather obviously) a _perceptual system_.

Mehling links to primary research on interoception (narrowly and broadly defined) and notes how research on interoception in the last decade has exploded.

Note also the distinction between three main dimensions (in empirical tradition): 
- interoceptive accuracy (sensitivity, IAcc); "objective accuracy of perceiving bodily signals, e.g., heart rate [HR], gastric activity"[@christensen-2018-can p.1]
- interoceptive awareness (sensibility).[@mehling-2020-if p.255]; "self-rated tendency to focus on internal bodily signals as reported on questionnaires"[@christensen-2018-can p.1]
- interoceptive awareness; metacognitive awareness of IAcc, receiver operating characteristic [ROC][@christensen-2018-can p.2] (**Note that Mehling is less convinced by clarity of term metacognitive awareness: 10.1098/rstb.2016.0013.**)

Three dimensions are commonly uncorrelated (!). This is a very important _problem_ for [[somatics unlimited]]

Christensen et al. describe interoception as "the process of perceiving afferent signals arising from within the body including heart rate (HR), gastric signals, etc., and has been described as a mechanism crucially involved in the creation of self-awareness and selfhood."[@christensen-2018-can p.1]

*What follows is material from the wikipedia page (note obvious and important distinction between conscious and unconscious sense):*

Interoception is the conscious or unconscious sense of the internal state of the body. It relates to physiological tissues that send information to the central nervous system about the state of the body. These tissues or pathways are: 

1. the laminaI spinothalamic pathway
2. the classical viscerosensory pathway
3. the vagus nerve and glossopharyngeal nerve
4. chemosensory pathways in the blood
5. somatosensory pathways from the skin

>The somatosensory pathway relays information about [[proprioception]] and discriminative touch to the brain through different receptors in the skin.[@noauthor-2020-interoception n.pag.]

_questions & thoughts:_

- when it comes to the skin in 5. the line between exteroception and interoception is not so clear to me.
