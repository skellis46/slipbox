# Somatics Unlimited

[down]

_previous note:_ [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]

![[somatics unlimited map.canvas]]

## The things we say

Here are four claims made on behalf of somatics and drawn from the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices.

[right]

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

[right]

> [Eye contact in Authentic movement] can communicate so many feelings as well as compassion or empathy; it enables a direct meeting from the depths of the souls, without words. [@halstrup-2015-bones p.290]

[right]

> By adopting a somatic approach to conducting research, writing, creating art, or engaging in another profession, we become more alive to what touches us and how our work and presence can touch others. [@saumaa-2020-somaticist p.237]

## Making claims

- see also later in Nordquist about how a claim is different from opinion

What does it mean to _claim_ something? 

A "claim is something which someone says which they cannot prove and which may be false" [@noauthor-nodate-claim]. To claim something is also to "assert and demand recognition" or possession of something. And when we say someone claims something, we suggest doubt [@noauthor-nodate-claim]. 

What a claim is not is an argument.

[down]

> Claims backed by reasons that are supported by evidence are called arguments. [@nordquist-2020-what n.pag.]

A claim without evidence is simply an opinion or _assertion_. 

[down - blank]

I have used the word _claim_ because while reading JDSP over the years I thought I was seeing a tendency or pattern -- a pattern of unsubstantiated assertions about the value and currency of somatic practices: as if somatics has unlimited value, scope, and power to produce postiive change.   

In doing this work I do not seek to shame our field or tear it down. If anything, I see myself as a believer in the transformative powers of somatic practices: I have experienced their benefits, and continue to practice a version of authentic movement as an anchor to my understanding of movement, sensation and consciousness. Rather, I want to understand the epistemic values and costs of somatic practices as represented by the materials published in JDSP. And I hope I do this in a way that is constructive, generative and provocative. 

[down]

## An unfinished catalogue of claims

Late last year, I started something that I have not yet finished. I started cataloguing every claim made on behalf of somatic practices in the journal. 

I haven't yet finished this cataloguing effort because I ran out of time. In fact, I didn't get close. Up to Volume 14.2 in 2022, 272 articles have been published in JDSP. This number excludes editorials, reports, book reviews and volume 14.1S, but includes interviews and editorials for special issues. To this date I have only worked through 85 of these 272, which is just shy of a third. [down] [down]

My observations today have emerged from working with the JDSP archive.

[down]

## A note on cherry picking

Human beings are cherry pickers. We seek and notice examples that confirm our beliefs or ideas and don't notice or ignore examples that contradict these beliefs. Such confirmation biases are not conscious. For example, goal-oriented motivated reasoning is driven by personal emotions. That is, the heuristic for judging new information is, more or less: how does this information make me feel? 

In this presentation I have tried to mitigate against cherry picking. I did this by randomly selecting 20 articles from the full 272 and then worked my way down that list of 20 articles to include as examples in this presentation. For example, I drew the quote-claims I presented at the beginning from the first four randomly selected articles. This randomised process also reveals just how common the following observations are in the JDSP corpus. 

[down]

add how these quotes are plucked from context and in that sense it is unfair -- or something like this. 

## Six observations

[down]

### 1. Abstractions

[right - auto] Most of the extraordinary number of practices presented in JDSP are described in ways that would be difficult to recognise for those not already in the know. Their descriptions contain abstractions that are easily taken for granted. 

Here's an example pulled from article 81 of 272, and it's about building an artist book as a form of tactile writing: [right] 

> [the artist book] was an attempt to embody – through ‘written’ archiving – the intersensorial metatext of a performance that was pregnant with tactile intention [@bonenfant-2013-writing p.122].

Note the abstractions. What is intersensorial metatext? And how might it be embodied? What is a tactile intention and how does it get pregnant? 

[right - blank]

Perhaps though the poetics of abstract language are a feature and not a bug? My sense is that there is tremendous value to continue to develop the poetics of the field and the ways in which both poetic and scholarly abstractions might strengthen or embolden academic understandings. Yet I also worry that with abstractions come dangers. Who and what might we be exploiting through deploying abstractions, even if the exploitation is of an epistemic space? 

[right]

### 2. Mechanisms are as rare as hens' teeth

I catalogued whether articles contained any description of the mechanism for the beneficial claims made on behalf of each somatic practice. In other words, did the articles describe _how_ the benefits happen? Few articles in JDSP seem to do this: about one in five of the 85 I analysed. In most cases, the practice (or practices) are implicitly also the mechanism: somatic practice x can lead to effect y due to the somatic practice process x. 

When articles do contain mechanisms it's mostly difficult to ascertain if the mechanisms have anything to do with the somatic practice linked to the claim. 

Here's randomly selected article 246 from the 272 from which I have drawn an example. In it, I labelled the somatic practice as _Phylogenetic mask work_ which I appreciate is not your run-of-the-mill somatic practice. The author claims that this mask work:

[down]

> can help us to overcome a human/nature alienation and instead create connection [@wright-2021-using p.203].

The author indicates that it is the animal and nature modes of sensing that are _how_ the mask work helps us to overcome human/nature alienation. 

I have lots of questions here, not least how it is that we would know if this mechanism was doing its work, or (more usefully) how would we know if it were not? 

[down - blank]

Why does this matter? The question '_How_ does this practice do this?' is monumental. Without this question our claims are flimsy. They remain simply claims. Perhaps though the lack of 'mechanisms' is not surprising. These are (by and large) not the kinds of methods we adopt in our work.  

As an aside, in the 85 articles I analysed in detail I read no claims that indicated some negative effect or outcome because of a somatic practice. I remember one incident during an Awareness Through Movement class when a first time student had a destructive experience based on the assumptions the teacher was making about sight and sightedness. Where are those more inconvenient anecdotes in our journal? 

[right]

### 3. Patchwork quilt

I observed that the articles in the journal are mostly individual cells of information that present their own ideas independently of other practices and debates in the field (including the journal itself). It is as if we are -- through the journal -- creating the start of a patchwork quilt in which the various (and different) pieces are waiting to be stitched together, or rather are roughly held together by the acronym JDSP. 

In this waiting to be stitched together I suspect there is enormous potential to build the scholarly process of sewing these patches together. To draw lines and links between ideas, claims, practices and experiences. To start stronger and more enduring dialogues and debates within the field.

[right]

### 4. Descriptions of practice

The articles that most commonly do NOT make claims are those that are simple descriptions or presentations of practice. It would seem that one vital part of the Journal's role is as a place to share current practices. I'll note though -- and this is a particular bugbear of mine [see @ellis-forthcoming-ecosystemic] -- that rarely are these descriptions of practice drawn into dialogue with other similar or overlapping practices. They are more or less isolated bubbles of practice which likewise contribute to the patchwork effect I have just discussed. 

[down]

### 5. Arguing from authority

When I began this work I assumed that the claims made for somatics would veer towards being claims (or appeals) to authority. The fallacy of _appeal to authority_ is when "a claim is supported by reference to an authority instead of offering reasons to support it" [@novaes-2021-argument n.pag.] These are akin to what Isabelle Ginot -- in her landmark critique of somatic practices in 2010 -- described as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]. 

But I was surprised. Of the 85 articles I analysed, about two-thirds made what I called primary claims. That is, a claim that makes no reference to research or scholarship by other people (it is uncited or assumed) and/or is based on the practices described in the article.

Yet perhaps in hindsight this is not so surprising. These primary claims align with the patchwork I have just described. They are primary claims that are placed into the aether of somatics practices discourses, and rarely, if ever, support, interrupt, change or unsettle the practices (and their epistemic underpinnings) already presented in the journal. 

If we look at citation patterns for all articles in JDSP it starts to make the patchwork picture of primary claims very stark indeed. I have zero interest in the quantitative crudeness of citation indices: "Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's accurate. Or that it matters" [@godin-2023-song n.pag.]. The number of citations is not necessarily correlated to the quality or reliability of research; however it is a rough estimate of the influence of an article (whether positive or negative).

Here then are the number of times five randomly drawn articles from all 272 JDSP articles have been cited.

[right]

- Angharad Harrop [-@harrop-2014-can] _I can feel his heart beating through the sole of my foot: Reflections on improvisation from a dancer finding her feet_: cited 3 times   

[right]

- Claire Loussouarn [-@loussouarn-2021-this] _This urban wild field in Hackney Marshes_: cited 0 times    

[right]

- Carol Marie Webster [-@webster-2019-chat] _Chat to Mi Back: Meditation on body archive_: cited 0 times  

[right]

- Leonardo José Sebiane Serrano [-@sebianeserrano-2020-mestizoa] _Mestizo Corporalities: Tropical/vibrant Latin American bodies_: cited 2 times  

[right]

- Carol Brown [-@brown-2017-entangled] _Entangled histories, part 1: Releasing the Archive_: cited 4 times (including one self-citation).

[right - blank]

There most cited articles in JDSP (according to Intellect) start high but then drop off. These numbers are

[right]

- 434 [@eddy-2009-brief]  
- 73 [@caldwell-2013-pilates]
- 71 [@fortin-2009-experience]
- 51 [@greenhead-2015-touch]
- 49 [@williamson-2010-reflections] 
- 48 [@williamson-2009-formative]
- 42 [@batson-2012-integrating]
- 25 [@ravn-2010-sensing]
- 21 [@smith-2014-pedagogy]
- 15 [@little-2014-restructuring]

The Scopus database has an incomplete dataset of JDSP that misses the first five years of the journal. But from 2014-2022 Scopus contains 197 JDSP articles, and of these, 13 have 2 citations, 45 have 1 citation, and 105 have 0 citations.


These numbers might say something about the relative size of our field, but the raw numbers also indicate that we are not engaging in debates within the field. If there were such debates these numbers would be higher, and I think the field would be richer for it.

The field would be richer because when we make an academic claim (a claim you make in an argument) it is "considered debatable or up for inquiry" [@nordquist-2020-what n.pag]. Through debate we make dissent possible, and a research field is only as strong as what it allows to be questioned. When asked how to minimise the impact of cognitive biases in human debate, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman said, "protect the dissenters" [@parrish-2020-daniel] by making dissent painless.

Here's Australian philosopher Peter Ellerton: 

[right]

> That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry. [@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

I'm curious about this phrase _epistemic credibility_. Without the kind of process that Ellerton describes then I worry that we end up in some kind of [right] vicious circle of epistemological impoverishment in which there are no limits to the claims made on behalf of somatic practices, which means there are no grounds to debate such claims, which means there are no limits to the claims, etc.

[down]

### 6. Doing the can-can

This last observation is about the word _can_. I'll use the next two articles drawn randomly from all 272 articles. 

[right]

> This prerogative of the visual can be seen in everyday life, when ‘seeing’ is equated to ‘understanding’ [@grau-2011-dancing p.9]

And here's another (also drawn at random):

[right]

> focusing on the micro-political body through somatic education can help women exercise agency within the matrix of social inequalities they live in. [Fortin 2015, in @fortin-2018-fibromyalgia p.271]

In both quotes, the word _can_ is the same as the term "to be able to". But the stakes of this second article's _can_ are high. This _can_ is implicated in a claim about a benefit of somatic practices: somatic practice x CAN lead to effect y. Once you start seeing the word _can_ used in this way in JDSP you see it everywhere. Perhaps this is a case of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (also called the frequency illusion) -- that thing that happens when you learn a word or idea and then start seeing it everywhere -- but my suspicion is that we in JDSP deploy the word _can_ as a _hedge_ very often indeed. 

Let's take another look at the claims I presented at the beginning. Remember, these were from the first four articles I drew at random from all 272 articles in JDSP: 

[right]

> Embodied perspectives can enrich traditional theories and approaches [Meier et al 2012, in @petsilas-2019-embodied p.182]

[right]

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

[right]

> [Eye contact in Authentic movement] can communicate so many feelings as well as compassion or empathy; it enables a direct meeting from the depths of the souls, without words. [@halstrup-2015-bones p.290]

[right]

> By adopting a somatic approach to conducting research, writing, creating art, or engaging in another profession, we become more alive to what touches us and how our work and presence can touch others. [@saumaa-2020-somaticist p.237]

Why does this _can_ matter? It matters because how does anyone refute such a _can_? Yes, somatic practice X can produce effect y, but it's so loose. Under what conditions? When does it NOT produce such an effect? The _can_ inadvertently serves as a way to reduce the possibility of argument or refutation. Or perhaps, more positively, it is a form of epistemic humility; of not wanting to make strong assertions. 

Just to note that this last _can_ in article 222 is more akin to the way article 37 used the word: "This prerogative of the visual can be seen in everyday life" [@grau-2011-dancing p.9]). This _can_ you see here is less like a hedged claim. And what is striking about it is that, without the slipperiness of the word _can_ as part of the direct claim, it becomes a bolder assertion [right] highlighted by the phrase "we become". Perhaps such boldness opens and creates more space for debate. 

[right]

## Four brief limitations to finish

[down]

### 1. Feeling uncertain and the cost of being right or wrong

How certain do I feel that these various observations show systemic problems in somatics? Clearly my evidence is partial, and not nearly as rigorous as I would have liked it to be. I also think I set about looking for these kinds of issues. I am more contrary than I'd like to imagine myself to be, and I did not start out with neutral eyes. But even given those caveats, this work I have presented (with analysis of nearly one-third of all articles presented in JDSP) is also not nothing. The epistemic exit polls don't look good for us. 

I think a version of Pascal's wager based on probability theory is useful here. Pascal proposed that "humans bet with their lives that God either exists or does not" [@noauthor-2020-pascal n.pag.], and that the rationale thing would be to bet that God exists. If you are right you get all the trappings of the good life after death, but if you are wrong you lose little if anything. 

In our case (and this is a slight twist) the cost of my being right far exceeds the cost of my being wrong. If I am wrong but we still enter the debates, continue to challenge the claims we make etc, then I think somatics scholarship and epistemology is strengthened. But if I am right and we do nothing then the potential cost to our discipline is high. It is more 'rationale' to assume I am right (to bet on that), if being rational has anything to do with how we ought to lead our scholarly lives. 

>"**6.** In the *Pensées* , Pascal observed that “there are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason.” With regard to language, we might say that there are two analogous extremes: to exclude the possibility that language can adequately express something truthful about the world, to admit only the truths language can convey. I would assent to the claim that there are truths beyond language. There are inexpressible realities and ineffable experiences. But language is itself a miracle and a gift of extraordinary range, power, and beauty. It is one thing to reach the limits of language by testing its resources and searching its depths, and another thing altogether to mistake our own apathy and incuriosity for the inherent limits of speech." (The Convivial Society, Too Many Words, and Not Enough)

[down]

### 2. A specific lens

I have used a specific empirical and rational lens here. It is a lens that is limited and -- like any lens -- it affords particular ways of seeing the world.  

[down]

### 3. Systems of language and understanding

Perhaps it is that the way language is conventionally used in scholarly research is not yet ready for the work we do in somatics. That the work and value of somatics lie outside conventional language or systems of understanding. That somatics is beyond that particular world view. But if this is the case ... what do we do? What do we write? What are we responsible for and who are we responsible to? 

[down]

### 4. Estimating peculiarity

A key limitation of this work is not looking at other disciplines or fields; even adjacent ones like dance studies in a journal like Choreographic Practices (that I co-edit). How do authors in Choreographic Practices report their experiences? Is there something peculiar or unique about somatics practices as presented and represented on the pages of JDSP? My analysis does not address this question of peculiarity at all. Thanks to my colleague Hetty Blades for asking this question of me. 


"One of the questions I always ask of stories is how they *work*. Who do they serve? Who benefits? Who, if anyone, is burdened or harmed by them? Who is uplifted? What modes or methods or structures do they employ? Stories—and metaphors, which are often just stories in miniature—are never neutral actors. They always seek some change, whether through resistance or encouragement or both." (A Working Library, Smoke Screen)

Stories not neutral - openness about desire. 
how am i benefitting? 

"Epistemology doesn’t just ask questions about what we should do to find things out; that is the task of all disciplines to some extent. For example, science, history and anthropology all have their own methods for finding things out.

Epistemology has the job of making those methods themselves the objects of study. It aims to understand how methods of inquiry can be seen as rational endeavours." (Peter Ellerton, How Do You Know That What You Know Is True? That’s Epistemology)

"To review — yes, we come to beliefs before evidence, but we wish not only to express our beliefs but to be thought as reasonable. In some cases, we adopt beliefs considered reasonable by those around us. Sometimes we adopt those beliefs just to seem reasonable. When we adopt beliefs thought by some to be unreasonable, **we supply reasons**, often in the form of evidence. But far from being an afterthought, the evidence we supply is a necessary price we pay for the maintenance of our beliefs. If the reasonableness of a belief becomes too expensive or difficult to maintain, we lose the belief." (mikecaulfield, Reasonableness: An Introduction)

> The human understanding draws everything else to be in harmony with, and to support, those things which once please it, either because they are [generally] received and believed, or because they delight it. And, though it must be admitted that the force and the number of instances that occur to the contrary is greater, it [the understanding] either does not heed them or it disdains them; or, if it does take notice of them, it distances itself from them and dismisses them – and that not without great and pernicious prejudice – so that the authority of those previous beliefs remains inviolate.

And speaking of thanks, it is important that I finish by thanking and acknowledging my colleagues at C-DaRE, many of whom do vital work to make JDSP happen. In particular I thank Teoma Naccarato and Hetty (again) for their support for this work. Thanks also to Anna Pakes and Erin Brannigan for the long and short conversations that often tested my thinking. And, as ever, to the people I have cited here without their permission (including those I have kept anonymous), particularly in the context of a critique. Citation is a remarkably simple system yet what power to notice and to connect, and to be moved and humbled by the work of others.

Thank you.
