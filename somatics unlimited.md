> 	There is a real situation, that can't be denied, but it is too big for any individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and this is a good thing. 

-- Kim Stanley Robinson [-@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free [@eddy-2009-briefa p.6], greater physical expression [@batson-2007-revisiting], physical harmony  [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259], challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse [@beaudry-2015-somatic], "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" [@fortin-2017-looking p.146], and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]. In this presentation I will map and organise the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. I will then use this map to examine i) _interoception_ as an example of the failure of somatic practices in the arts and humanities to work with scientific discourses and laboratories; and ii) the nature of ideology itself and its value and limitations in helping us understand the role and limits of somatic practices. The presentation will address two themes from the call for proposals: what has been missing in explorations of somatics, and the pressing questions for somatics in the future.

## new notes re presentation

- have bowl of journal articles and grab just four. 

See [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#opportunities]] for useful things to add at end of this presentation.

i) the circular logic of arguing from authority, or what Ginot describes as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]; i

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity
- Ginot key
- noting that in most cases the practice (or practices) implicitly are also the mechanism -- noting here wholistic work
- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness.
