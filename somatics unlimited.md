Somatics: how do I disagree? How do we disagree if anything goes? Ginot does this ... who are the others? 

> 	There is a real situation, that can't be denied, but it is too big for any individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and this is a good thing. 

-- Kim Stanley Robinson [-@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free [@eddy-2009-briefa p.6], greater physical expression [@batson-2007-revisiting], physical harmony  [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259], challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse [@beaudry-2015-somatic], "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" [@fortin-2017-looking p.146], and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]. In this presentation I will map and organise the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. I will then use this map to examine i) _interoception_ as an example of the failure of somatic practices in the arts and humanities to work with scientific discourses and laboratories; and ii) the nature of ideology itself and its value and limitations in helping us understand the role and limits of somatic practices. The presentation will address two themes from the call for proposals: what has been missing in explorations of somatics, and the pressing questions for somatics in the future.

_Final abstract:_

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free (Eddy 2009), greater physical expression (Batson 2007), physical harmony (Mullan 2014), challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse (Beaudry 2015), "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" (Fortin 2017), and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" (Kampe 2015). In this presentation I discuss the nature of the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices, and what these claims might say about our responsibilities within and beyond dance research.

## new notes re presentation

- have bowl of journal articles and grab just four. 

See [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#opportunities]] for useful things to add at end of this presentation.

- the circular logic of arguing from authority, or what Ginot describes as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]; i

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity
- Ginot key
- noting that in most cases the practice (or practices) implicitly are also the mechanism -- noting here wholistic work
- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness. 
- ubiquity of term 'somatics' (not a surprise given I was looking at JDSP) -- but certainly the lack of precision is telling. That it is a catch-all. But what is it a catchall of? 
- Olivia Barry mentions interoception: 
> Rooted in movement and sensory perception, somatics explore the body to accrue interoceptive understanding and homeostatic awareness of the process of embodiment.[@barry-2022-tracing p.253]
- this sentence makes zero sense. what is the 'process of embodiment'?
- left out editorials from my collection -- mostly descriptive

- by primary source I mean a claim that is uncited. Sometimes the citation is assumed (as if it's a matter of (uncontestable) fact)
- Barr and Anderson talk explicitly about link between science and somatics (in unproblematic way) and then how somatics extended beyond its association with science (p.11)
- Barr and Anderson: "However, when returning to Hanna’s definition of somatics in conjunction with such ideas, questions about unspoken implications and consequences surface (Green 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017)"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] -- worth looking at these and how unspoken they are?
- "Somatics is neither a monolith nor a panacea"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] 
- very useful re dance / science -- including citations

> In 1997 somatics philosopher Elizabeth Behnke wrote: ‘[s]omatics is a field that is still in the process of creating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of its history, and searching out an appropriate language for its theory and practice’ (1997: 667). [@barr-2022-illuminating p.17] 
- can say what most number of claims was in single article
- percentage of 1º vs 2º
- mechanism -- why does it matter? If it works, who cares how? 
- list the various practices/names/langauge in column b
- noting how practice and mechanism are almost exclusively the same thing

> The efficiency and benefits of applying somatic methods or practices to dance training have also been explored (Green 1999; Batson 2007; Eddy 2009).[@sen-podstawska-2022-moving p.52] 

- if mentioned the same benefit more than once in same article, listed them all

- what does it mean to be good at somatics? How do we recognise someone who is 'good' at somatics? It's a funny/silly/old question/joke about somatics, but so much of what we can't and can say about somatics rests on the capacity to understand and communicate what it is we are observing/noticing (in ourselves and in others) when doing somatics well. See in [[Zoran Josipovic - Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain#^448a09]] and also note the Varela reference in that blockquote.

Thinking through Ginot's statement that the purpose of science in somatics is to "foster belief" [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#^fd4fbc]]. Linking here with Ingold's [[search for truth]] and the unison of imagination and experience, and of taking ourselves into the world. But how are we failing to do that in somatic practices? Contrast also with [[map and territory]] and my sense is that in the claims we are making we are attempting to construct the territory -- or to colonise the territory from a very small island. Note a very early idea I had in [[zen, map and territory]] in which I describe [[authentic movement]] as a dance with territory or even noumenal experience ([[noumenon and phenomenon]]) -- really really not sure about this last bit. Noting also here the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and practices re 'knowing' the noumenon: [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^e2cbd2]] The Kantian thing seems to be about the un-naming (which is to know the unknowable 'thing in itself'). Non-dual awareness ticks into here -- that when there is no self, the unknowing ceases to be something that one can not do. 


> also refer to the validation methods of phenomenology and Buddhist practices saying it ‘[...] is derived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience and self-understanding’ (Varela et al. 1991: xix), a validation that also applies to somatic practices, given that it can only be measured from the observation of changes perceived by the individuals directly involved in the experience. [@silvagrebler-2020-reflection p.18]

- is this the issue -- "can only be measured"? But does that mean we get to say anything we want about it? 

Nuding's article also useful

> Much work has been done to highlight pitfalls of the sociocultural framings that have shaped -- and continue to shape -- somatics discourse and practice (Ginot 2010; De Giorgi 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017; Fortin 2017; Eddy 2002; Green 2015). p.30

From Marchevska: third nature (from Tsing) also Mignolo


> In this frame, dance relies on a high degree of specialised and high contact-based training that culminates in performances or financially expensive presentations in specialised venues [...] dance in this context becomes an elite activity within an ecology of'refined'culture that claims to be rooted in the identity formation of everyday life and, yet, services relatively small sections of the community. (Phillips 2004: 1)  - in Laidlow 2021

- this is a very good article (Laidlaw)

> Phenomenology, first established by Edmund Husserl, studies consciousness and its embodied processes (Husserl [1900] 1970). Its teachings hold that features of experience appear and transform in consciousness. Fraleigh, p.114

- mentions non dual awareness and Dogen Zen (p.114)

- by primary I mean a claim that is not attributed OR has come from the research being presented (vast % is simply a statement of fact (opinion))

- what I am most struck by is cells of information. One new idea after another. There are exceptions of course -- Nuding, Laidlaw -- but they prove the rule. We are -- through the journal -- building a patchwork quilt that is only really able to keep warm those who lie under it. But even in such a quilt there is a sense of relationship between the patches. Push this metaphor? Stitched together. 
- surprising just how little 2º there was -- my hunch was about Anna Pakes' idea
- also how many are just sharing practice -- not a comment. These might make no claims at all (just describe it) all the way to overselling the hell out of it
- what is it to make a claim? on what grounds? How is it different from an opinion? 
- Hetty: other fields similar to somatics? what about music (re making claims)
- dig deeper into the kinds of claims I was looking for -- need clarity here
- thinking about motivated reasoning --- but what other approaches might there be: cynical, caring, curiosity (approaches to how I understand my experience of reviewing these articles)
- Grebler in 12.1 gives great overview of Varela
- could go a global search for Varela in JDSP???? and Batson
- backfire effect vs confirmation bias: how do you respond to this? 
- even those not making claims are still proposing or assuming something. and what's the issue with evidence? 
- ain't nothing wrong with claims -- it's more they type/kind that I think is worth discussing 
- a claim is what it does: what affects and effects. Distinct from a description??
- noting: just how many different kinds of practices are presented in JDSP: some newly named, some very familiar. mostly very poorly described as to what they are in practice (in ways that would be recognisable for those not familar) -- abstract terms, non-specific
- 

Hetty:
> I think I was asking about whether you were recording claims about people's specific experiences (eg. My engagement with a somatic practice achieves…for me) or general claims (somatic practices/BMC/SRT etc achieves….).

- see Poynor 2019 note: difference between claim and aim -- how the word aim is in there. 
- ones that are descriptive of process make fewer claims. Vital role -- in knowing. But rarely if ever (as I've written about elsewhere) talk about similar practices. Isolated bubbles. 
- noting how differently I feel when no claims are made. That I am left to invest so differently (but also feel a little lost -- like watching art). How art doesn't make claims. 
- seems like these are closer to the level of myths or beliefs. Even hopes, wishes or desires. 
- there's a bigger question about how we find things out. A question of method. how is it that we come to make this claim? methods are discipline specific. JDSP is full of many many kinds of methods: scientific interventions, ethnography, practice research, phenomenology, various qualitative practices (some with content analysis, some more akin to case studies) dance analysis, reflections, descriptions, various combinations of these. Many unstated. That is, it's not so clear how the writer got to say the things they are saying. Opinion. 
- where is place for the 'rational' in this conversation? 
- how might each of just justify the things we say? 
- title "somatics unlimited" was based on a hunch. method is fragile because of this hunch. confirmation bias. to guard against it (if that's even possible)
- on what grounds do each of us get to say the things we say. Examples of descriptions of practice are perhaps most intriguing. Make no claims but rather are sharing what work is happening. 
- Ellerton article for The Conversation is useful. https://read.readwise.io/new/read/01gyhnwb6edbv3zxwh6j4wx4p4
- very few give mechanisms for what somatics do. VERY few. 
- stretch beyond individual (or atomised) claims ... what might our collective wisdom be (as a scholarly and artistic community) and on what grounds can we imagining rejecting a claim, or (at the very least) expressing doubt about it? 
- most of these claims are not falsifiable -- but calling on that word (and the legacy of Popper) is likely troubling in this context. What do we have to do to the practices to make them accountable to methods that value falsifiability? (Popper's falsifiability principle or razor: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable. (wikipedia) -- but )
- these beliefs are sincere. We repeat them often. But sincerity and repetition are not the grounds by which we build an expansive understanding on the limits of somatic practices. 
- is there value in suspending belief? 
- our convictions
- a claim without evidence is just an opinion: Hitchens's razor: "is an epistemological razor that serves as a general rule for rejecting certain knowledge claims. It states "what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."" - named after Christopher Hitchen's
- "In philosophy, a razor is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate ("shave off") unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions." - from wikipedia
- collins dictionary: when i say someone claims something, I imply doubt; https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/make-a-claim
- as a countable noun: A claim is something which someone says which they cannot prove and which may be false.

How is this defensible? This position in somatics? 
Language is superficial. We have a superficiality problem.
