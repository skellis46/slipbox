# Somatics Unlimited

_previous note:_ [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]

![[somatics unlimited map.canvas]]

## The things we say

Here are four claims made on behalf of somatics and drawn from the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. 

> Embodied perspectives can enrich traditional theories and approaches [Meier et al 2012, in @petsilas-2019-embodied p.182]

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

> [Eye contact in Authentic movement] can communicate so many feelings as well as compassion or empathy; it enables a direct meeting from the depths of the souls, without words. [@halstrup-2015-bones p.290]

> By adopting a somatic approach to conducting research, writing, creating art, or engaging in another profession, we become more alive to what touches us and how our work and presence can touch others. [@saumaa-2020-somaticist p.237]

## Making claims

What does it mean to _claim_ something? 

A "claim is something which someone says which they cannot prove and which may be false" [@noauthor-nodate-claim]. To claim something is also to "assert and demand recognition" or possession of something. And when we say someone claims something, we suggest doubt [@noauthor-nodate-claim]. 

What a claim is not is an argument.

> Claims backed by reasons that are supported by evidence are called arguments. [@nordquist-2020-what n.pag.]

A claim without evidence is simply an opinion or _assertion_. 

I have used the word _claim_ because while reading JDSP over the years I started to see a tendency or pattern -- a pattern of unsubstantiated assertions about the value and currency of somatic practices: as if somatics has unlimited value, scope, and power to produce change. We -- and by we I mean those of us who contribute to the journal -- we seem fine to say whatever we like about the effects and benefits of somatic practices.  

In doing this work I do not seek to shame our field or tear it down. If anything, I see myself as a believer in the transformative powers of somatic practices: I have experienced their benefits, and continue to practice a version of authentic movement as an anchor to my understanding of movement, sensation and consciousness. Rather, I want to understand the epistemic values and costs of somatic practices as represented by the materials published in JDSP. 

## An unfinished catalogue of claims

Late last year, I started something that I have not yet finished. I started cataloguing every claim made on behalf of somatic practices in JDSP. 

I haven't yet finished this cataloguing effort because I ran out of time. In fact, I didn't get close. Up to Volume 14.2 in 2022, 271 articles have been published in JDSP. This number excludes editorials, reports, book reviews and volume 14.1S, but includes interviews and editorials for special issues. To this date I have only worked through 85 of these 271, which is just shy of a third. 

My observations today have emerged from working with the JDSP archive.

## A note on cherry picking

Human beings are cherry pickers. We seek and notice examples that confirm our beliefs or ideas and don't notice or ignore examples that contradict these beliefs. Such confirmation biases are not conscious. For example, goal-oriented motivated reasoning is driven by personal emotions. That is, the heuristic for judging new information is, more or less: how does this information make me feel? 

In this presentation I have tried to mitigate against cherry picking. I did this by randomly selecting 20 articles from the full 271 and then worked my way down that list of 20 articles to include as examples in this presentation. For example, I drew the quote-claims I presented at the beginning from the first four randomly selected articles. This randomised process also reveals just how common the following observations are in the JDSP corpus. 

## Six observations

### 1. Abstractions

Most of the dizzying number of practices presented in JDSP are described in ways that would be difficult to recognise for those not already in the know. Their descriptions contain abstractions that are easily taken for granted. 

Here's an example. It's a strange example but it was the next cab off my randomised rank, and it concerns the humble plié. 

> A plié is a bend of the knees. Pliés can be done in many different positions: first, second, third, fourth: open and crossed fifth, and parallel. In all cases, the left and right knees bend equally, although certain position of the feet, like fourth open, cause a slightly uneven distribution of weight – making the achievement of even-ness in the knee-bend very challenging.[@deleon-2009-potent p.90]

Note the abstractions. What is a position? What is crossed fifth? What is parallel? Regarding distribution of weight, does this mean if I bend my knees while lying down (or with my legs in the air while on my back) that this is not a plié or knee-bend? Who then is this writing for other than people who already know (and perhaps believe) in this work? 

The lack of precision and the weight of abstractions is telling. Perhaps the lack of precision is even a feature and not a bug.

> We are the unreliable narrators of our own experience. [@rubin-2023-creative Location 1813]

There is tremendous responsibility in clarifying our abstractions because "extraction follows closely on the heels of abstraction" [@mcquillan-2022-resisting n.pag.] And with extraction comes exploitation. Now you could say, "It's just a bloody plié Simon" and I would understand. But even in such a benign example who and what might we be exploiting through our abstractions, even if the exploitation is of an epistemic space? 

### 2. Mechanisms are as rare as hens teeth

I catalogued whether articles contained any description of the mechanism for the beneficial claims made on behalf of each somatic practice. By "mechanism" I mean some hint of _how_ the somatic practice did what the author said it did. Few articles in JDSP do this: about one in five of those I reviewed. In most cases, the practice (or practices) are implicitly also the mechanism. In other words, somatic practice x can lead to effect y through the somatic practice process x. 

When articles do contain mechanisms they are mostly vague or it's not possible to find out if the mechanisms even have anything to do with the somatic practice linked to the claim. 

Here's an example. It's the next one off my list of randomly selected articles, and is from Vicky Wright's remarkable 2021 reflection on _Using mask to explore earlier evolutionary states of sensory awareness, and their role in our inter-relationship with the natural world_ [-@wright-2021-using].

In this I labelled the somatic practice as _Phylogenetic mask work_ which I appreciate is not your run-of-the-mill somatic practice. Wright claimed that this mask work:

> can help us to overcome a human/nature alienation and instead create connection.[@wright-2021-using p.203]

There is some sense of mechanism for this effect described by Wright as the "'animal' or 'natural' modes of sensing available to us within our bodies" [@wright-2021-using p.203]. In other words, it is the animal and nature modes of sensing that are _how_ the mask work helps us to overcome human/nature alienation. 

I have lots of questions here, not least how it is that we would know if this mechanism (if indeed it is a mechanism for change) was doing its work, or (more usefully) how would we know if it were not the mechanism for this effect? 

Why does this matter? If practice x leads to effect y does it matter how, especially if the effect is due to the holistic nature of the practice: something ineffable, immeasurable or unfathomable? 

I think it matters because if we have no understanding of the mechanisms of change then we cannot say which part of a practice is responsible for the changes we seem to be seeing and describing. It's a monumental question. _How_ does this practice do this? Without this question our claims are flimsy. They remain simply claims. Perhaps though the lack of 'mechanisms' is not surprising. These are (by and large) not the kinds of methods we adopt in our work. 

A philosophical razor is a rule of thumb designed to shave off unlikely explanations of phenomena; a time-saving device. Hitchens' epistemological razor is designed to reject certain knowledge claims. It was created by and named after renowned journalist and atheist Christopher Hitchens: 

> What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. [@hitchens-2007-god p.258]

Hitchens was using the razor in the context of refuting religious belief, but what it does more broadly is put the burden of proof on the person making the claim. For example, if I claim that somatic practices improve physical coordination, then it is my responsibility to try and provide the evidence to build that argument. 

As an aside, I read no claims that indicated some negative effect or outcome because of a somatic practice. This is bizarre. I can remember one incident during an Awareness Through Movement class when a first time student had a destructive experience based on the assumptions the teacher was making about sight and sightedness. Where are those anecdotes in our journal? 

### 3. Patchwork quilt

The articles in the journal are mostly individual cells of information that present their own ideas oblivious to other practices and debates in the field (including the journal itself). It is as if we are -- through the journal -- creating the start of a patchwork quilt in which the various (and different) pieces are waiting to be stitched together, or perhaps are roughly held together by the acronym JDSP.  

Perhaps this patchwork phenomenon is a thing because somatics as an artistic-scholarly field is still fledgling? But is it still fledgling? When might we be ready enough to shed the _new_ label? I worry that we hide behind the _new_ label to rationalise this patchwork phenomenon I have observed and am describing. Thinking of ourselves as fledgling is perhaps how we get to say what we want without slowly building foundations of intra-disciplinary dialogue and debate. 

### 4. Descriptions of practice

The articles that most commonly do NOT make claims are those that are simple descriptions or presentations of practice. For example Whitehead [-@whitehead-2021-stitching], Crisp and Roberts [-@crisp-2021-reflections], Tokunow et al [-@tokunow-2021-stages], Wolfman [-@wolfman-2021-video], and Weber Da Silva et al [-@weberdasilva-2020-am]. I sought out these examples (rather than relying on drawing them out randomly) as they contradicted my hunch about claim-making in JDSP. 

It seems that one vital part of the Journal's role is as a place to share current practices. I'll note though -- and this is a particular bugbear of mine [see @ellis-forthcoming-ecosystemic] -- that rarely are these descriptions of practice drawn into dialogue with other similar or overlapping practices. They are more or less isolated bubbles of practice which likewise contribute to the patchwork effect I have just discussed. 

### 5. Arguing from authority

When I began this work I assumed that the claims made for somatics would veer towards being claims (or appeals) to authority. The fallacy of _appeal to authority_ is when "a claim is supported by reference to an authority instead of offering reasons to support it" [@novaes-2021-argument n.pag.] These are akin to what Isabelle Ginot -- in her landmark critique of somatic practices in 2010 -- described as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]. 

But I was surprised. Of the articles I reviewed, about two-thirds made what I called primary claims. That is, a claim that makes no reference to research or scholarship by other people (it is uncited or assumed) and/or is based on the practices described in the article.

Yet perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. These primary claims align with the patchwork I have just described. They are primary claims that are placed into the aether of somatics practices discourses, and rarely, if ever, support, interrupt, change or unsettle the practices (and their epistemic underpinnings) already presented in the journal. 

If we look at citation patterns for articles in JDSP it starts to make the patchwork picture of primary claims very stark indeed. I have zero interest in the quantitative crudeness of citation indices: "Just because something is easy to measure doesn't mean it's accurate. Or that it matters" [@godin-2023-song n.pag.]. The number of citations is not necessarily correlated to the quality or reliability of research; however it is a rough estimate of the influence of an article (whether positive or negative).

Here then are the number of times the next five articles from my random selection have been cited. 

- Angharad Harrop [-@harrop-2014-can] _I can feel his heart beating through the sole of my foot: Reflections on improvisation from a dancer finding her feet_: cited 3 times   
- Claire Loussouarn [-@loussouarn-2021-this] _This urban wild field in Hackney Marshes_: cited 0 times    
- Carol Marie Webster [-@webster-2019-chat] _Chat to Mi Back: Meditation on body archive_: cited 0 times  
- Leonardo José Sebiane Serrano [-@sebianeserrano-2020-mestizoa] _Mestizo Corporalities: Tropical/vibrant Latin American bodies_: cited 2 times  
- Carol Brown [-@brown-2017-entangled] _Entangled histories, part 1: Releasing the Archive_: cited 4 times (including one self-citation).

These numbers might say something about the relative size of our field (and the numbers ought to be expressed as a percentage of total articles and then compared with other journals in any given discipline), but the raw numbers also indicate that we are not engaging in debates within the field. If there were such debates these numbers would be higher, and I think the field would be richer for it.

The field would be richer for it because when we make an academic claim (a claim you make in an argument) it is "considered debatable or up for inquiry" [@nordquist-2020-what n.pag]. Through debate we make dissent possible, and a research field is only as strong as what it allows to be questioned. When asked how to minimise the impact of cognitive biases in human debate, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman said, "protect the dissenters" [@parrish-2020-daniel] by making dissent painless.

Here's Australian philosopher Peter Ellerton: 

> That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

I'm curious about this phrase _epistemic credibility_. Without the kind of process that Ellerton describes then I worry that we end up in some kind of vicious circle of epistemological impoverishment in which there are no limits to the claims made on behalf of somatic practices, which means there are no grounds to debate such claims, which means there are no limits to the claims, etc.

### 6. Doing the can-can

This last observation is about the word _can_. I'll use the next two articles from my random set. Here's Andrée Grau writing in JDSP in 2011: 

> This prerogative of the visual can be seen in everyday life, when ‘seeing’ is equated to ‘understanding’ [@grau-2011-dancing p.9]

And here's Sylvie Fortin and Élise Hardy writing in 2018 and citing Fortin from 2015: 

> focusing on the micro-political body through somatic education can help women exercise agency within the matrix of social inequalities they live in. [Fortin 2015, in @fortin-2018-fibromyalgia p.271]

Just to be clear: Both of these articles are remarkable and I have enormous respect for the authors ... and I sure have missed Andrée in these last difficult years. 

In both quotes, the word _can_ is the same as the term "to be able to". But the stakes of Fortin and Hardy's _can_ are high. Their _can_ is implicated in a claim about a benefit of somatic practices: somatic practice x CAN lead to effect y. Once you start seeing the word _can_ used in this way in JDSP you see it everywhere. Perhaps this is a case of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon (also called the frequency illusion) -- that thing that happens when you learn a word or idea and then start seeing it everywhere -- but my suspicion is that we in JDSP deploy the word _can_ as a _hedge_ very often indeed. 

Let's take another look at the claims I presented at the beginning. Remember, these were from the first four articles drawn at random from all 271 articles in JDSP: 

> Embodied perspectives can enrich traditional theories and approaches [Meier et al 2012, in @petsilas-2019-embodied p.182]

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

> [Eye contact in Authentic movement] can communicate so many feelings as well as compassion or empathy; it enables a direct meeting from the depths of the souls, without words. [@halstrup-2015-bones p.290]

> By adopting a somatic approach to conducting research, writing, creating art, or engaging in another profession, we become more alive to what touches us and how our work and presence can touch others. [@saumaa-2020-somaticist p.237]

Why does this _can_ matter? It matters because how does anyone refute such a _can_? Yes, somatic practice X can produce effect y, but it's so loose. Under what conditions? When does it NOT produce such an effect? The _can_ inadvertently serves as a way to reduce the possibility of argument or refutation. Or perhaps it is a form of epistemic humility; of not wanting to make strong assertions. But I worry that these _cans_ also function as, to be crude, academic arse-covering. 

Just to note that this last _can_ by Saumaa is more akin to the way Grau used the word, and is less like a hedged claim. And what is striking about the Saumaa example is that, without the slipperiness of the word _can_ as part of the direct claim, it becomes a bolder assertion highlighted by the phrase "we become". Perhaps such boldness opens and creates more space for debate. 

## Four brief limitations to finish

### 1. Feeling uncertain and the cost of being right or wrong

How certain do I feel that these various observations show systemic problems in somatics? Clearly my evidence is partial, and not nearly as rigorous as I would have liked it to be. I also think I set about looking for these kinds of issues. I am more contrary than I'd like to imagine myself to be, and I did not start out with neutral eyes. But even given those caveats, this work I have presented (with analysis of nearly one-third of all articles presented in JDSP) is also not nothing. The epistemic exit polls don't look good for us. 

I think a version of Pascal's wager based on probability theory is useful here. Pascal proposed that "humans bet with their lives that God either exists or does not" [@noauthor-2020-pascal n.pag.], and that the rationale thing would be to bet that God exists. If you are right you get all the trappings of the good life after death, but if you are wrong you lose little if anything. 

In our case (and this is a slight twist) the cost of my being right far exceeds the cost of my being wrong. If I am wrong but we still enter the debates, continue to challenge the claims we make etc, then I think somatics scholarship and epistemology is strengthened. But if I am right and we do nothing then the potential cost to our discipline is high. It is more 'rationale' to assume I am right (to bet on that), if being rational has anything to do with how we ought to lead our scholarly lives. 

### 2. A specific lens

I have used a specific empirical and rational lens here. It is a lens that is limited and -- like any lens -- it affords particular ways of seeing the world.  

### 3. Systems of language and understanding

Perhaps it is that the way language is conventionally used in scholarly research is not yet ready for the work we do in somatics. That the work and value of somatics lie outside conventional language or systems of understanding. That somatics is beyond that particular world view. But if this is the case ... what do we do? What do we write? What are we responsible for and who are we responsible to? 

### 4. Estimating peculiarity

A key limitation of this work is not looking at other disciplines or fields; even adjacent ones like dance studies in a journal like Choreographic Practices (that I co-edit). How do authors in Choreographic Practices report their experiences? Is there something peculiar or unique about somatics practices as presented and represented on the pages of JDSP? My analysis does not address this question of peculiarity at all. Thanks to my colleague Hetty Blades for asking this question of me. 


--- 

And speaking of thanks, it is important that I finish by thanking and acknowledging my colleagues at C-DaRE, and in particular Teoma Naccarato and Hetty (again) and for their support and enthusiasm (my word) for this work. Thanks also to Anna Pakes and Erin Brannigan for the long and short conversations that often tested my thinking. And, as ever, to the people I have cited here without their permission, particularly in the context of a critique. Citation is a remarkably simply system yet what power to notice and to connect, and to be moved and humbled by the work of others.

Thank you.
