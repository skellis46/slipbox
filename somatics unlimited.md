## the things we say

- start with list of five? 


## an unfinished catalogue of claims

Late last year I started something that I have not yet finished. I started cataloguing every claim made on behalf of somatic practices in the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices since the journal began in 2009. 

I think by using the word _claim_ I've shown my hand more than a little. The word implies that I have adopted suspicious eyes. I did not, for instance, attempt to catalogue the arguments or _facts_ in JDSP, and it's important to remember that there are arguments in its pages, as there are facts. 

I have used the word _claim_ because while reading JDSP over the years (I would guess that as of now it is the journal I have read most in my scholarly life, perhaps along with IJSD and CHOR -- but then I've co-edited those journals) I think I started to see a pattern -- a pattern of unsubstantiated assertions about the value and currency of somatic practices. I would say that I developed a bias to notice such claims and I was worried that the bias attempting to guard against merely confirming that bias. In short, in undertaking this process I wanted to understand the epistemic values of JDSP and what these values say about our community of practice and scholarship. 

- ain't nothing wrong with claims -- it's more the type/kind that I think is worth discussing (or is it my perception of the quantity?)

But what does it mean to make a claim? 

There are two useful things here. First, as a countable noun, a "claim is something which someone says which they cannot prove and which may be false" (https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/make-a-claim). Second, when I say someone claims something, I imply doubt (https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/make-a-claim).

- a claim without evidence is just an opinion: Hitchens's razor: "is an epistemological razor that serves as a general rule for rejecting certain knowledge claims. It states "what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."" - named after Christopher Hitchens
- "In philosophy, a razor is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate ("shave off") unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions." - from wikipedia

- what is it to make a claim? on what grounds? How is it different from an opinion? 

- [[types of claims]]

> Claims of fact assert that something is true or not true.  
> Claims of value assert that something is good or bad, or more or less desirable.  
> Claims of policy assert that one course of action is superior to another.[@nordquist-2020-what n.pag]

In JDSP it is as if we are mixing up claims of fact with claims of value. (see Nordquist 2020)

- even those not making claims are still proposing or assuming something. and what's the issue with evidence? 



I haven't yet finished this cataloguing effort because I ran out of time. To date (2022 14.2), 272 articles have been published in JDSP. This number excludes editorials, reports, book reviews and 14.1S (translations of Martha Eddy's 2009 history), but includes interviews and editorials for special issues which were fuller than regular editorials. I worked through 85 of these or 31%. 

- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness. 
- title "somatics unlimited" was based on a hunch. method is fragile because of this hunch. confirmation bias. to guard against it (if that's even possible)

That pattern appears to be that we -- and by we I mean those of us who contribute to the journal -- seem fine to say pretty much whatever we like about the effects of somatic practices. That somatics has unlimited value, scope, and power to produce change, irrespective of the context. It is an extraordinary list even if perhaps it's also a little unfair on my part to pluck them out of context and put them next to each other like this:

[[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

My hunch was that the evidence for claims would be secondary. That the predominance would be arguing from authority. Early on in the journal. But in later volumes not at all. By far we are making primary claims. Almost total lack of mechanisms for these claims. That is, if we say somatics does this, then how does it do this? Perhaps the lack of 'mechanisms' is not surprising. These are (by and large) not the methods we adopt in our work. [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] warned us with her concerns. 
- surprising number of simply descriptive accounts of practice. No claims. Refreshing. That the journal is/was a place to share current practices. Not in touch with other practices though (see Ellis forthcoming)
- very few give mechanisms for what somatics do. VERY few. 

- by primary source I mean a claim that is uncited. Sometimes the citation is assumed (as if it's a matter of (uncontestable) fact)

When I started my hunch was that the claims made on behalf of somatics would veer towards being claims (or appeals) to authority. 

- by primary I mean a claim that is not attributed OR has come from the research being presented (vast % is simply an opinion in fact's clothing)
- dig deeper into the kinds of claims I was looking for -- need clarity here -- see Hetty's comments

## a note about cherry picking

My assumption is that we are all guilty of cherry-picking. We seek examples that confirm our beliefs or ideas and ignore examples that contradict or are contrary to these beliefs. I don't think we do this deliberately or consciously, but we do do it. Cherry picking is also known as the fallacy of incomplete evidence, and in science it is an epistemological characteristic of denialism. 

To this end, all examples I have included in this presentation were not cherry picked. Rather, I randomly selected 20 articles from the 272 and then worked my way down that selection. Result of not completing my analysis in time (and later -- after a conversation with my colleague Anna Pakes -- realising that a more rigorous corpus would be ideal for this kind of linguistic analysis). For example, the list of quote-claims I presented at the beginning were drawn -- one each -- from the first five randomly selected articles. Where an article did not include an example ... This process is to avoid claims that I have cherry picked examples, but also as an indication of how common the following observations are. 

You might (rightly) question my values here or attempt to understand what might be in it for me. What are the motivations for my reasoning? I can say I am worried. I worry for what this pattern might mean for our field -- a field that I am indebted to, that is fundamental to my practice (as artist-scholar) and that deeply nourishes how I participate in the world. 

- thinking about motivated reasoning --- but what other approaches might there be: cynical, caring, curiosity (approaches to how I understand my experience of reviewing these articles)

What I did not cherry pick were examples that contradicted my observations. I sought them out. Exception proving rule? Or the possibility of another way? 

## some observations from this work

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity

- noting that in most cases the practice (or practices) implicitly are also the mechanism -- noting here wholistic work

- ubiquity of term 'somatics' (not a surprise given I was looking at JDSP) -- but certainly the lack of precision is telling. That it is a catch-all, or suitcase word. But what is it a catchall of? [[define your terms]]


- can say what most number of claims was in single article
- percentage of 1ยบ vs 2ยบ
- mechanism -- why does it matter? If it works, who cares how? Because if we have no understanding of mechanisms than we don't know which part of a practice is responsible for the changes we seem to be seeing (or indeed if it's the gestalt of the practice). See [[measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices]]
- list the various practices/names/language in column b
- noting how practice and mechanism are almost exclusively the same thing - circularity

- could go through this one to group some claims together:
> The efficiency and benefits of applying somatic methods or practices to dance training have also been explored (Green 1999; Batson 2007; Eddy 2009).[@sen-podstawska-2022-moving p.52] 

- some claims will be very familiar.
- - useful summary at beginning of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] -- describes pedagogic, better (more virtuosic) dancing, injury prevention and rehab
-  leavened by occasional humility or caution: "sometimes overzealous and too narrowly optimistic stances towards somatics" (written as a counter to this)[@fortin-2017-looking p.146]
-  some claims less familiar. 

### patchwork
- what I am most struck by is cells of information. One new idea after another. There are exceptions of course -- Nuding, Laidlaw -- but they prove the rule. We are -- through the journal -- building a patchwork quilt in which the various pieces are stitched together by the initials JDSP that is only really able to keep warm those who lie under it. But even in such a quilt there is a sense of relationship between the patches. Push this metaphor? Stitched together. 
- I wonder if we could all agree that this phenomena in JDSP is a thing. We don't have to agree on whether it is a good or bad thing. But that it exists. 
- noting: just how many different kinds of practices are presented in JDSP: some newly named, some very familiar. mostly very poorly described as to what they are in practice (in ways that would be recognisable for those not familar) -- abstract terms, non-specific

### descriptions
- also how many are just sharing practice -- not a comment. These might make no claims at all (just describe it) all the way to overselling the hell out of it
- note to make a distinction between claims and descriptions that make or do not make claims
- Hetty: other fields similar to somatics? what about music (re making claims)

Hetty:
> I think I was asking about whether you were recording claims about people's specific experiences (eg. My engagement with a somatic practice achievesโฆfor me) or general claims (somatic practices/BMC/SRT etc achievesโฆ.).
- my sense here is that the language makes the distinction tricky. There is slippage from the subjective to the general without acknowledging the shift. Give example.

- ones that are descriptive of process make fewer claims. Vital role -- in knowing. But rarely if ever (as I've written about elsewhere) talk about similar practices. Isolated bubbles.

- on what grounds do each of us get to say the things we say (Hetty's note about specific vs general is useful here). Examples of descriptions of practice are perhaps most intriguing. Make no claims but rather are sharing what work is happening.
- noting how differently I feel when no claims are made. That I am left to invest so differently (but also feel a little lost -- like watching art). How art (for the most part) doesn't make claims. 

### the question of measurement and observation

> also refer to the validation methods of phenomenology and Buddhist practices saying it โ[...] is derived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience and self-understandingโ (Varela et al. 1991: xix), a validation that also applies to somatic practices, given that it can only be measured from the observation of changes perceived by the individuals directly involved in the experience. [@silvagrebler-2020-reflection p.18]

- is this the issue -- "can only be measured"? But does that mean we get to say anything we want about it? 

- what does it mean to be good at somatics? How do we recognise someone who is 'good' at somatics? It's a funny/silly/old question/joke about somatics, but so much of what we can't and can say about somatics rests on the capacity to understand and communicate what it is we are observing/noticing (in ourselves and in others) when doing somatics well. See in [[Zoran Josipovic - Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain#^448a09]] and also note the Varela reference in that blockquote.


### the case of _can_


### arguing from authority

In 2010, the dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner, Isabelle Ginot wrote a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. The article is called _From Shustermanโs Somaesthetics to a Radical Epistemology of Somatics_ [@ginot-2010-shusterman] and in it Ginot asks some difficult questions of somatic practices. _adjust this paragraph to focus on epistemological critique of Ginot's._ withering critique in the role of science to validate the "highly individualized"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15] experiences of somatic practices. 

It is the most sustained and well argued critique of somatic practices scholarship I have happened across (although also enjoyed Elisa Nuding in Volume 13 of JDSP)

Don't want to simply replicate Ginot's thinking and argument.

- surprising just how little 2ยบ there was -- my hunch was about Anna Pakes' idea
- the circular logic of arguing from authority, or what Ginot describes as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]; i

The fallacy of appeal to authority (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/argument/#Fall)
Also _Argumentation as an epistemic practice_ -- relates to Nordquist above (but compare with confirmation bias, and the backfire effect! -- motivated reasoning):

> In particular, arguments that threaten our core beliefs and our sense of belonging to a group (e.g., political beliefs) typically trigger all kinds of motivated reasoning (Taber & Lodge 2006; Kahan 2017) whereby one outright rejects those arguments without properly engaging with their content. Relatedly, when choosing among a vast supply of options, people tend to gravitate towards content and sources that confirm their existing opinions, thus giving rise to so-called โecho chambersโ and โepistemic bubblesโ (Nguyen 2020). Furthermore, some arguments can be deceptively convincing in that they look valid but are not (Tindale 2007; see entry on [fallacies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fallacies/)). Because most of us are arguably not very good at spotting fallacious arguments, especially if they are arguments that lend support to the beliefs we already hold, engaging in argumentation may in fact _decrease_ the accuracy of our beliefs by persuading us of false conclusions with incorrect arguments (Fantl 2018). <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/argument/#Fall>

- backfire effect vs confirmation bias: how do you respond to this? 

## analysis (possible things to discuss)

- Ellerton article for The Conversation is useful. https://read.readwise.io/new/read/01gyhnwb6edbv3zxwh6j4wx4p4 -- very very good as overview of some suggestions I might make. 

> That we test each othersโ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry.[@ellerton-2017-how]

> The sincerity of oneโs belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to โbelieve meโ should not be rationally persuasive by themselves.[@ellerton-2017-how]

- stretch beyond individual (or atomised) claims ... what might our collective wisdom be (as a scholarly and artistic community) and on what grounds can we imagining rejecting a claim, or (at the very least) expressing doubt about it? 

overdetermination: โoccurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effectโ โ looking at definition of overdetermination -- it's like somatics is the opposite. A single thing responsible for every effect - but not clear what that single thing is. Certainly appears closer to underdeterminism: Evidence we have is not sufficient to know what to believe. Relates here more to biases -- that is, we already know what to believe, we are just making things fit into those belief systems. This is ideology.

> Consider again the nature of ideology, that necessary thing, which allows us to sort out the massive influx of information we experience. Could ideology also be a cognitive illusion, a kind of necessary fiction?

- from Ministry for the future.
- Somatics as ideology. Making sense. See also earlier parts in book about ideology.
- beliefs

See [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#opportunities]] for useful things to add at end of this presentation.

Somatics: how do I disagree? How do we disagree if anything goes? use my viscious cycle of epistemology. Ginot does this ... who are the others?

> An academic claim--a claim you make in an argument--is considered debatable or up for inquiry. - Nordquist, readwise 

-- but where and when are the debates happening?

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity



They become truisms. A word like that? 

- [[extraction follows abstraction]] -- that there is tremendous responsibility in owning and clarifying our abstractions. See also [[define your terms]] and suitcase words. Vagueness and abstraction go hand in hand. But exploitation soon follows. Who and what might we be exploiting? (even if exploitation is about the exploitation of an epistemic space?)
- embodiment as we tend to use it (even though it is used in wildly different ways) seems to be predicated on the body as special kind of object, but an object nevertheless. See [[the lived body and embodiment#^844cda]]. On this point see also [[the body in artistic research#^b4be45]] and Le Guin on just how badly objectification has gone for human-kind and our plant.
- see also [[explaining away (Whitehead)]] re abstractions: "denied the status of proper existence"

- seems like these are closer to the level of myths or beliefs. Even hopes, wishes or desires. 
- there's a bigger question about how we find things out. A question of method. how is it that we come to make this claim? methods are discipline specific. JDSP is full of many many kinds of methods: scientific interventions, ethnography, practice research, phenomenology, various qualitative practices (some with content analysis, some more akin to case studies) dance analysis, reflections, descriptions, various combinations of these. Many unstated. That is, it's not so clear how the writer got to say the things they are saying. Opinion. 
- where is place for the 'rational' in this conversation? 
- how might each of us justify the things we say? 

- most of these claims are not falsifiable -- but calling on that word (and the legacy of Popper) is likely troubling in this context. What do we have to do to the practices to make them accountable to methods that value falsifiability? (Popper's falsifiability principle or razor: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable. (wikipedia) -- but )
- these beliefs are sincere. We repeat them often. But sincerity and repetition are not the grounds by which we build an expansive understanding on the limits of somatic practices. 
- is there value in suspending belief? (and our convictions). What might scepticism be worth to our field? Is there risk there? 

How is this defensible? This position in somatics? 
Language is superficial. We have a superficiality problem. 

>To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag]

## Science and the body.
Third person perspective. 
First person perspective. Barrier? Boundary. 

> being a kind of passenger in the body. Appropriating the body from some position of subjectivity - Sam Harris talking to Jay Garfield 23 May 2022 15:33

- Olivia Barry mentions interoception: 
> Rooted in movement and sensory perception, somatics explore the body to accrue interoceptive understanding and homeostatic awareness of the process of embodiment.[@barry-2022-tracing p.253]
- this sentence makes zero sense. what is the 'process of embodiment'?

- Barr and Anderson talk explicitly about link between science and somatics (in unproblematic way) and then how somatics extended beyond its association with science (p.11)
- Barr and Anderson: "However, when returning to Hannaโs definition of somatics in conjunction with such ideas, questions about unspoken implications and consequences surface (Green 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017)"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] -- worth looking at these and how unspoken they are?
- "Somatics is neither a monolith nor a panacea"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] 
- very useful re dance / science -- including citations

## original abstract

A proposal to attend the Somatic Practices Conference, July 2023

> There is a real situation, that can't be denied, but it is too big for any individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and this is a good thing. 

-- Kim Stanley Robinson [-@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices โ and elsewhere in dance scholarship โ artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free [@eddy-2009-briefa p.6], greater physical expression [@batson-2007-revisiting], physical harmony [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259], challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse [@beaudry-2015-somatic], "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" [@fortin-2017-looking p.146], and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learnersโ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]. In this presentation I will map and organise the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. I will then use this map to examine i) _interoception_ as an example of the failure of somatic practices in the arts and humanities to work with scientific discourses and laboratories; and ii) the nature of ideology itself and its value and limitations in helping us understand the role and limits of somatic practices. The presentation will address two themes from the call for proposals: what has been missing in explorations of somatics, and the pressing questions for somatics in the future.

## updated abstract (actually used this one)

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices โ and elsewhere in dance scholarship โ artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free (Eddy 2009), greater physical expression (Batson 2007), physical harmony (Mullan 2014), challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse (Beaudry 2015), "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" (Fortin 2017), and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learnersโ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" (Kampe 2015). In this presentation I discuss the nature of the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices, and what these claims might say about our responsibilities within and beyond dance research. 

## edit bin

> Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky-2012-skill n.pag.]

> In this frame, dance relies on a high degree of specialised and high contact-based training that culminates in performances or financially expensive presentations in specialised venues [...] dance in this context becomes an elite activity within an ecology of 'refined' culture that claims to be rooted in the identity formation of everyday life and, yet, services relatively small sections of the community. (Phillips 2004: 1)  -- [Phillips in @laidlaw-2021-ecological p.97]

- this article by Laidlaw is very good

> Phenomenology, first established by Edmund Husserl, studies consciousness and its embodied processes (Husserl [1900] 1970). Its teachings hold that features of experience appear and transform in consciousness. [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]

- mentions non dual awareness and Dogen Zen [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]


## getting going: a schism and creating a disciplinary identity

In 1994 I started full-time dance training at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne. I was 25 years old. At the same time I was completing a Masters Degree in Kinesiology (mostly Newtonian mechanics) at the University of Otago School of Physical Education in Otago, Aotearoa New Zealand. At the VCA I was given credit for BA-level classes that were called Kinesiology. Yay. I didn't have to go to those classes. It didn't occur to anyone (including me) that there was practically zero cross-over between the Kinesiology I had been studying for 6 years and the Kinesiology that was being taught at the VCA. I tell this story not to establish any scientific credentials on my part. Far from it. Rather, I tell it as an example of the cultural schism between science and art. Ah, but that was nearly 30 years ago I hear you say ... 

In 1997 the somatics philosopher Elizabeth Behnke wrote: 

> somatics is a field that is still in the process of creating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of its history, and searching out an appropriate language for its theory and practice [Behnke, 1997 (p.667) in @barr-2022-illuminating p.17] 

Ah, but that was more than 25 years ago I hear you say ...

Thinking through Ginot's statement that the purpose of science in somatics is to "foster belief" [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#^fd4fbc]]. Linking here with Ingold's [[search for truth]] and the unison of imagination and experience, and of taking ourselves into the world. But how are we failing to do that in somatic practices? Contrast also with [[map and territory]] and my sense is that in the claims we are making we are attempting to construct the territory -- or to colonise the territory from a very small island. Note a very early idea I had in [[zen, map and territory]] in which I describe [[authentic movement]] as a dance with territory or even noumenal experience ([[noumenon and phenomenon]]) -- really really not sure about this last bit. Noting also here the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and practices re 'knowing' the noumenon: [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^e2cbd2]] The Kantian thing seems to be about the un-naming (which is to know the unknowable 'thing in itself'). Non-dual awareness ticks into here -- that when there is no self, the unknowing ceases to be something that one's self can not do.
