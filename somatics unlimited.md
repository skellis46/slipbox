# Somatics Unlimited

_previous note:_ [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]

![[somatics unlimited map.canvas]]

## The things that we say

Here are five claims made on behalf of somatics and drawn from the pages of JDSP. 

> Embodied perspectives can enrich traditional theories and approaches [Meier et al 2012, in @petsilas-2019-embodied p.182]

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

> [Eye contact in Authentic movement] can communicate so many feelings as well as compassion or empathy; it enables a direct meeting from the depths of the souls, without words. [@halstrup-2015-bones p.290]

> By adopting a somatic approach to conducting research, writing, creating art, or engaging in another profession, we become more alive to what touches us and how our work and presence can touch others. [@saumaa-2020-somaticist p.237]

> It is a widely held view that ‘somatics has arrived precisely to resolve the many fragmentations between different forms and disciplines, between theory and practice, education and environment, aesthetics and healing, art, creation and performance, experience and reflection’ [Fernandes 2015: 10, in @donadel-2020-online p.156]

## Making claims

What does it mean to _claim_ something? 

Here are some definitions. As a countable noun a "claim is something which someone says which they cannot prove and which may be false" [@noauthor-nodate-claim]. In the US in particular, a claim is loosely used as a synonym for contend, maintain or assert [@noauthor-2022-claim]. To claim something is also to "assert and demand recognition" or possession of something. And lastly, by definition, when we say someone claims something, we imply doubt [@noauthor-nodate-claim]. 

What a claim is not is an argument.

> Claims backed by reasons that are supported by evidence are called arguments. [@nordquist-2020-what n.pag.]

A claim without evidence is simply an opinion or _assertion_. 

And so I have used the word _claim_ because while reading JDSP over the years I started to see a tendency or pattern -- a pattern of unsubstantiated assertions about the value and currency of somatic practices: that somatics have unlimited value, scope, and power to produce change. We -- and by we I mean those of us who contribute to the journal -- we seem fine to say pretty much whatever we like about the effects and benefits of somatic practices. It is barely believable from an insider's perspective, and one can only imagine how it might seem from the outside.  

In doing this work I do not seek to shame our field or tear it down. If anything, I see myself as a believer in the transformative powers of somatic practices: I have experienced their benefits, and continue to practice a version of authentic movement as a fundamental approach to understanding movement, sensation and consciousness. Rather, I want to understand the epistemic values of somatic practices as represented by the materials published in JDSP and what these values say about our community of practice and scholarship.

## An unfinished catalogue of claims

And so, late last year, I started something that I have not yet finished. I started cataloguing every claim made on behalf of somatic practices in the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. 

I haven't yet finished this cataloguing effort because I ran out of time. In fact, I didn't get close. To date (2022 V14.2), 271 articles have been published in JDSP. This number excludes editorials, reports, book reviews and volume 14.1S (translations of Martha Eddy's 2009 history), but includes interviews and editorials for special issues which were fuller than regular editorials. To this date I have only read and worked through 85 of these 271, which is just shy of a third of them. "Piss poor effort". I worked from both the beginning and the end of the journal so the articles most poorly represented by my analysis come from the middle years 2012 to 2018. 

All of my observations today have emerged from those book-ending articles from the JDSP database. 

## Two methodological concerns

### Cherry picking

My assumption is that researchers are all (more or less) guilty of cherry-picking. We seek examples that confirm our beliefs or ideas and ignore examples that contradict or are contrary to these beliefs. I don't think we do this deliberately or consciously, but we do do it. Cherry picking is also known as the fallacy of incomplete evidence, and in science it is an epistemological characteristic of denialism. 

To this end, I have tried to mitigate against cherry picking. For instance, I randomly selected 20 articles from the 272 and then worked my way down that selection to include as examples this morning. For example, the list of quote-claims I presented at the beginning were drawn -- one each -- from the first five randomly selected articles. This randomised process is to avoid claims that I have cherry picked examples, but it also indicates just how common the following observations are in the JDSP corpus. You might argue (fairly) that I even developed a bias to notice such claims and drawing articles at random is a simple attempt to reduce that kind of confirmation bias. 

The other thing is that I had to introduce this randomisation as a result of not completing my analysis in time. And later, after a conversation with the dance philosopher Anna Pakes, it became clear to me that a more rigorous linguistic analysis of the JDSP corpus would be ideal for this kind of analysis. But that's a different presentation. 

### Motivated reasoning

Thinking about motivated reasoning (introduce it briefly -- example of female cigarette smokers?) --- but what other approaches might there be: cynical, caring, curiosity (approaches to how I understand my experience of reviewing these articles)

You might (rightly) question my values here or attempt to understand what might be in it for me. What are the motivations for my reasoning? I can say I am worried. I worry for what this pattern might mean for our field -- a field that I am indebted to, that is fundamental to my practice (as artist-scholar) and that deeply nourishes how I participate in the world. 

- noting that all these steps backwards take time and effort -- to discuss cherry picking, to talk about my motivations, to attempt to be transparent about the methods even for this simple analysis this morning. This effort is a low research bar, but it is also I think (or perhaps hope), rigorous -- a word that seems to have gone out of favour, at least in the disciplines in which I am most closely aligned. 

## Six observations

### Ubiquity (define your terms)

There is remarkable range of practices presented either directly or indirectly (by virtue of being in JDSP) as somatic: 

- movement
- body-mind awareness
- RSVP cycles
- somatics ethnography
- play and dance improvisation
- eukinetics and choreutics
- somatic nature of costume
- felt sense of touch in Argentine tango duet
- kinesthetic watching
- dancing with roots, dirts, trees
- vocal sounding
- hybrid somatic practices
- eco-somatic practices: dancing-singing
- public eco-somatic programmes
- mindful movement
- acroyoga
- spinning practice

Some of these practices are newly coined, some more familiar. Most are poorly described as to what they are in practice in ways that would be recognisable for those not already in the know. The descriptions often contain highly abstract terms. 

Here's an example. It's a strange example but it was the next cab off my randomised rank, and it concerns the _somatic practice_ of the plié. 

> A plié is a bend of the knees. Pliés can be done in many different positions: first, second, third, fourth: open and crossed fifth, and parallel. In all cases, the left and right knees bend equally, although certain position of the feet, like fourth open, cause a slightly uneven distribution of weight – making the achievement of even-ness in the knee-bend very challenging.[@deleon-2009-potent p.90]

Let's take a look. What is a position? What is crossed fifth? What is parallel? Regarding the distribution of weight, does this mean if I bend my knees while lying down (or with my legs in the air while on my back) that this is not a plié or knee-bend? Who then is this writing for other than people who already know (and perhaps believe) in this work? 

So here I observe and acknowledge the ubiquity of the term somatics -- which is not surprising given I am talking about JDSP -- and the challenge to precisely describe what these practices are. The lack of precision (and the weight of abstractions) is telling even with those practices that have a TM next to their name. 

The eighteenth-century French philosopher Voltaire wrote simply:

> Define your terms ... or we shall never understand one another.[@mitchell-2019-artificial loc 286]

There is tremendous responsibility in owning and clarifying our abstractions. Vagueness and abstraction go hand in hand, and "extraction follows closely on the heels of abstraction" [@mcquillan-2022-resisting n.pag.] And with extraction comes exploitation. Now you could just say, "It's just a bloody plié Simon" and I would understand. But even in such a benign example who and what might we be exploiting through our abstractions, even if the exploitation is an epistemic space? 

Alfred North Whitehead warned that a corollary of abstraction is an effect he called _explaining away_ [Whitehead, in @mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49]. When we treat abstractions as something concrete "everything that does not fit into the schema is denied the status of proper existence" [@mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49] -- it is explained away. Abstractions make invisible anything that does not fit our model of the world. And even in a delightful celebration of the lowly or perhaps fundamental plié the epistemic stakes get very high very quickly.

### Mechanisms are as rare as hens teeth

One of the things I catalogued for the articles I looked at was whether they contained any description of the mechanism for the claims made on behalf of the somatic practice. By "mechanism" I mean some indication of _how_ the somatic practice did what the author said it did. Very few articles in JDSP give mechanisms for how their particular somatics do what they claim to do: about one in five. In most cases, the practice (or practices) are implicitly also the mechanism. In other words, somatic practice x can lead to effect y through the process somatic practice x. 

When articles do contain mechanisms they are often vague OR it's not possible to ascertain if the mechanisms even have anything to do with the somatic practice around which the claim is based. 

Here's an example. It's the next one off my list of randomly selected articles, and is from Vicky Wright's remarkable 2021 (V13:1/2) reflection on _Using mask to explore earlier evolutionary states of sensory awareness, and their role in our inter-relationship with the natural world_ [-@wright-2021-using].

In this I labelled the somatic practice _Phylogenetic mask work_ which I appreciate is not your run-of-the-mill somatic practice. Wright claimed that this mask work:

> can help us to overcome a human/nature alienation and instead create connection.[@wright-2021-using p.203]

There is some sense of mechanism for this effect described by Wright as the "'animal' or 'natural' modes of sensing available to us within our bodies" [@wright-2021-using p.203] and which later in the article she develops as principles. In other words, it is the animal and nature modes of sensing that are _how_ the mask work helps us to overcome human/nature alienation. 

I have lots of questions here, not least how it is that we would know if this mechanism (if indeed it is a mechanism for change) was doing its work, or (more usefully) how would we know if it were not the mechanism for this effect? 

Why does this matter? I mean, if practice x leads to effect y does it matter how, especially if the effect is due to the holistic nature of the practice: something ineffable, unable to be measured, or completely mysterious? I think it matters because if we have no understanding of the mechanisms of change then we don't know which part of a practice is responsible for the changes we seem to be seeing and describing. It's a monumental question really. _How_ does this practice do this? Without this question our claims remain flimsy. They remain simply claims.  

And if I were being horribly provocative I'd drop a philosophical razor into the room. A philosophical razor is a rule of thumb designed to shave off unlikely explanations of phenomena; a time-saving device. Actually, this one is an epistemological razor designed as a rule for rejecting certain knowledge claims. This razor is called Hitchens' razor, created by and named after renowned journalist and atheist Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens' epistemological razor is this: 

> what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. [@hitchens-2007-god p.258]

Hitchens was using the razor in the context of refuting religious belief, but more broadly, what it does is place the burden of proof on the person making the claim. For example, if I claim that somatic practices improves coordination, then it is my responsibility to attempt to provide the evidence to make that argument. 

### Patchwork quilt

I observed that the articles in the journal are mostly individual cells of information that present their own idea oblivious to other practices and debates in the field. It is as if we are -- through the journal -- building a patchwork quilt in which the various (and very different) pieces are waiting to be stitched together, or perhaps are roughly hung together by the acronym JDSP. There are exceptions particularly in the earlier issues, and then later in articles for example by Nuding [-@nuding-2021-approaching] and Laidlaw [-@laidlaw-2021-ecological]. 

I wonder if we could all agree that this patchwork phenomena in JDSP is a thing. We don't have to agree on whether it is a good or bad thing. But that it exists. Perhaps it is a thing because somatics as an artistic-scholarly field is still fledgling? But is it? When might we be ready enough to shed the precarious/new label? I worry that we hide behind it to rationalise this patchwork phenomenon I have observed and am describing. That thinking of ourselves as fledgling is the means by which we get to say what we want, as if someday (in the distant future) these claims will be given the evidence they deserve. 

### Descriptions of practice

The articles that most commonly do NOT make claims are those that are simple descriptions or presentations of practice. For example Whitehead [-@whitehead-2021-stitching], Crisp and Roberts [-@crisp-2021-reflections], Tokunow et al [-@tokunow-2021-stages], Wolfman [-@wolfman-2021-video], and Weber Da Silva et al [-@weberdasilva-2020-am]. It is curious to read these writings and the sense of space they gave me after the feeling of being inundated with claims. It seems that one part of the Journal's role is as a place where current practices are shared. I'll note though -- and this is a particular bug bear of mine [see @ellis-forthcoming-ecosystemic] that rarely are these descriptions of practice drawn into dialogue with other similar or overlapping practices. They are more or less isolated bubbles of practice which likewise contribute to the patchwork I have just discussed. 

### Arguing from authority

With each article I noted the type of somatic practice, the claim itself, the mechanism for the claim, and whether the claim was primary or secondary. 

When I started my hunch was that the claims made on behalf of somatics would veer towards being claims (or appeals) to authority. 

in that it made no reference to research or scholarship by other people.
- by primary source I mean a claim that is uncited. Sometimes the citation is assumed (as if it's a matter of (uncontestable) fact)
- by primary I mean a claim that is not attributed OR has come from the research being presented (vast % is simply an opinion in fact's clothing)

My hunch was that the evidence for claims would be secondary. That the predominance would be arguing from authority. Early on in the journal. But in later volumes not at all. By far we are making primary claims. Almost total lack of mechanisms for these claims. That is, if we say somatics does this, then how does it do this? Perhaps the lack of 'mechanisms' is not surprising. These are (by and large) not the methods we adopt in our work. [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] warned us with her concerns. 

Don't want to simply replicate Ginot's thinking and argument.

- surprising just how little 2º there was -- my hunch was about Anna Pakes' idea
- the circular logic of arguing from authority, or what Ginot describes as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]; i

### Doing the can can

do comparison of how Grau uses the word can -- which is different from 'somatics can'. Quite specific. 

e.g.:

> focusing on the micro-political body through somatic education can help women exercise agency within the matrix of social inequalities they live in. [Fortin, in @fortin-2018-fibromyalgia p.271]

## five provocations

### the case of _can_




### claims of fact and claims of value


> Generally, there are three primary types of claims in an argument, also called persuasive claims:
>  Claims of fact assert that something is true or not true.
>  Claims of value assert that something is good or bad, or more or less desirable.
>  Claims of policy assert that one course of action is superior to another.[@nordquist-2020-what n.pag]

This is important. That without evidence we are just attempting to persuade or convince people. On what grounds might this convincing be happening? To become an argument any persuasive claim must be supported by evidence. 

In JDSP it is as if we are mixing up claims of fact with claims of value.

### debate

> That we test each others’ thinking and collaboratively arrive at standards of epistemic credibility lifts the art of justification beyond the limitations of individual minds, and grounds it in the collective wisdom of reflective and effective communities of inquiry.[@ellerton-2017-how]

- stretch beyond individual (or atomised) claims ... what might our collective wisdom be (as a scholarly and artistic community) and on what grounds can we imagining rejecting a claim, or (at the very least) expressing doubt about it? 

Somatics: how do I disagree? How do we disagree if anything goes? use my viscious cycle of epistemology. Ginot does this ... who are the others?

> An academic claim--a claim you make in an argument--is considered debatable or up for inquiry. - Nordquist, readwise 

-- but where and when are the debates happening?

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity

### ideology and beliefs

overdetermination: “occurs when a single-observed effect is determined by multiple causes, any one of which alone would be sufficient to account for ("determine") the effect” — looking at definition of overdetermination -- it's like somatics is the opposite. A single thing responsible for every effect - but not clear what that single thing is. Certainly appears closer to underdeterminism: Evidence we have is not sufficient to know what to believe. Relates here more to biases -- that is, we already know what to believe, we are just making things fit into those belief systems. This is ideology.

> Consider again the nature of ideology, that necessary thing, which allows us to sort out the massive influx of information we experience. Could ideology also be a cognitive illusion, a kind of necessary fiction? [@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag.]

- from Ministry for the future.
- Somatics as ideology. Making sense. See also earlier parts in book (Ministry for the future?) about ideology.
- beliefs

> The sincerity of one’s belief, the volume or frequency with which it is stated, or assurances to “believe me” should not be rationally persuasive by themselves.[@ellerton-2017-how]

The fallacy of appeal to authority (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/argument/#Fall)
Also _Argumentation as an epistemic practice_ -- relates to Nordquist above (but compare with confirmation bias, and the backfire effect! -- motivated reasoning):

> In particular, arguments that threaten our core beliefs and our sense of belonging to a group (e.g., political beliefs) typically trigger all kinds of motivated reasoning (Taber & Lodge 2006; Kahan 2017) whereby one outright rejects those arguments without properly engaging with their content. Relatedly, when choosing among a vast supply of options, people tend to gravitate towards content and sources that confirm their existing opinions, thus giving rise to so-called “echo chambers” and “epistemic bubbles” (Nguyen 2020). Furthermore, some arguments can be deceptively convincing in that they look valid but are not (Tindale 2007; see entry on [fallacies](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fallacies/)). Because most of us are arguably not very good at spotting fallacious arguments, especially if they are arguments that lend support to the beliefs we already hold, engaging in argumentation may in fact _decrease_ the accuracy of our beliefs by persuading us of false conclusions with incorrect arguments (Fantl 2018). <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/argument/#Fall>

They become truisms. A word like that? 

- seems like these are closer to the level of myths or beliefs. Even hopes, wishes or desires. 

Thinking through Ginot's statement that the purpose of science in somatics is to "foster belief" [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#^fd4fbc]]. 

### methods and superficiality

- there's a bigger question about how we find things out. A question of method. how is it that we come to make this claim? methods are discipline specific. JDSP is full of many many kinds of methods: scientific interventions, ethnography, practice research, phenomenology, various qualitative practices (some with content analysis, some more akin to case studies) dance analysis, reflections, descriptions, various combinations of these. Many unstated. That is, it's not so clear how the writer got to say the things they are saying. Opinion. 
- where is place for the 'rational' in this conversation? 
- how might each of us justify the things we say? 

- most of these claims are not falsifiable -- but calling on that word (and the legacy of Karl Popper) is likely troubling in this context, or at the very least unfashionable. What do we have to do to the practices to make them accountable to methods that value falsifiability? (Popper's falsifiability principle or razor: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable. (wikipedia) -- but )
- these beliefs are sincere. We repeat them often. But sincerity and repetition are not the grounds by which we build an expansive understanding on the limits of somatic practices. 
- is there value in suspending belief? (and our convictions). What might scepticism be worth to our field? Is there risk there? 

How is this defensible? This position in somatics? 
Language is superficial. We have a superficiality problem. 


## final thought: decidedly epistemic concerns

- Hetty: other fields similar to somatics? what about music (re making claims)

- backfire effect vs confirmation bias: how do you respond to this?
- how certain do I feel about these being systemic problems in somatics? Clearly my evidence is partial -- and not nearly as rigorous as I would have liked it to be. But it's also not nothing. You might say the exit polls are not looking good for us, but there's still a glimmer of hope. 
- [[pascal's wager]] very useful here:

A philosophical argument related to probability theory in which the cost of being wrong far exceeds the cost of being right. If I am wrong then no harm done -- we enter debate etc. But if I am right the potential cost to our discipline is high. More 'rationale' to assume I am right (to bet on that), if being rational has anything to do with doing research in somatic practices. Use Pascal and god. 

- are these concerns systemic in our field differently from how they are in other fields? That is, is somatic practices peculiar in how 

>To the extent that critical thinking is about analysing and evaluating methods of inquiry and assessing the credibility of resulting claims, it is an epistemic endeavour.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag]

> One of the clearest ways to understand critical thinking is as applied epistemology. Issues such as the nature of logical [inference](https://www.thoughtco.com/inference-logic-term-1691165), why we should accept one line of reasoning over another, and how we understand the nature of evidence and its contribution to decision making, are all decidedly epistemic concerns.[@ellerton-2017-how n.pag.]

- "decidedly epistemic concerns" is a very useful term. These are the stakes and the more we enter an age of fake news, of filter bubbles (which large language models are only going to exacerbate) the more we become responsible for turning claims into arguments and building a stronger community of debate.

> In cases when the artist thinks they know, their interpretation may not be accurate or the whole story. We live in a mysterious world full of uncertainties. And we regularly make assumptions to explain them. Coming to terms with the complexity of our human experience allows us to exit our natural state of confusion. To survive. Generally our explanations are guesses. These vague hypotheticals become fixed in our minds as fact. We are interpretation machines, and this process of labeling and detaching is efficient but not accurate. We are the unreliable narrators of our own experience. [@rubin-2023-creative Location 1813]

## original abstract

A proposal to attend the Somatic Practices Conference, July 2023

> There is a real situation, that can't be denied, but it is too big for any individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and this is a good thing. 

-- Kim Stanley Robinson [-@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free [@eddy-2009-briefa p.6], greater physical expression [@batson-2007-revisiting], physical harmony [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259], challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse [@beaudry-2015-somatic], "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" [@fortin-2017-looking p.146], and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]. In this presentation I will map and organise the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. I will then use this map to examine i) _interoception_ as an example of the failure of somatic practices in the arts and humanities to work with scientific discourses and laboratories; and ii) the nature of ideology itself and its value and limitations in helping us understand the role and limits of somatic practices. The presentation will address two themes from the call for proposals: what has been missing in explorations of somatics, and the pressing questions for somatics in the future.

## updated abstract (actually used this one)

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free (Eddy 2009), greater physical expression (Batson 2007), physical harmony (Mullan 2014), challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse (Beaudry 2015), "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" (Fortin 2017), and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" (Kampe 2015). In this presentation I discuss the nature of the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices, and what these claims might say about our responsibilities within and beyond dance research.

## edit bin

from Wright example above: I say "simply by chance" because it was rare -- I estimate less than a quarter of the articles I reviewed -- for articles to include the mechanisms by which the somatic practices functioned.

But other descriptions of practice go into claim mode ... - ones that are descriptive of process make fewer claims. Vital role -- in knowing. But rarely if ever (as I've written about elsewhere) talk about similar practices. Isolated bubbles.
- also how many are just sharing practice -- not a comment. These might make no claims at all (just describe it) all the way to overselling the hell out of it

- noting how differently I feel when no claims are made. Mostly I felt relief. That I am left to invest so differently (but also feel a little lost -- like watching art). How art (for the most part) doesn't make claims. 
- surprising number of simply descriptive accounts of practice. No claims. Refreshing. 

### The subjective to the general

> I think I was asking about whether you were recording claims about people's specific experiences (eg. My engagement with a somatic practice achieves…for me) or general claims (somatic practices/BMC/SRT etc achieves….). (Hetty Blades)
- my sense here is that the language makes the distinction tricky. There is slippage from the subjective to the general without acknowledging the shift. Give example.
- on what grounds do each of us get to say the things we say (Hetty's note about specific vs general is useful here). Examples of descriptions of practice are perhaps most intriguing. Make no claims but rather are sharing what work is happening.


- see also  re abstractions: "denied the status of proper existence":

> In a similar way, the operations of AI depend on datafication: the presentation of the world as data separated out from the continuity of experience. Unfortunately, one corollary of abstraction is the effect that philosopher of science Alfred North Whitehead criticized as ‘explaining away’: by treating abstractions as something concrete, everything that does not fit into the schema is denied the status of proper existence (Whitehead, 1997). The error comes from treating abstractions as more real than phenomena. This kind of reified abstraction is a key mechanism of instrumental rationalities like AI – the trick that allows it to see only that which can be made useful and ignore the rest.[@mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49]


- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness. 

What I did not cherry pick were examples that contradicted my observations. I sought them out. Exception proving rule? Or the possibility of another way? 

although I have drawn examples at random from the entire pool of JDSP articles.

This list is arbitrary really. I pulled the claims from five different articles; the very first five articles I selected at random from the 271 articles that have been published in JDSP since 2009 (up to volume 14.2 in 2022). 

- somatics as anecdotal -- and Ginot's 2010 paper (Erin used the term anecdotal to describe part of Ginot's critique)
- intuitions -- and their value (see Annaka Harris in the edit bin)


### perception of change / change of perception

- what does it mean to be good at somatics? How do we recognise someone who is 'good' at somatics? It's a funny/silly/old question/joke about somatics, but so much of what we can't and can say about somatics rests on the capacity to understand and communicate what it is we are observing/noticing (in ourselves and in others) when doing somatics well. See in [[Zoran Josipovic - Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain#^448a09]] and also note the Varela reference in that blockquote.
- [[measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices]] -- see note re perception of change / change of perception

I am not the first to do this. Isabelle Ginot's remarkable piece of scholarship in Dance Research in 2010

> An intuition is simply the powerful sense that something is true without our having an awareness or an understanding of the reasons behind this feeling - Annaka Harris (useful word to keep in mind)

### Science and the body.

Third person perspective. 
First person perspective. Barrier? Boundary. 

> being a kind of passenger in the body. Appropriating the body from some position of subjectivity - Sam Harris talking to Jay Garfield 23 May 2022 15:33

- Olivia Barry mentions interoception: 
> Rooted in movement and sensory perception, somatics explore the body to accrue interoceptive understanding and homeostatic awareness of the process of embodiment.[@barry-2022-tracing p.253]
- this sentence makes zero sense. what is the 'process of embodiment'?

- Barr and Anderson talk explicitly about link between science and somatics (in unproblematic way) and then how somatics extended beyond its association with science (p.11)
- Barr and Anderson: "However, when returning to Hanna’s definition of somatics in conjunction with such ideas, questions about unspoken implications and consequences surface (Green 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017)"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] -- worth looking at these and how unspoken they are?
- "Somatics is neither a monolith nor a panacea"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] 
- very useful re dance / science -- including citations

Linking here with Ingold's [[search for truth]] and the unison of imagination and experience, and of taking ourselves into the world. But how are we failing to do that in somatic practices? Contrast also with [[map and territory]] and my sense is that in the claims we are making we are attempting to construct the territory -- or to colonise the territory from a very small island (could give examples from those 'science' papers in JDSP (Batson et al is one?) which seem to be saying "you need to listen to us") 

> also refer to the validation methods of phenomenology and Buddhist practices saying it ‘[...] is derived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience and self-understanding’ (Varela et al. 1991: xix), a validation that also applies to somatic practices, given that it can only be measured from the observation of changes perceived by the individuals directly involved in the experience. [@silvagrebler-2020-reflection p.18]

- is this the issue -- "can only be measured"? But does that mean we get to say anything we want about it? 

Note a very early idea I had in [[zen, map and territory]] in which I describe [[authentic movement]] as a dance with territory or even noumenal experience ([[noumenon and phenomenon]]) -- really really not sure about this last bit. Noting also here the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and practices re 'knowing' the noumenon: [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^e2cbd2]] The Kantian thing seems to be about the un-naming (which is to know the unknowable 'thing in itself'). Non-dual awareness ticks into here -- that when there is no self, the unknowing ceases to be something that one's self can not do. 


In 2010, the dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner, Isabelle Ginot wrote a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. The article is called _From Shusterman’s Somaesthetics to a Radical Epistemology of Somatics_ [@ginot-2010-shusterman] and in it Ginot asks some difficult questions of somatic practices. _adjust this paragraph to focus on epistemological critique of Ginot's._ withering critique in the role of science to validate the "highly individualized"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15] experiences of somatic practices. 

It is the most sustained and well argued critique of somatic practices scholarship I have happened across (although also enjoyed Elise Nuding in Volume 13 of JDSP)

- dig deeper into the kinds of claims I was looking for -- need clarity here -- see Hetty's comments



(I would guess that as of now it is the journal I have read most in my scholarly life, perhaps along with IJSD and CHOR -- but then I've co-edited those journals) I think 

There is a philosophical razor -- and a razor is a rule of thumb designed to shave off unlikely explanations of phenomena; a time-saving device. Actually, it's an epistemological razor designed as a rule for rejecting certain knowledge claims. This razor is called Hitchens' razor, created by and named after renowned journalist and aetheist Christopher Hitchens. Hitchens' epistemological razor is this: 

> what can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. [@hitchens-2007-god p.258]

Hitchens was using the razor in the context of refuting religious belief, but more broadly, what it does is place the burden of proof on the person making the claim. For example, if I claim that somatic practices improves coordination, then it is my responsibility to provide the evidence to make that argument. This is clear: 


- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity

- - useful summary at beginning of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] -- describes pedagogic, better (more virtuosic) dancing, injury prevention and rehab
-  leavened by occasional humility or caution: "sometimes overzealous and too narrowly optimistic stances towards somatics" (written as a counter to this)[@fortin-2017-looking p.146]

- could go through this one to group some claims together:
> The efficiency and benefits of applying somatic methods or practices to dance training have also been explored (Green 1999; Batson 2007; Eddy 2009).[@sen-podstawska-2022-moving p.52] 

- can say what most number of claims was in single article
- percentage of 1º vs 2º

Fortin (other examples and what they might tell us -- cf with the one above). So, although the Fortin article was selected at random I chose the following claim in my initial set of five to you today:

> these [somatic] practices can refine bodily perceptions, which can contribute to improvement of technique, aid the development of expressive capacities and prevention of injuries. [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

When I could have presented the following:

> Feldenkrais Method of somatic education allowed [them] to develop an internal authority which made them less vulnerable to the health impacts of the dominant dance discourse. [@fortin-2009-experience p.60]

I have some issues with Fortin's methods, but at least this statement is grounded in evidence gained through an action-research process (working with undergraduate dance students). 

- title "somatics unlimited" was based on a hunch. method is fragile because of this hunch. confirmation bias. to guard against it (if that's even possible)

- ain't nothing wrong with claims -- it's more the type/kind that I think is worth discussing (or is it my perception of the quantity?)

It is an extraordinary list even if perhaps it's also a little unfair on my part to pluck them out of context and put them next to each other like this:

[[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

I think by using the word _claim_ I've shown my hand more than a little. The word implies that I have adopted suspicious eyes. I did not, for instance, attempt to catalogue the arguments or _facts_ in JDSP, and it's important to remember that there are arguments in its pages, as there are facts. For example, of the five I have just shown you, the one by Sylie Fortin is more than a claim. Here it is again: 

> Feldenkrais Method of somatic education allowed [them] to develop an internal authority which made them less vulnerable to the health impacts of the dominant dance discourse. [@fortin-2009-experience p.60]

> Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky-2012-skill n.pag.]

> In this frame, dance relies on a high degree of specialised and high contact-based training that culminates in performances or financially expensive presentations in specialised venues [...] dance in this context becomes an elite activity within an ecology of 'refined' culture that claims to be rooted in the identity formation of everyday life and, yet, services relatively small sections of the community. (Phillips 2004: 1)  -- [Phillips in @laidlaw-2021-ecological p.97]

- this article by Laidlaw is very good

> Phenomenology, first established by Edmund Husserl, studies consciousness and its embodied processes (Husserl [1900] 1970). Its teachings hold that features of experience appear and transform in consciousness. [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]

- mentions non dual awareness and Dogen Zen [@fraleigh-2021-body p.114]


## getting going: a schism and creating a disciplinary identity

In 1994 I started full-time dance training at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne. I was 25 years old. At the same time I was completing a Masters Degree in Kinesiology (mostly Newtonian mechanics) at the University of Otago School of Physical Education in Otago, Aotearoa New Zealand. At the VCA I was given credit for BA-level classes that were called Kinesiology. Yay. I didn't have to go to those classes. It didn't occur to anyone (including me) that there was practically zero cross-over between the Kinesiology I had been studying for 6 years and the Kinesiology that was being taught at the VCA. I tell this story not to establish any scientific credentials on my part. Far from it. Rather, I tell it as an example of the cultural schism between science and art. Ah, but that was nearly 30 years ago I hear you say ... 

In 1997 the somatics philosopher Elizabeth Behnke wrote: 

> somatics is a field that is still in the process of creating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of its history, and searching out an appropriate language for its theory and practice [Behnke, 1997 (p.667) in @barr-2022-illuminating p.17] 

Ah, but that was more than 25 years ago I hear you say ...
