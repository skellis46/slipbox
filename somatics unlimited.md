Somatics: how do I disagree? How do we disagree if anything goes? Ginot does this ... who are the others? 

> 	There is a real situation, that can't be denied, but it is too big for any individual to know in full, and so we must create our understanding by way of an act of the imagination. So we all have an ideology, and this is a good thing. 

-- Kim Stanley Robinson [-@robinson-2020-ministry n.pag]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices – and elsewhere in dance scholarship – artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in making claims about the benefits of somatic practices. Such claims are endemic and appear unlimited in scope: becoming pain free [@eddy-2009-briefa p.6], greater physical expression [@batson-2007-revisiting], physical harmony  [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259], challenging the "dominant discourses" re sexual abuse [@beaudry-2015-somatic], "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies" [@fortin-2017-looking p.146], and "a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]. In this presentation I will map and organise the claims made on behalf of somatic practices through the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices. I will then use this map to examine i) _interoception_ as an example of the failure of somatic practices in the arts and humanities to work with scientific discourses and laboratories; and ii) the nature of ideology itself and its value and limitations in helping us understand the role and limits of somatic practices. The presentation will address two themes from the call for proposals: what has been missing in explorations of somatics, and the pressing questions for somatics in the future.

## new notes re presentation

- have bowl of journal articles and grab just four. 

See [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#opportunities]] for useful things to add at end of this presentation.

- the circular logic of arguing from authority, or what Ginot describes as endogenous somatics discourses [@ginot-2010-shusterman]; i

- why has this (of just saying stuff about benefits/effects of somatics) pattern occurred? What does it say about our field? And about us? Circularity
- Ginot key
- noting that in most cases the practice (or practices) implicitly are also the mechanism -- noting here wholistic work
- benefit/effect -- out of context some sound very absurd. Some sound quite absurd in context. not wanting to shame. playfulness. 
- ubiquity of term 'somatics' (not a surprise given I was looking at JDSP) -- but certainly the lack of precision is telling. That it is a catch-all. But what is it a catchall of? 
- Olivia Barry mentions interoception: 
> Rooted in movement and sensory perception, somatics explore the body to accrue interoceptive understanding and homeostatic awareness of the process of embodiment.[@barry-2022-tracing p.253]
- this sentence makes zero sense. what is the 'process of embodiment'?
- left out editorials from my collection -- mostly descriptive

- by primary source I mean a claim that is uncited. Sometimes the citation is assumed (as if it's a matter of (uncontestable) fact)
- Barr and Anderson talk explicitly about link between science and somatics (in unproblematic way) and then how somatics extended beyond its association with science (p.11)
- Barr and Anderson: "However, when returning to Hanna’s definition of somatics in conjunction with such ideas, questions about unspoken implications and consequences surface (Green 2015; Alexander and Kampe 2017)"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] -- worth looking at these and how unspoken they are?
- "Somatics is neither a monolith nor a panacea"[@barr-2022-illuminating p.12] 
- very useful re dance / science -- including citations

> In 1997 somatics philosopher Elizabeth Behnke wrote: ‘[s]omatics is a field that is still in the process of creating a disciplinary identity, retrieving the threads of its history, and searching out an appropriate language for its theory and practice’ (1997: 667). [@barr-2022-illuminating p.17] 
- can say what most number of claims was in single article
- percentage of 1º vs 2º
- mechanism -- why does it matter? If it works, who cares how? 
- list the various practices/names/langauge in column b
- noting how practice and mechanism are almost exclusively the same thing

> The efficiency and benefits of applying somatic methods or practices to dance training have also been explored (Green 1999; Batson 2007; Eddy 2009).[@sen-podstawska-2022-moving p.52] 

- if mentioned the same benefit more than once in same article, listed them all

- what does it mean to be good at somatics? How do we recognise someone who is 'good' at somatics? It's a funny/silly/old question/joke about somatics, but so much of what we can't and can say about somatics rests on the capacity to understand and communicate what it is we are observing/noticing (in ourselves and in others) when doing somatics well. See in [[Zoran Josipovic - Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain#^448a09]] and also note the Varela reference in that blockquote.

Thinking through Ginot's statement that the purpose of science in somatics is to "foster belief" [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence#^fd4fbc]]. Linking here with Ingold's [[search for truth]] and the unison of imagination and experience, and of taking ourselves into the world. But how are we failing to do that in somatic practices? Contrast also with [[map and territory]] and my sense is that in the claims we are making we are attempting to construct the territory -- or to colonise the territory from a very small island. Note a very early idea I had in [[zen, map and territory]] in which I describe [[authentic movement]] as a dance with territory or even noumenal experience ([[noumenon and phenomenon]]) -- really really not sure about this last bit. Noting also here the differences between Eastern and Western philosophy and practices re 'knowing' the noumenon: [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics#^e2cbd2]] The Kantian thing seems to be about the un-naming (which is to know the unknowable 'thing in itself'). Non-dual awareness ticks into here -- that when there is no self, the unknowing ceases to be something that one can not do. 


> also refer to the validation methods of phenomenology and Buddhist practices saying it ‘[...] is derived from its ability to transform progressively our lived experience and self-understanding’ (Varela et al. 1991: xix), a validation that also applies to somatic practices, given that it can only be measured from the observation of changes perceived by the individuals directly involved in the experience. [@silvagrebler-2020-reflection p.18]

- is this the issue -- "can only be measured"? But does that mean we get to say anything we want about it?
