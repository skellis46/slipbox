# planetary time becomes visible

_previous note:_ [[how to think humanity as geologic and vice versa]]

> After humans have extracted and released geologic reserves from the earth for centuries, planetary time becomes irrefutably visible. GHG emissions might be additive from an atmospheric perspective, but they are subtractive from a geospheric one. The most mundane acts that one performs—taking a flight or eating vegetables—require devouring the prehistoric as materialized in hydrocarbon deposits and aquifers. To put it in literary scholar Michael Ziser’s more numinous terms, “Our Western bodies, homes, communities, governments, arts, and ideologies are—in a sense that is still mysterious and infrequently spoken of— expressions of the mystical surplus of energy that is fossil fuel.”22 Merely existing in late-capitalist modernity places one in a historical present of extracting, processing, and consuming hydrocarbons. The Anthropocene then concatenates the enduring geologic past and long present and, rhetorically, orients toward a degraded future to be averted or an alternative one to be realized.

- really taken by that phrase "mystical surplus of energy that is fossil fuel"

- [[the geologic time scale travels in one direction]]
