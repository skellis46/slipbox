# emergence

_previous note:_ [[harris - conscious]]

> A phenomenon that is not predicted by the constituent parts, and is more complex than the sum of its parts, is referred to as an emergent phenomenon. [@harris-2019-conscious LocationÂ 645]

> An emergent property of a system, in this context, is one that is not a property of any component of that system, but is still a feature of the system as a whole. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence)
