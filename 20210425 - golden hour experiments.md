# 20210425 - golden hour experiments

## premise

Went early to site to get a feel for camera white balance settings at golden hour (arrived 5:45am. Shot most of the footage at: 1080p, 120fps, N FoV, 4000k (or was it 3k?), GoPro Color, shutter: Auto, ISO: 400, Sharpness: Low, EV Compensation: -0.5.

Note, at 49_GOPR8131.MP4 I changed WB to Native. What I can't remember is what I shot first images at. I'm pretty sure it was white balance 4000k. So frustrating not to have noted this clearly. 


## footage collected

- 28_GOPR8110.MP4
- 29_GOPR8111.MP4 - tried rotating with camera (too dark -- actually, I don't know. Is it? It's pretty special the colour), but worth repeating #ideatotry Also some amazing footage of the sky right towards end of clip (with my face in shot)
- 30_GOPR8112.MP4 - lots of great hand footage here. Beautiful purple-ish hue (highlighted or exaggerated by my purple top). Got me thinking about the differences between the hand (XCU) footage and the 'flying' footage. See marker "amazing circular flight" on this clip -- and also the way it goes directly to black at impact. Wondering about the way blackness might be used in the film (maybe thinking in relation to [[20210407 - he is painfully aware (2nd edit)]]), and also to heighten the impact/feel of the audio. Or to go to complete silence in darkness, then slowly 'come to life' -- see 05:29:07 of this clip
- 31_GOPR8113.MP4 - short clip of me checking the camera (wearing glasses) -- little sneak of airplane fuel in one corner
- 32_GOPR8114.MP4 - amazing footage of airplane **condensation trail** (contrail); more circling of body but this time with no arms in shot. The colour here is amazing. I'd say it was at 6am (or just before) -- so 10-15mins after sunrise. 
- 33_GOPR8115.MP4: 'regular' throwing and catching footage, with extended (and fab) hand footage towards the end (marked in PP)
- 34_GOPR8116.MP4: me frowning at camera (that's all)
- 35_GOPR8117.MP4: mostly hand footage -- I think I'm taking the camera out of the case. Inevitable frowning is me trying to read the settings on the camera!
- 36_GOPR8118.MP4: 
- 37_GOPR8119.MP4
- 38_GOPR8120.MP4
- 39_GOPR8121.MP4
- 40_GOPR8122.MP4
- 41_GOPR8123.MP4
- 42_GOPR8124.MP4
- 43_GOPR8125.MP4
- 44_GOPR8126.MP4
- 45_GOPR8127.MP4
- 46_GOPR8128.MP4
- 47_GOPR8129.MP4
- 48_GOPR8130.MP4
- 49_GOPR8131.MP4 - changed to Native WB at this point (very clear difference in colour of footage)
- 50_GOPR8132.MP4
- 51_GOPR8133.MP4
- 52_GOPR8134.MP4
- 53_GOPR8135.MP4
- 54_GOPR8136.MP4 - fast fast spinning


## thoughts and ideas

At this stage there are five possible 'states':

- throwing and catching
- XCU of hands and other body parts
- parachute
- bumping into tree
- circling with camera e.g. _29_GOPR8111.MP4_

Possibility or idea of using orange survival blanket -- [[20210316 - settings and trees#^36358e]] got me thinking about survival, and sense of GoPro being a survival tool; to hike somewhere (even Richmond Park) and spend the day there. To do the shoot in a day. Dawn to dusk. Unshaven. Survival kit, food. Long lens for wildlife, + lens for XCU. 

## more to do

- build bigger parachute #ideatotry 
- work with string attached to camera #ideatotry 
- think through possible locations (less like a local park? implications?) #ideatotry 
- running and catching (as if it were a cricket ball), also using two hands in different positions #ideatotry 
- use softball glove to catch #ideatotry
