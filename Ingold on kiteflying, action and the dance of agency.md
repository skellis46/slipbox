# Ingold on kiteflying, action and the dance of agency

_previous note:_ [[authentic movement]]

> Nowhere is the dead hand of objectification more clearly at work than in the essay that launched much of the current debate, Alfred Gell’s Art and Agency (1998). Here, the question is explicitly posed as one about the ascription of agency to what Gell does not hesitate to call ‘art objects’. The presumption is that in the making of such objects, intentions initially framed within the mind of the artist are projected onto the material: thus the intention is the cause, the artwork the effect. And the viewer, subsequently observing the work, is supposed to look through the work to the agency within and behind it (Knappett 2005: 128). But as we saw from Simondon’s example of making bricks, introduced in Chapter 2 (pp. 24–25), this scenario focuses on an arbitrary starting point (the image in the artist’s mind) and an equally arbitrary end point (the allegedly finished work), while missing out all that goes on in between. The living work of art, however, is not an object but a thing, and the role of the artist is not to give effect to a preconceived idea but to follow the forces and flows of material that bring the work into being. To view the work is to join the artist as a fellow traveller, to look with it as it unfolds in the world, rather than behind it to an originating intention of which it is the final product (Ingold 2011a: 216). [@ingold-2013-making p.96]

> That all living beings, humans included, are forever ‘immersed in action’ – as the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once put it – from the moment of birth if not before, is not in doubt (Whitehead 1938: 217). All are at sea in the tumult. However, to attribute this action to an agency, of which it is supposed to be the effect, seems [p.97] like putting everything back to front. For only in the retrospective reconstruction of action already undertaken – in tracing it back to a putative point of origin – can we derive the agency that is supposed to have given rise to it. Otherwise put: humans do not possess agency; nor, for that matter, do non-humans. They are rather possessed by action. Karen Barad admits as much when she argues that agency ‘is an enactment, not something that someone or something has’ (Barad 2003: 826)  [@ingold-2013-making pp.96-97]

> As we have seen, the generativity of action is that of animate life itself, and lies in the vitality of its materials. We need a theory not of agency but of life, and this theory must be one – as Barad puts it – ‘that allows matter its due as an active participant of the world’s becoming’ (Barad 2003: 803).  [@ingold-2013-making p.97]

> For material things to be enrolled in cognitive processes, must they already have been rendered in cultural forms? Why should people think with artefacts alone? Why not also with the air, the ground, mountains and streams, and other living beings? Why not with materials? And if cognition is indeed enacted, as Malafouris claims (2004: 59), then how does it differ from life itself? Does thought lie in the interactions between brains, bodies and objects in the world, or in the correspondences of material flows and sensory awareness wherein consciousness, to recall the words of Deleuze and Guattari, is the ‘thought of the matter-flow’ and material ‘the correlate of this consciousness’ (Deleuze and Guattari 2004: 454)? [@ingold-2013-making p.98]

> Mindful of what we were doing, and improvising as we went along, our kite-flying could be reckoned as an instance of what Sheets-Johnstone calls ‘thinking in movement’. This is not to think by means of movement, or to have our thoughts transcribed into movement. Rather, the thinking is the movement: ‘To think is to be caught up in a dynamic flow; thinking is, by its very nature, kinetic’ (Sheets-Johnstone 1998: 486). In the context to which I have just referred, Sheets-Johnstone is speaking of improvisation in dance. Might we suggest, then, that flying a kite is also a kind of dance? Philosopher and sociologist of science Andrew Pickering would certainly agree, having coined the expression ‘dance of agency’ to describe the kinds of back-and-forth engagements with the material world in which humans and non-humans alternately take the upper hand, not just in the conduct of scientific investigations but quite generally (Pickering 2010: 194–195, see Pickering 1995).

> The kite’s flying is surely the combined effect of the flyer, the kite and the air. The dance of agency, it turns out, is a threesome in which each partner acts upon, and is in turn acted upon by, the other two (Figure 7.5). Take away any one partner, and the performance will fail. Even in the air, a kite will not fly without a flyer; even with a flyer, the kite will only fly in the air; even if the flyer is out in the air, there will be no flying without a kite. The air, then, was the missing link that activated the kite, allowing an action potential that was already immanent within it – in its very construction – to be expressed in motion.

> The very idea of agency, as we have seen, is the corollary of a logic of embodiment, of closing things up in themselves. But air cannot be closed. More than any other element, as the philosopher Luce Irigaray reminds us, air is ‘opening itself’ (Irigaray 1999: 8). The flow of air – the wind (anemos), the breath of life – is the very antithesis of embodied agency. [...] Thus even if we allow that in flying a kite, the flyer dances with the air, it cannot be a dance of [p.101] agency. It can only be a _dance of animacy_. And in this dance, flyer and air do not so much interact as correspond. The kite, in effect, sets up a correspondence between the animate movements of the flyer and the currents of the aerial medium in which he or she is immersed. It is not that you need air to interact with a kite; rather, you need a kite to correspond with the air. [@ingold-2013-making pp.100-101]


> In both cases, of pottery and kiteflying, the mindful or attentive bodily movements of the practitioner, on the one hand, and the flows and resistances of the material, on the other, respond to one another in counterpoint. As with any dance this should be read not laterally, back and forth, but longitudinally as a movement in which partners take it in turns to lead and be led or – in musical terms – to play the melody and its refrain. In the dance of animacy, bodily kinaesthesia interweaves contrapuntally with the flux of materials within an encompassing, morphogenetic field of forces. [@ingold-2013-making p.101]
