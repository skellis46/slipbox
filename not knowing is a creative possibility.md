# not knowing is a creative possibility

_previous note:_ [[not knowing and surprise]]

> While emptiness is what’s left when you take away the thoughts and beliefs that you have constructed around an event, not knowing is a way to move in the absence of such thoughts. It’s a creative possibility. Not knowing who you are allows you to meet an event without pretending it is something else—something that happened before. Then you might experience just what is happening: something unpredictable, delightful, dangerous, safe—eating a taco or walking down the street.[@tarrant-2008-bring Introduction n.pag.]
