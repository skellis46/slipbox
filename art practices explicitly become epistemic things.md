# art practices explicitly become epistemic things

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

Towards the end of _The Conflict of the Faculties_, Henk Borgdorff discusses the assessment framework for artist-scholars who have submitted their work to the Journal of Artistic Research. The first element is _intent_, meaning that an artist intends their work to be research. At this point Borgdorff appears to makes an extraordinary claim:

>By [submitting her work to JAR], she asserts that the work is also to be regarded as research. In the context of the peer-reviewed journal, such a claim is subject to intersubjective evaluation. And something exceptional occurs here, in an epistemological and an ontological sense. The work exposed in the Research Catalogue ‘transforms’ (Latour) from an artistic product to an artistic argument, to a potential bearer of knowledge and understanding. At this moment, artworks and art practices explicitly become epistemic things (Rheinberger), exposed as research in order to set our thinking into motion.[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232]

If I understand this correctly Borgdorff is implying that exposure in the Research Catalogue anoints the work as being an epistemic thing. Is this what he means? There is equivocation in that phrase "potential bearer", and then complete certainty in how these practices and artworks "explicitly" become epistemic things. 

Borgdorff writes that the idea of the "intent" criterion is for reviewers to respond to the question, "Does the submission expose practice as research?"[@borgdorff_conflict_2012 p.232] On face value this seems like a very low bar, as if _getting it out there_ is enough. Then, by "exposing" their work in JAR (in the sense of [[an exposition in practice-research]]), Borgdorff states that the artist "inscribes that work, as it were, into the research discourse." 

The problem here is that there is little if any discourse or dialogue with the field. The quantity of [[mesearch]] is overwhelming, and very few artist-scholars seem to engage with i) what other artistic-scholarly practices their work is in conversation with; ii) why their work matters; and iii) to whom does it matter?

Just to note that Borgdorff discusses ontologic and epistemic boundaries on the next page. 


_questions & thoughts:_

- This seems to be like an everyday object being classified or 'viewed' as an object of art once it is displayed in a gallery (think Duchamp: [[epistemic things, technical objects and Duchamp]]). In other words, might it be possible for me to write anything that, once published in JAR, is confirmed as an epistemic thing? What are the limits here? 
- does an epistemic thing simply "set our thinking in motion"? See [[epistemic things are vague]]
- it's as if JAR is an epistemic gatekeeper
- The JAR people are granting entry. They are affording the transition from art to research. But when is art _not_ research? Their answer is implicitly "if it's not published by us". Or rather, it becomes research when it is published by us. 
- I remain wedded to the idea that this question is key: What do I understand differently as a consequence of this practice? Even though others may not witness or notice those differences (as in a repeatable science experiment). I would like to be convinced otherwise though -- that would be a blast.
