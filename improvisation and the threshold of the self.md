# improvisation and the threshold of the self

Improvisation: Threshold of the self
Dance improvisation: threshold of the self

## keywords

improvisation, non-dual awareness, consciousness, flow, 

## abstract

This chapter examines experiences of losing one’s sense of self during the dance and somatic improvisation practice known as authentic movement, focusing on the tangible threshold between _moving_ and _being moved_. It draws on practice-led research undertaken in 2024 by dancer Katye Coe, cognitive scientist L. S. Merritt Millman, research assistant and dancer Michaela Gerussi and artist-researcher Simon Ellis. The writing builds on a mixed dataset of intensive authentic movement sessions, video and photographic documentation, post-improvisation conversations, self-report questionnaires and desk-based research.

At its centre is a phenomenological analysis of the threshold as being a moment in which the mover’s sense of agency and identity undergoes radical transformation. I propose that this threshold marks a shift from the illusion of subject–object dualism toward non-dual awareness, where the feeling or illusion of a discrete self disappears. These experiences seem to share affinities with Csíkszentmihályi’s flow yet the analysis suggests that they are qualitatively different in kind, inviting reconsideration of how consciousness and embodiment interrelate in dance improvisation.

The discussion situates these findings within wider discourse on flow, presence and non-dual awareness, and considers how somatic training acts as an attentional bias, inclining dance and somatic practitioners to overemphasise the body's role in accessing such direct experience. While the research has implications for improvisation as performance, its primary contribution lies in resisting the lure of corporeal reductionism while articulating the possibilities of corporeality as a conduit for non-dual experience – how the body, through movement, reveals ways of being that momentarily dissolve the boundaries of selfhood. 

## key things:
- who is this work in relation to? does it require some kind of lit review? 
- thick description of that experience ... backgrounding of self / direct experiences of bias towards the corporeal (and tension of that bias with the the extent to which we are fundamentally corporeal) - see [[confusing self-consciousness with consciousness]], [[subject-body and object-body]] -- note the 4 layer map at bottom of this: https://chatgpt.com/share/6968cf1e-c378-8003-9fb7-3a1c85adbe76
- different from flow? (what is gained by this difference -- is it really different). different by degree? or kind? This scoping review intriguing: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2025.102605](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2025.102605)
- non dual awareness and consciousness 
	+ the hunch
	+ where did it begin? -- from interoception and self? Meditation -- yes, through Kabat-Zinn and Sam Harris (in particular SH)
- limits of phenomenology -- 

## introduction: Where was I? Who was I? Was I?

The alarm sounds. 

I am brought back to the world. My eyes were closed but I was not asleep. The feeling is akin to being woken up, and there is a brief moment of confusion or even shock before I re-register my surroundings: the room, the light, another person in the space, the silence, gravity; returning to a body I never left. 

This being brought back to the world is not an uncommon or unpredictable experience. When I am practising a form of dance improvisation called [[authentic movement]] it happens every time. And for anyone who has long improvised or practiced in any form -- drawing, music, coding, writing or dance -- I am confident they would recognise this brief description of the departure from there to here. 

Being woken up or disturbed from such an experience is revealing. It reveals that something profound and delicate is happening to that person in which their awareness is not how we commonly or habitually inhabit the world. When we wake, we wake _from somewhere_. 

Where was I before the alarm sounded? Who was I before the alarm sounded? Was _I_ before the alarm sounded?  

This writing is a description and an analysis of what I understand to be a vital and tangible-yet-delicate part of being in a practice that affords the shock and confusion of being _woken up_ from that same practice. I am writing here of the threshold between knowing _one_ is doing the thing and ceasing to be aware that there is a _one_. This interstice and the experience of being on the other side has many names from many traditions, and they are overlapping concepts. In dance improvisation it is described as the difference between "moving and being moved" [@adler-2002-offering p.30] while in cognitive science it is called transient hypofrontality [@dietrich-2003-functional]. In Taoism _wúwéi_ [@slingerland-2003-effortless] or _action without actor_, in Zen _mushin_ [@soho-2012-unfettered] or _no-mind_, and in sport it bears similarities to [[flow]] [@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow] or being in -- or going through -- _the zone_ [@ashe-1975-arthur].[^zone] There is trance, shamanism and ecstasis [@eliade-2004-shamanism; @lewis-2002-ecstatic], the Sufi wajd [@schimmel-1981-mystical], speaking in tongues (glossolalia) [@samarin-1972-tongues], furor poeticus (poetic frenzy) [@dodds-2020-greeks], the Flamenco concept of duende [@garcialorca-2023-finding], and Vodou possession or _being ridden_ [@metraux-1972-voodoo]. In Russian, the word is simply _perezhivanie_, which means experiencing. In the [Dzogchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen) Tibetan Buddhist tradition it is _rigpa_ or pristine awareness -- where awareness recognises itself without interference [@wangyalrinpoche-1998-tibetan]. In Buddhism it is _śūnyatā_ or emptiness -- the open, non-conceptual field of awareness itself that is self-luminous and nondual. 

[^zone]: Story of Arthur Ashe and the twilight zone.

## Nonduality

Although these phenomena and ideas are not precisely the same, what they have in common is the way in which they explicitly or implicitly transgress or interrupt conventional understandings and experiences of a self. The term nonduality or nondual awareness ... -- and then add focus on [[nonduality]]

_Waking Up_ is a software application developed by neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris (who himself is influenced by the Dzogchen tradition) and it contains a large number of meditations, conversations, lectures and practices exploring secular mindfulness. In a brief audio recording called _What is Mindfulness?_ Harris describes the illusion of self and nondual awareness in which the subject-object dichotomy collapses: 

> [...] that when you're truly paying attention to anything what is clear in those moments is that there's no one doing it. Everything is simply happening. Everything is arising on its own – thoughts, intentions, emotions – and vanishing. And this prior condition of consciousness in which all that is happening doesn't itself feel like I. It doesn't feel like a self. And so in that context one speaks and thinks less about mindfulness as a kind of behavior or practice or even state of mind and one tends to speak more about the nature of consciousness itself. [@harris-nodate-what]

- [[consciousness-as-such]]

but how might nonduality (awareness / consciousness) be the object of research through practice? (it's illogical). 

See [[Mehling - Body Awareness a phenomenological inquiry into the common ground of mind-body therapies#^2eb562]] regarding degrees of relationship to body. Akin to only aware of our bodies at certain times (?) but more detailed.

## methods and phenomenology

Need to understand what phenomenology means by 'lived experience'. See Lumo prompt (Proton LLM)

In [[Barbour - Beyond Somatophobia]] she suggests three methods for investigating "lived dance experience": interviewing, creative journaling and dance making [@barbour-2005-somatophobia p.41]. Using phenomenology (along with others) but all gloss over the limits of addressing nonduality through method that is predicated on duality. But this is only a problem if I make a strong enough case for the presence of nonduality; otherwise the limits of phenomenology are irrelevant. 

"We hence see that it is not the presence of explicit thought that distinguishes ego-involved experience from ego-less experience. Instead, this distinction reflects the degree of immersion in activity and so the degree to which explicit awareness of oneself as standing outside that activity is diminished. It is a distinction that is more phenomenological than psychological, having to do with how we experience our own engagement with the world. When we are completely immersed in activity—whether the physical activity of carving an ox or the cognitive activity of thinking about how best to carve that ox—our sense of self, and with it, the experience of the duality of subject and object in experience, vanish. There is only the experience of a flow of activity." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

"Consciousness is in the looking, not in the looked for" [@spira-2008-transparency n.pag.]. In the dancing, when I become a passenger, the _I_ dissolves into the looking and there is no looked for. 



- methods: 
	+ phenomenology -- see [[Krägeloh - Phenomenological Research Fails to Capture the Experience of Nondual Awareness]]
On this point re Krägeloh and the limits of phenomenology:

> However, the thought about Consciousness or Reality is unique amongst all thoughts. When we try to think of Consciousness, it is like looking into a black hole. It is not even black. The mind simply cannot go there. It cannot go to that objectless place because the mind is itself an object. How could an object fit into a space that has no dimensions? [@spira-2008-transparency]
- this is a huge limit

- data
	+ the practice
	+ qualitative self-reporting 
	+ conversations / reflections with KC (post practice) -- not that my agenda was nonduality (but not the threshold). Was more interested (pre starting) in flow/interoception -- can look to some of my documents/emails about this. 
	+ more interviews?  

## flow

From Kronsted email: 

> I think Montero is a good place to start, and some of the literature on meshed architecture will probably work too. Similarly the discussions on "smooth coping" intermix will with the flow debates.

> I find it interesting that much of the literature on "flow" continually adds and subtracts different conditions to the phenomenon. So many different cognitive phenomenon just get lumped together under flow. I think there are many ways of being in the zone.

> These articles might also be of some help:

- Christensen, W., Sutton, J., & McIlwain, D. J. F. (2016). Cognition in Skilled Action: Meshed Control and the Varieties of Skill Experience. Mind & Language, 31(1), 37–66.

- Katen, J. (2021). Competition and Cognition: Theorizing an Autopoietic Pedagogy of Performance within Competitive Dance. Journal of Dance Education, 21(3), 140–148.

## The practice

- introduce [[authentic movement]]. Note that in [[Marcow-Speiser and Franklin - Authentic Movement as a Meditative Practice]] they link AM to meditation

- how things look is NOT important. Indeed it's irrelevant. Separates this work from the ways in which dance is codified, validated, imagined etc

- [[losing oneself - summary of transcripts]]

Inside outside. All consciousness. Eyes closed alerts us to inside more. See [[no boundary between inside and outside]] -- the value/potential of closing eyes, but it's not necessary. Prioritises physical sensation. 

> [To create a dance improvisation] is to create an ongoing present from the world of possibilities at any given moment.[@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga p.399]

> in a dance improvisation, the process of creating is not the means of realizing _a_ dance, it is _the_ dance itself.[@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga p.399] 

That this is an article about dance improvisation is somewhat arbitrary. It could be many other practices that afford insight into the threshold. It is merely the practice of my expertise. But this also provides an opportunity to consider/assess the peculiarities of dance improvisation in this context, and its limits. 

- Sheets-Johnstone (1981) _Thinking in Movement_ [@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga]. Excellent analysis/description of thinking in movement vs thoughts of movement (and how they are distinct). Main idea is that movement itself is a form of thinking—a dynamic, pre-linguistic mode of cognition through which meaning and understanding are generated bodily rather than abstractly.

- Authentic movement, or improvisation that crosses the threshold from “doing” to “being moved”, can be understood as a temporary return to this **semiotic field** — where gesture precedes the self and meaning arises without intention or control. (this is Kristeva's idea, cited in Sheets-Johnstone above). But, like S-J, it is predicated on a self. I suspect S-J also falls into reifying the body. 
- Mary Starks Whitehouse and Janet Adler -- moving and being moved. 
- Adler on AM as mystical practice "the moving body invites an awakening – summoning the human soul toward a return, a reunion with the eternal." [@adler-2015-mandorla p.218]

> At identifiable thresholds, penetration of fear or of awe - of an utter vulnerability – becomes the source of a growing strength. The risk of experiencing the ineffable fear of a death of oneself as one has known oneself to be can become the gateway into a transformation, into new ways of knowing.[@adler-2015-mandorla p.222]

"in all that happens between the experience of duality and unity consciousness" [@adler-2015-mandorla p.226]

- [[Fraleigh - Consciousness Matters]]

## The threshold

> That is why the transitions from the waking state to the dream state and from the dream state to deep sleep, and vice versa, are considered in some spiritual traditions to be such significant opportunities for awakening. [@spira-2008-transparency] 

Not crossing into something but rather leaving something make believe or usefully constructed -- not entering a state. 

or the tiny moment when the transition occurs

- the line between driving and being driven -- the various names for this phenomenon. Brief attempt at this in [[that which doesn't arise and pass away]] and see also [[undistracted non-meditation]] as more help to describe the experience or phenomenon. 

Goldstein -- body being driven. [[body being known]]

Joseph Goldstein sometimes uses **passive-voice meditation instructions** as a deliberate linguistic device to **undermine the sense of a separate observing self** (LLM). Two citations: https://www.danharris.com/p/how-to-get-out-of-your-head-joseph AND https://wisdomexperience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Emtpiness-Course-Lesson-8-Reading.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com 

Is there a 'bardo' in this work. "intermediate state between conditions"
gradual changes but then absolute. dawn/dusk not right -- like the sun is setting and setting then once it's gone complete darkness. Or a gradient like that suggested by [[Josipovic - Implicit–explicit gradient of nondual awareness]]

**metaxis** — being between or betwixt two states.

- Ecstasis: note here:
**Eugene Gendlin (1997). _A Process Model_.** — describes consciousness as _ecstatic_ in the sense of exceeding static subject–object models. (summarised in LLM)

**ECSTASIS / “standing outside oneself.”** The old Greek name for outsideness—religious, aesthetic, athletic—where agency feels displaced and enlarged. The word _ecstatic_ comes from the Greek **ekstasis (ἔκστασις)**, meaning “standing outside oneself” or “displacement.”

On the matter of direct experience: 

> Direct experience precedes the separation of knower and known, observer and observed. At its core is sheer awareness, the feeling of being. It’s with us when we wake up every morning and go to sleep each night. It’s easy to overlook because it’s so close and familiar. We habitually attend to things instead of noticing awareness itself. We thereby miss a crucial precondition of knowing, for without awareness, nothing can show up and become an object of knowledge.[@frank-2024-blinda]

This is a description of being on the other side of the threshold. But the paradox is that it precedes the separation of subject and object. It is not a state. Duality is the state. 

Finish with a very clear description of what the threshold is and what lies on its other side. [[that which doesn't arise and pass away]] is useful here. 


## the context (other literature)


### review of work in dance on the nature of the threshold

I wonder what the role of newness in this work is at all. Does it have a role? Reading Foster (2003): 

> The known also includes an individual body's predisposition to move in patterns of impulses established and made routine through training in a particular dance tradition as well as the body's predilection for making certain kinds of selections from a vocabulary or a sequence of movements. [@foster-2003-taken p.4]

intriguing she writes of contemplating how: 

> That moment of wavering while contemplating how, exactly, to execute an action already deeply known, belies the presence of improvised action.[@foster-2003-taken p.4]

- Foster also discussed the middle voice of "shit happens" (nonactive / nonpassive voicing)

## analysis
- flow -- hunch that there is overlap but that they are not the same
	+ [[Montero - Thought in Action]]  

- **what is consciousness?**
- - see below re 'the placeless place' from Spira and also that it is _here_. 

> After this timeless interval, Consciousness takes the shape of the next appearance and may identify itself with a part of this appearance, a body. In doing so it ‘forgets’ itself and thereby appears to veil itself from itself.[@spira-2008-transparency]

I'm not sure I understand this idea of consciousness forgetting itself. I get how it takes the shape of the next appearance (say, a tingling in my hand). But what is the itself it is veiling itself from? That I identify the tingling as 'consciousness' as a 'thing'?? 

Is the following useful (both re above) and also [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]:

> However, the essence of the experience, a moment of Consciousness knowing itself knowingly, is colourless and transparent, and therefore cannot be remembered. [@spira-2008-transparency] 

"Consciousness bestows its identity exclusively on the body. It believes and feels, “I am the body.”" (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

"This clear seeing is not an intellectual understanding, although it may be formulated provisionally in intellectual terms when required by the current situation. Rather, it is the direct, intimate and immediate knowing of ourselves resting in and as the formless expanse of Presence, and simultaneously dancing in the vibrancy and aliveness of every gesture and nuance of the body, mind and world." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)


"Likewise we do not experience the body in the way we normally conceive it. In fact there is no body as such. There is a series of sensations and perceptions appearing in Consciousness. And from time to time there is a thought or an image of a ‘body, ’ which is considered to be the sum total of all these sensations and perceptions." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

> All experience takes place here. This here is not a physical space. It is the space of Consciousness in which all experiences, including the apparent experience of space, takes place. A distant sound takes place here. The thought that subsequently conceives that sound to be at a distance from the perceiving Consciousness takes place in the same space as the sound itself. It takes place here. The chair on ‘the other side of the room’ is perceived here, in exactly the same place as the sound and the thought, at no distance from Consciousness. All bodily sensations take place in the same placeless place, which is here.[@spira-2008-transparency]

- the above from Spira is clear. These are merely appearances in consciousness. What then is consciousness? (see non-negotiable above). Love that phrase "the placeless place". Also this:

> One perception cannot appear within another. All perceptions appear within Consciousness. We do not experience a sensation inside the body. What we call the body is in fact the experience of a sensation. [@spira-2008-transparency]

- The above is just beautiful -- and head spinning. There are only perceptions appearing in consciousness. That is all. Have as a separate note called [[all perceptions appear within consciousness]]

## the role of training / biases

- movement as a bias. That we in dance are training this bias (indeed this is what training can be thought to be). See also [[everything is becoming otherwise]]. also on this point see Spira below: [[#^b57941]]

> Although this sounds complicated, we are all intimately familiar with the role of precision weighting in perception. Increasing the estimated precision of sensory signals is nothing other than ‘paying attention’. When you pay attention to something – for example, really trying to see whether a gorilla is out there in the distance – your brain is increasing the precision weighting on the corresponding sensory signals, which is equivalent to increasing their estimated reliability, or turning up their ‘gain’. Thinking about attention this way can explain why sometimes we don’t see things, even if they are in plain view, and even if we are looking right at them. [@seth-2021-being] 

> If we think that we know something objective about ourselves or the world, then whatever that something is that we think we know, will condition our subsequent enquiry into the nature of experience.[@spira-2008-transparency] ^b57941

This is essential also in relation to training biases

- From Hetty in November 2024: what is the role of movement? (this is a key question re [[Seth and Tsakiris - Being a Beast Machine]] and the 'bias' of movement for dancers )

## the principles

- Taoism: wu wei -- Alan Watts "not forcing" ([Alan Watts - The Principle Of Not Forcing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzaUGhhnlQ8). 17 July 2018. [Archived](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/ZzaUGhhnlQ8) from the original on 2021-12-22 – via www.youtube.com). He said  "The river is not pushed from behind, nor is it pulled from ahead. It falls with gravity." (Watts, Alan (March 1974). _Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown_. Pantheon Books). Also Slingerland "trying not to try" (book)

- the principles of allowing this experience 
	+ not wanting 
	+ not forcing
	+ not judging 
- there is a lot of information in the [[losing oneself 2024 practice]] page including annotated bibliography

- indifference vs non-judgement: 

> Sooner or later Consciousness comes to see the difference between its own openness, its own Presence, which welcomes all things into itself with benevolent indifference, and a mind which, by definition, sees differences and yet has imposed on itself a straitjacket of ‘nonjudging.’ Such ‘non-judging’ comes from fear and confusion. It is not the true, benevolent indifference of Presence.[@spira-2008-transparency]

## collected quotes

on what kind of awareness is it? (unconstructed):

> Our results lend further evidence to the claims that NDA meditations are different from both FA and OM meditations. While FA and OM meditations are traditionally regarded as “constructed” states created through deployment of speciﬁc attentional strategies, NDA meditations are thought not to involve intentional effort, but to be based on identifying a reﬂexive awareness that is regarded as “unconstructed” (Mipam and Hopkins, 2006). Additionally, both FA and OM meditations are content-oriented, concerned with the speciﬁcs of experience, while NDA meditations could be seen as primarily context-oriented, concerned with the context of experience. [@josipovic-2012-influence]

> When the world dissolves at the end of a perception, Consciousness recognises itself, and this recognition is called Beauty. The words Understanding, Happiness, Love and Beauty are all synonyms for Consciousness, for ‘I.’ They do not refer to objects. [@spira-2008-transparency]
- above is kind of why it matters -- is it? (or perhaps that's in therapeutic sense)

Wonder if [[bodily sensation and behaviour influence emotions]] is useful as a "future thinking" or 'why it matters' component.

I like the following description of the self by Sacasas. It's for another context, but useful as reminder of the fluidity of our identification with _a_ self? 

> Put that way it doesn’t seem like an especially profound point. Indeed, it seems rather obvious. The self is not exactly fixed. It undoubtedly evolves over time, it is multi-faceted, and, critically, it escapes our full comprehension. All of this said, it seems to me that our experience of the self can range across a spectrum from more free-floating to more anchored. In these examples, people act as anchors. And, to be more precise, what we are being anchored to is some segment of our own past.[@sacasas-2022-stuff]

- [[Vo - Some Hypotheses on Being Possessed]] - this is fascinating and I wonder if any overlap with [[Waldenfels - Phenomenology of the Alien]]

> They argue that the accumulation function in the posterior insula might be correlated with the encoding of time intervals as suggested by Craig (2009a,b). Craig’s model proposes a close interaction between interoceptive processes and time perception, suggesting that our experience of time emerges from emotional and visceral states processed in the insular cortex. It can be interpreted as a series of global emotional moments that are indexed across a finite period of present time, from the past into the anticipated future. These series produce a cinemascopic “image” of the sentient self that is continuous across a moving window of present time. [@herbert-2012-body] 
- thinking about time and flow and consciousness --

> Attention is Consciousness with an object. When the object vanishes, attention simply remains what it always is, Consciousness [@spira-2008-transparency]

- can I make an argument here about the body during improvisation as a special kind of object [[an object of special regard]]?? But it's more like consciousness keeps getting nourished by sensations of the body (like Ros Crisp used to say about filling up??)

> Our objective experience consists of thoughts and images, which we call the mind; sensations, which we call the body; and sense perceptions, which we call the world. In fact we do not experience a mind, a body or a world as such. We experience thinking, sensing and perceiving. [@spira-2008-transparency]
- just so useful as a reminder or as a kind of 'ground zero' for how to consider what is going on in the improvisation practice

> Disorders of basic self-awareness have recently come to be explored in detail by means of an
extensive, phenomenologically based interview (Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience, EASE [36]). [@fuchs-2009-embodiment]

- From Hetty in November 2024: what is influence of being solo vs with other people?


Zrinka wondered about the materiality of experience: density, weight; and what other access could there be? -- e.g. smell, colour)

> Comparison of the two pieces vividly demonstrates how animacy and embodiment pull in opposite directions: where the former is a movement of opening, the latter is bent on closure. For the living, animate beings we are, argues dance philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, the term ‘embodiment’ is simply not experientially apposite. We do not, she insists, experience ourselves and one another as ‘packaged’ but as moving and moved, in ongoing response – that is in correspondence – with the things around us (Sheets-Johnstone 1998: 359; Ingold 2011b: 10). [@ingold-2013-making] 

> Perception and action are so tightly coupled that they determine and define each other. Every action alters perception by changing the incoming sensory data, and every perception is the way it is in order to help guide action. There is simply no point to perception in the absence of action. We perceive the world around us in order to act effectively within it, to achieve our goals and – in the long run – to promote our prospects of survival. We don’t perceive the world as it is, we perceive it as it is useful for us to do so. [@seth-2021-being]


> fully satisfying science: Another way of putting this ambition comes from the philosophers Susan Hurley and Alva Noë, who distinguish between ‘comparative’ explanatory gaps, which have to do with explaining why different experiences have the specific phenomenological properties that they do, and the ‘absolute’ explanatory gap, which is the (hard) problem of why and how there is such a thing as phenomenology at all. We can think of the real problem as exhaustively addressing comparative explanatory gaps in order to resolve, and perhaps dissolve, the absolute explanatory gap. See Hurley & Noë (2003). [@seth-2021-being]

> From the point of view of ignorance, the ‘person’ is what we are and ‘meditation’ is something that we do from time to time. From the point of view of understanding, ‘meditation’ is what we are and the ‘person’ is something that we do from time to time. [@spira-2008-transparency]

-- and this back to frontness as a way to conceptualise the role of improvisation and 'the self'

> In spontaneous, virtuoso interaction, one simply interacts, with no bifurcation of the world into subject/object or agent/action/object. “No trace of realization remains, and this no-trace continues endlessly.” This is not a positive awareness of selflessness, or a focus on nondual awareness; it is simply the absence of any reification of self, or dualistic consciousness, and an attitude that can become a permanent expert mode of being. [@garfield-2022-losing] (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves) ^f6f3d0

> However, theoretical and neuroscientific investigations attempt to dispel confusion about the experience of nonduality by drawing distinctions between the spontaneous realization of nondual awareness in its pure form, and other experiences of nonduality that still contain mental content and are realized through reflection (Josipovic, [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR26); [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR27); [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)). [@lynch-2021-role p.1641]

> Basic experiences of embodied selfhood are even more challenging to describe [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0010). There is a very low-level aspect of embodied self-experience perhaps best described as the experience of being a living organism, as opposed to owning a particular body, which seems to resist easy analysis in terms of the sort of perceptual inference responsible for exteroceptive perceptual scenes. This inchoate (and transparent, see [62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0310)) phenomenology of being a body describes a background experience of selfhood that shades into mood and emotion at one end and into experiences of body ownership at the other. This deeply rooted aspect of experienced embodiment involves no strong component of objecthood. Crudely put, we do not experience being a body in terms of the spatial arrangement of our internal organs as objects. [@seth-2018-being]


> Comparison of the two pieces vividly demonstrates how animacy and embodiment pull in opposite directions: where the former is a movement of opening, the latter is bent on closure.

We do not, she insists, experience ourselves and one another as ‘packaged’ but as moving and moved, in ongoing response – that is in correspondence – with the things around us (Sheets-Johnstone 1998: 359; Ingold 2011b: 10).[@ingold-2013-making]

> Based on what we know about private human minds and on what we know and can observe of human behavior, it is possible to establish a three-way link among: (1) certain external manifestations, e.g., wakefulness, background emotions, attention, specific behaviors; (2) the corresponding internal manifestations of the human being having those behaviors as reported by that human being; and (3) the internal manifestations that we, as observers, can verify in ourselves when we are in circumstances equivalent to those of the observed individual. This three-way linkage authorizes us to make reasonable inferences about human private states based on external behavior. [@damasio-2000-feeling] 

> Although this sounds complicated, we are all intimately familiar with the role of precision weighting in perception. Increasing the estimated precision of sensory signals is nothing other than ‘paying attention’. When you pay attention to something – for example, really trying to see whether a gorilla is out there in the distance – your brain is increasing the precision weighting on the corresponding sensory signals, which is equivalent to increasing their estimated reliability, or turning up their ‘gain’. Thinking about attention this way can explain why sometimes we don’t see things, even if they are in plain view, and even if we are looking right at them. [@seth-2021-being]

> Your past experiences include not only what happened in the world around you but also what happened inside your body. Was your heart beating quickly? Were you breathing heavily? Your brain asks itself in every moment, figuratively speaking, The last time I encountered a similar situation, when my body was in a similar state, what did I do next? The answer need not be a perfect match for your situation, just something close enough to give your brain an appropriate plan of action that helps you survive and even thrive.

> At a methodological level, the neurophenomenological strategy is to make rigorous and extensive use of first-person data about subjective experience as a heuristic to describe and quantify the large-scale neurodynamics of consciousness (Lutz 2002). The paper focuses on neurophenomenology in relation to three challenging methodological issues about incorporating first-person data into cognitive neuroscience: (i) first-person reports can be biased or inaccurate; (ii) the process of generating first-person reports about an experience can modify that experience; and (iii) there is an ‘explanatory gap’ in our understanding of how to relate first-person, phenomenological data to third-person, biobehavioural data.

## possible literature

### Giulia Lorenzi, Felipe Morales Carbonell: Modalizing in musical performance. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mila.12515, https://doi.org/10.1111/mila.12515.

The paper argues that when musicians perform, they constantly track “what’s possible” right now—what sounds they could make next, what moves would fit musically, and what they can physically do. Drawing on examples from jazz improvisation and classical performance, it sketches a framework for how performers learn and update these possibilities, and concludes there isn’t one single source of this know-how: perception, practice, conventions, and embodied skill all contribute. 

This is on the fringe of what I'm doing.

> The great teachers and adept contemplatives tell us that in deep states of meditation the ego self dissolves and merges into the expansive eternal soul or Atman Self which is the sacred territory of Witness consciousness. Witness consciousness is the ultimate goal, conscious witnessing is how we practice our way to that goal. [@marcow-speiser-2007-authentic p.72]
