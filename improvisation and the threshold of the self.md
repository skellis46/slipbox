# The Threshold of the Self: Dancing and Non-dual Awareness

keywords: dancing, improvisation, non-dual awareness, consciousness

## Abstract (working)

This chapter examines experiences of losing one’s sense of self during the dance and somatic improvisation practice known as authentic movement, focusing on the tangible threshold between _moving_ and _being moved_. It draws on practice-led research undertaken in 2024 by dancer Katye Coe, cognitive scientist L. S. Merritt Millman, research assistant and dancer Michaela Gerussi and artist-researcher Simon Ellis. The writing builds on a mixed dataset of intensive authentic movement sessions, video and photographic documentation, post-improvisation conversations, self-report questionnaires and desk-based research.

At its centre is a phenomenological analysis of the threshold as being a moment in which the mover’s sense of agency and identity undergoes radical transformation. I propose that this threshold marks a shift from the illusion of subject–object dualism toward non-dual awareness, where the feeling or illusion of a discrete self disappears. These experiences seem to share affinities with Csíkszentmihályi’s flow yet the analysis suggests that they are qualitatively different in kind, inviting reconsideration of how consciousness and embodiment interrelate in dance improvisation.

The discussion situates these findings within wider discourse on flow, presence and non-dual awareness, and considers how somatic training acts as an attentional bias, inclining dance and somatic practitioners to overemphasise the body's role in accessing such direct experience. While the research has implications for improvisation as performance, its primary contribution lies in resisting the lure of corporeal reductionism while articulating the possibilities of corporeality as a conduit for non-dual experience – how the body, through movement, reveals ways of being that momentarily dissolve the boundaries of selfhood. 


## Introduction: locating the threshold

This chapter is a description and an analysis of what I understand to be a vital and tangible yet delicate part of dancing: the threshold between knowing _one_ is dancing and ceasing to be aware that there is a _one_. In dance the experience of the two sides of that threshold is described as the difference between 'moving and being moved' [@adler-2002-offeringa p.30] or dancing and being danced.

The alarm sounds.

I am brought back to the world. My eyes were closed but I was not asleep. The feeling is akin to being woken up, and there is a brief moment of confusion or even shock before I re-register my surroundings: the room, the light, another person in the space, the silence, gravity; returning to a body I never left. 

When we wake, we wake _from somewhere_. 

This being brought back to the world is not an uncommon or unpredictable experience. When I am practising a form of dancing called [[authentic movement]] it recurs often enough to be treated as an event. Being woken up or disturbed from such an experience reveals that something is happening to awareness that feels complete and even permanent, while paradoxically being easy to disrupt and difficult to describe. 

Where was I before the alarm sounded? Who was I before the alarm sounded? Was _I_ before the alarm sounded?  

---

The threshold I am writing of is an event, not a state. It is a rupture or a portal, not an outcome. It can only be recognised retrospectively, when the dancer returns to _dancing_ after having _been danced_. On the _dancing_ side of the threshold are the familiar subject–object configurations through which human experience is ordinarily organised: I have a body, I am dancing in space, I am doing these actions, etc. On the _being danced_ side is nonduality, where those same configurations make no sense and where phenomenological description reaches its limit, not because nothing is happening but because the structures that make experience intelligible as subject and object have fallen away.

While the practice of dancing is phenomenologically complex, in this chapter I focus on the experiential qualities of the threshold and ask what happens to agency, self and knowing at the moment when movement ceases to be organised by a subject. Dancing is both the object of the research, and a vehicle for exploring what happens to research itself when its central object unsettles the conditions of observation, description and selfhood. When the research extend beyond dance its stakes become how epistemology, methods, ethics and disciplinary boundaries are configured and reconfigured in phenomenological practice research. 

This writing stems from experiences during a two-month long research project called _Losing Oneself_ supported by Coventry University's Centre for Dance Research, and held in the early months of 2024. The research team was Katye Coe (dancer), L. S. Merritt Millman (neuroscientist), Michael Gerussi (dancer-researcher) and Simon Ellis (dance researcher). 

The dancing underpinning these ideas is known as [[authentic movement]] and in _Losing Oneself_ it was practiced intensively by experienced dance professionals Katye Coe and me. The authentic movement practice involves two people: a mover and viewer (or witness) in which the mover improvises movement with eyes closed while the witness pays attention by observing. Both the mover and witness attempt to avoid making judgments on what happens. 

In this chapter authentic movement does not act as a proxy for all dancing (whether artistic or social), but I assume that it forks into many body-based practices (including various dance techniques), and is forked from many practices. Like other somatic practices designed as modes of internal bodily attunement, an important aspect of authentic movement is that what the movement looks like is not important, and what it looks like reveals little of the complex internal experiences of both the dancer and the watcher [@ellis-2020-corporeal]. The unimportance of how the dancing appears separates this practice from the conventional oculocentric ways in which artistic dance is codified, validated and imagined.

I also use the word _dancing_ rather than improvising to describe the activity of the mover, noting the distinction made by the American dancer and improviser Lisa Nelson:

> A lot of what people call improvising, I call 'dancing.' I wouldn't put it in the category of improvising. When I think about improvising, it's already another stage or another phase of a dancing urge, and it has to do with making something.

– Lisa Nelson [in @despain-2014-landscape p.39]

In this work with Katye, as each of us was dancing, we were not making something; we were dancing and being danced, and as we did this we passed backwards and forwards across the threshold of the self.  

## The threshold and its conceptual neighbours

[Situate the threshold without collapsing it into existing categories.]

I start by tracing the conceptual neighbours of the threshold through three lenses: dance and somatic practices, flow and non-dual awareness.  

### Dance and somatic practices: moving and being moved

The dancers interviewed by Kent De Spain for _Landscape of the Now_ [-@despain-2014-landscape] seem to describe experiences on either side of the threshold. De Spain himself alludes to the phenomenon of _being danced_ in how when dancing he moves between acting, responding and 'being acted upon' [@despain-2014-landscape p.72]. He describes how the experience is both frightening and liberating, because both emotions reveal that he is not the source of all his actions. 

> Spend enough time in the hyper-awareness of improvisation and you will undoubtedly begin to question such things as the nature of thought, or the source of desire, or even the structure of self.

– Kent De Spain [-@despain-2014-landscape p.52]

Reduced desire, or the absence of desire, is a recurrent theme in improvised dancing. Kirstie Simson has long used a practice explicitly called 'hands that don't want anything' [@ellis-2009-hands], while Steve Paxton describes both sides of the threshold as being when 'little sprits' like imagery and desire stop as if 'the mind has just been surgically removed' [Paxton, in @despain-2014-landscape p.77]. In Paxton's description there are hints of how Sheets-Johnstone references Kristeva's _primordial semiotic of gesture_ that affords 'no distinction between signifier and signified, and in which a bodily doing sets forth relations without specifying objects within these relations'  [@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga p.403]. 

Paxton is unusual in attempting to articulate both sides of the threshold or what I am describing as the difference between dancing and being danced. But he also implicitly suggests how any description of _being danced_ requires a self (subject) to be describing the experience (the object), and that this can only happen _after_ the return from being danced to dancing when there is self-awareness or reflexivity.

Then there are those artists whose descriptions of the complexities of improvised dancing reveal deep corporeal attunement only on _this_ side -- the _I am dancing_ side -- of the threshold. For instance, Barbara Dilley asks 'And what is that self-conscious state when one is simply highly aware and the self is part of that awareness?' [in @despain-2014-landscape p.63]. Similarly, Ruth Zaporah describes how she finds herself _doing things_, and that 'there's also this kid that's excited about it inside of me' who isn't judging the dancing [@despain-2014-landscape p.71]. 

What the threshold distinguishes from adjacent accounts of presence or absorption is not intensity but a critical junction across which selfhood is porous: on one side, experience retains a reflexive subject; on the other, the distinction between subject and object no longer holds. The implication is that both sides of the bardo are deeply embodied and highly attuned experiences, yet they are, as I argue in this chapter, different in kind. 

I use the Tibetan Buddhist word _bardo_ as it describes 'a transitional period between two states of existence' [@buswell-2014-princeton p.114] when habitual identities loosen, including at the moment of death. The spiritual dimension of thresholds underpins many body and dance-based practices. Authentic movement itself was developed as a dyadic practice by Janet Adler and is primarily used as a somewhat mystical form of movement therapy. Adler writes how 'the moving body invites an awakening – summoning the human soul toward a return, a reunion with the eternal' [@adler-2015-mandorla p.218] and that in the dancing there is the risk of 'experiencing the ineffable fear of a death of oneself as one has known oneself to be' [@adler-2015-mandorla p.222]. 

Healing and therapy through movement are vital concerns to many somatic practitioners [@eddy-2009-brief] and their practices are often tied to experiencing one's true self. In her phenomenology of dance writing _Consciousness Matters_ Sondra Fraleigh writes that through somatic bodywork 'I have also experienced the surfacing of this healing landscape, that aspect of my core self that I have come to trust as mythic and creative' [-@fraleigh-2000-consciousness p.58]. 

While such accounts frame somatic practice as a route toward healing and the recovery of a core or mythic self, other writers situate these same practices less in terms of self-discovery than in relation to contemplative or meditative presence. Marcow-Speiser and Franklin [-@marcow-speiser-2007-authentic] acknowledge the contemplative aspects of authentic movement that overlap with 'traditional meditative practices' [-@marcow-speiser-2007-authentic p.70] and the 'radical gesture of "just being" in the present moment' [-@marcow-speiser-2007-authentic p.70]. They say directly that authentic movement is a meditative practice in which the present moment is not simply a point in time but a mode of awareness. 

In _Thinking in Movement_ [-@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga] Sheets-Johnstone refers to an ongoing present: 

> My thinking in movement is thus not an assemblage of discrete gestures happening one after the next, but an enfolding of all movement into a perpetually moving present [@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga p.405]. 

Such accounts of presence are and have been a core component of describing experiences of dancing: being in the moment, dwelling in experience, embodied awareness, somatic attunement, etc. Together they seem to overlap with what is theorised in psychology as _flow_ [@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow] – a state of absorbed, present-centred engagement.

Worth discussing Katye's SIBAM (gestalt) stuff -- as 'dancing' side -- still deeply tuned. 

### Flow

Athletes have long given accounts of being in _the zone_[^zone] in which playing becomes effortless, one's sense of time is altered and unnecessary thoughts cease. In 1990 the Hungarian-American psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi published the first edition of his seminal work _Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience_ [-@csikszentmihalyi-1990-flow] which summarised decades of research into the positive aspects of human experience. Csíkszentmihályi describes how the phenomenology of flow[^nine] includes effortless and intense concentration, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time and when action and awareness merge and attention is fully absorbed in the present moment in the activity [@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow]. 

[^zone]: In Arthur Ashe's autobiography he describes being beaten by Bjorn Borg who was 'in what we call the zone'. _The zone_ was a reference to the TV series _The Twilight Zone_ and meant 'another world' [@ashe-1975-arthur].

[^nine]: Scientists have long measured flow experiences using a scale with nine dimensions. These nine dimensions are widely cited but are not necessarily stable experiential categories [@peifer-2022-scoping].



> So loss of self-consciousness does not involve a loss of self, and certainly not a loss of consciousness, but rather, only a loss of consciousness of the self. What slips below the threshold of awareness is the concept of self, the information we use to represent to ourselves who we are. And being able to forget temporarily who we are seems to be very enjoyable. When not preoccupied with our selves, we actually have a chance to expand the concept of who we are. Loss of self-consciousness can lead to self-transcendence, to a feeling that the boundaries of our being have been pushed forward.
 -- Mihály Csíkszentmihályi [-@csikszentmihalyi-1990-flow p.64]

'flow attempts to fortify the self' [@csikszentmihalyi-1990-flow p.105]
'The self becomes complex as a result of experiencing flow' [@csikszentmihalyi-1990-flow p.42]
The self is also 'is also one of the contents of consciousness' [@csikszentmihalyi-1990-flow p.34]

- [[the dextrous butcher]] -- also book Losing Oneself by Garfield
- [[Lynch & Troy - The Role of Nonduality in the Relationship Between Flow States and Well-Being]] - finish this sub-section with this (to shift in non-dual awareness)

- I think mention Montero's work here -- and get into the weeds. that are her claims re pre-reflective different from nda? 

> We hence see that it is not the presence of explicit thought that distinguishes ego-involved experience from ego-less experience. Instead, this distinction reflects the degree of immersion in activity and so the degree to which explicit awareness of oneself as standing outside that activity is diminished. It is a distinction that is more phenomenological than psychological, having to do with how we experience our own engagement with the world. When we are completely immersed in activity—whether the physical activity of carving an ox or the cognitive activity of thinking about how best to carve that ox—our sense of self, and with it, the experience of the duality of subject and object in experience, vanish. There is only the experience of a flow of activity. [@garfield-2022-losing Chapter 6, n.pag.]

### Non-dual awareness

NDA positioned explicitly as:
	+ a lens that names loss of subject–object structure
	+ not an explanation, not a telos (it neither explains the practice nor gives it a direction. It names something that can appear without being caused and without being aimed for. As soon as it is treated as either, it collapses into seeking, optimisation, or narrative closure.)

samadhi

> The term nonduality encompasses a unified experience in which the boundaries between self and environment dissolve. This experience of nonduality seems to underlie the experience of flow. [@lynch-2021-role]

> [E]xpert consciousness is nondual. The expert is not conscious of his or her own subjectivity and its relation to the object with which he or she is engaged, or even of the tools the expert might be using, including his or her own body. That is the kind of novice awareness that just gets in the way. Instead, the focused attention of the expert is entirely on the task at hand and on the goals to be accomplished through that task. It is immersed, embodied awareness, and awareness that is entirely fluid, adjusting to the ever-changing demands of the task at hand. Nothing resembling a self is ever present in this kind of consciousness. [@garfield-2022-losing]

  -- very very strong

in Western mindfulness it is called open awareness [@taft-2022-meditation n.pag.]; and in the Dzogchen Tibetan Buddhist tradition it is _rigpa_ or pristine awareness -- where awareness recognises itself without interference [@wangyalrinpoche-1998-tibetan]. 

josipovic-2024-reflexivity.pdf is very useful description of non-representational consciousness -- and how this work overlaps with that research. See [[Josipovic - Reflexivity gradients]] summary. More also (but likely not necessary) in josipovic-2021-implicit.pdf

Although these phenomena and ideas are not precisely the same, what they have in common is the way in which they explicitly or implicitly transgress or interrupt conventional understandings and experiences of a self. The term nonduality or nondual awareness ... -- and then add focus on [[nonduality]]

_Waking Up_ is a software application developed by neuroscientist, philosopher and podcaster Sam Harris (who himself is influenced by the Dzogchen tradition) and it contains a large number of meditations, conversations, lectures and practices exploring secular mindfulness. In a brief audio recording called _What is Mindfulness?_ Harris describes the illusion of self and nondual awareness in which the subject-object dichotomy collapses: 

- [[consciousness-as-such]]


> [...] that when you're truly paying attention to anything what is clear in those moments is that there's no one doing it. Everything is simply happening. Everything is arising on its own – thoughts, intentions, emotions – and vanishing. And this prior condition of consciousness in which all that is happening doesn't itself feel like I. It doesn't feel like a self. And so in that context one speaks and thinks less about mindfulness as a kind of behavior or practice or even state of mind and one tends to speak more about the nature of consciousness itself. [@harris-nodate-whata]

> Our results lend further evidence to the claims that NDA meditations are different from both FA and OM meditations. While FA and OM meditations are traditionally regarded as “constructed” states created through deployment of speciﬁc attentional strategies, NDA meditations are thought not to involve intentional effort, but to be based on identifying a reﬂexive awareness that is regarded as “unconstructed” (Mipam and Hopkins, 2006). Additionally, both FA and OM meditations are content-oriented, concerned with the speciﬁcs of experience, while NDA meditations could be seen as primarily context-oriented, concerned with the context of experience. (Zoran Josipovic, Influence of Meditation on Anti-Correlated Networks in the Brain)


it's even more than 'being danced' -- it ceases to be dancing. it's non-dancing. it's the movement that remains when there is non dancing. moving while non-dancing. 

"Underneath the layered expressions of selfhood involving memories of the past and plans for the future, before the explicit sense of personal identity, beneath the ‘I’ and even prior to the emergence of a first-person perspective and experiences of body ownership, there are deeper layers of selfhood still to be found. These bedrock layers are intimately tied to the interior of the body, rather than to the body as an object in the world, and they range from emotions and moods – what psychologists call ‘affective’ experiences – to a basal, formless, and ever-present sense of simply ‘being’ an embodied, living organism." (Seth, Anil, Seth-2021-Being)

"According to Josipovic ([2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)), nondual awareness is an underlying awareness in all conscious experiences, even if left unrealized. It could be that flow states tap into or uncover portions of this nondual awareness, revealing nondual features of experience to the individual." (Julianna M. Lynch & Allison S. Troy, The Role of Nonduality in the Relationship Between Flow States and Well-Being)

While these accounts of presence, attunement and being moved may appear to align with psychological models of absorption, the threshold I am describing is not simply a matter of intensified engagement but a qualitative shift in the structure of agency itself.

## 3. Methodological stance: phenomenology under pressure

Justify how you can study something that resists capture.

And this is the heart of the methodological problem in this writing. There are three phenomena: _dancing_, the threshold and _being danced_ and it is only the experience of _dancing_ in two conditions that is able to be described phenomenologically: i) the dancing that was happening before or leading up to the threshold, and ii) and the dancing that was happening after returning back from _being danced_. This is because while _being danced_ there is no object to observe, and no subject to do that observing. _Being danced_ -- and the threshold itself -- resist direct capture as objects of phenomenological inquiry.

### 3.1 Phenomenology as attuned to transition, ambiguity and pre-reflective experience.

- check that the pre-reflective in sub-heading makes sense here. Get those terms sorted out.

[[Herbert - The Body in the Mind#^9fb6b4]] 
- this on neurophenomenology [[a standing now and an ongoing flow]]

Seth on importance of subjective experience (first person)

In [[Barbour - Beyond Somatophobia]] she suggests three methods for investigating "lived dance experience": interviewing, creative journaling and dance making [@barbour-2005-somatophobia p.41]. Using phenomenology (along with others) but all gloss over the limits of addressing nonduality through method that is predicated on duality. But this is only a problem if I make a strong enough case for the presence of nonduality; otherwise the limits of phenomenology are irrelevant. 

Need to understand what phenomenology means by 'lived experience'. See Lumo prompt (Proton LLM)

"And this is a good thing for at least two reasons. First, immersed phenomenology is less likely to lead us into the error of positing the self. This is because the subject-object duality that thematizes the self as the subject of experience or the agent of action is itself a misleading structural superimposition on experience, a superimposition absent in immersed experience. Second, immersed phenomenology is indicative of expertise, and facilitates more fluid, successful performance." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

look at the questions these were asked: 
"Practitioners were asked the following questions:" (Mehling, Wolf E. et al, Body Awareness: a phenomenological inquiry into the common ground of mind-body therapies)

perhaps [[Dunne - Mindful meta-awareness]] is useful here -- meta-awareness as being this quiet 'monitoring'.

### 3.2 The problem:

NDA critiques that claim phenomenology fails at precisely this point.

- but how might nonduality (awareness / consciousness) be the object of research through practice? (it's illogical). 

	+ phenomenology -- see [[Krägeloh - Phenomenological Research Fails to Capture the Experience of Nondual Awareness]]


- [[Fraleigh - Consciousness Matters]]
Phenomenology's "mission is to find the irreducibles of subjectivity" [@fraleigh-2000-consciousness p.56]


On this point re Krägeloh and the limits of phenomenology:

> However, the thought about Consciousness or Reality is unique amongst all thoughts. When we try to think of Consciousness, it is like looking into a black hole. It is not even black. The mind simply cannot go there. It cannot go to that objectless place because the mind is itself an object. How could an object fit into a space that has no dimensions? [@spira-2008-transparency] - this is a huge limit

Is the following useful (both re above) and also [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]:
> However, the essence of the experience, a moment of Consciousness knowing itself knowingly, is colourless and transparent, and therefore cannot be remembered. [@spira-2008-transparency] 

For the purposes of this writing I consider awareness and consciousness as the same thing (e.g. Antonio Damasio – Self Comes to Mind (2010) and David Chalmers – The Conscious Mind (1996)

### 3.3 My  stance:


- Description as trace or after-image.
- Retrospective access as a feature, not a flaw.

[[body being known]] (or body being driven?)

Not crossing into something but rather leaving something make believe or usefully constructed -- not entering a state. 

"Consciousness is in the looking, not in the looked for" [@spira-2008-transparency n.pag.]. In the dancing, when I become a passenger, the _I_ dissolves into the looking and there is no looked for.  

"Likewise we do not experience the body in the way we normally conceive it. In fact there is no body as such. There is a series of sensations and perceptions appearing in Consciousness. And from time to time there is a thought or an image of a ‘body, ’ which is considered to be the sum total of all these sensations and perceptions." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

> All experience takes place here. This here is not a physical space. It is the space of Consciousness in which all experiences, including the apparent experience of space, takes place. A distant sound takes place here. The thought that subsequently conceives that sound to be at a distance from the perceiving Consciousness takes place in the same space as the sound itself. It takes place here. The chair on ‘the other side of the room’ is perceived here, in exactly the same place as the sound and the thought, at no distance from Consciousness. All bodily sensations take place in the same placeless place, which is here.[@spira-2008-transparency]

- the above from Spira is clear. These are merely appearances in consciousness. What then is consciousness? (see non-negotiable above). Love that phrase "the placeless place". Also this:

> One perception cannot appear within another. All perceptions appear within Consciousness. We do not experience a sensation inside the body. What we call the body is in fact the experience of a sensation. [@spira-2008-transparency]

- The above is just beautiful -- and head spinning. There are only perceptions appearing in consciousness. That is all. Have as a separate note called [[all perceptions appear within consciousness]]

### 3.4 Position practice research:

Practice as condition-setting and disclosure, not data generation in a narrow sense. that is:
	
First, it sets conditions. Through repetition, constraint, attentional orientation, witness–mover relations and temporal framing, the practice shapes a field in which particular kinds of experience become more likely. It biases perception, agency and self-relation without determining outcomes. Nothing is forced and nothing is guaranteed.

Second, it enables disclosure. What matters is what shows up under those conditions, often unpredictably, and often only retrospectively recognisable. These disclosures are experiential, relational and situational. They are not “generated” in the sense of being produced on demand, nor do they pre-exist as stable objects waiting to be collected.

So the claim rejects a narrow research logic in which practice is valuable only insofar as it yields codifiable data. Instead, practice functions more like an experimental ecology: it creates the possibility for thresholds, shifts or recognitions to occur, which can then be articulated, reflected on or analysed after the fact.

In short: the practice does not make data. It makes conditions under which something can be seen.

## 4. Encountering the threshold: conditions, markers and interruptions
- analytic core
- Analyse the threshold directly, with methods embedded.
- Structure this section around the threshold itself, not around methods.
- Methods appear here instrumentally:
- Conversations appear as sites of retrospective recognition.
- Questionnaires appear as points of mismatch or failure.
- Documentation appears as an active agent.

 The writing builds on a mixed dataset of authentic movement sessions, video and photographic documentation, post-practice conversations, self-report questionnaires and desk-based research.
[[non-ordinary states of consciousness]]

- [[losing oneself - summary of transcripts]]

### 4.1 Conditions
- Training, familiarity, commitment.
- Why these enable without guaranteeing.
- Briefly introduce authentic movement only insofar as it matters here.

One is being aware that there is an experience happening (which in itself is a deep immersed experience) to the other in which you become the experience. It's so subtle yet utterly obvious. 

Is there a 'bardo' in this work. "intermediate state between conditions"
gradual changes but then absolute. dawn/dusk not right -- like the sun is setting and setting then once it's gone complete darkness. Or a gradient like that suggested by [[Josipovic - Implicit–explicit gradient of nondual awareness]]

### 4.2 Markers
- Shifts in agency language.
- Temporal disruption.
- Reduced narrativity.
- Use conversation excerpts selectively.

> After this timeless interval, Consciousness takes the shape of the next appearance and may identify itself with a part of this appearance, a body. In doing so it ‘forgets’ itself and thereby appears to veil itself from itself.[@spira-2008-transparency]

I'm not sure I understand this idea of consciousness forgetting itself. I get how it takes the shape of the next appearance (say, a tingling in my hand). But what is the itself it is veiling itself from? That I identify the tingling as 'consciousness' as a 'thing'?? 

### 4.3 Interruptions and re-selfing
- Alarm, noise, pain, cameras, witnesses.
- Why interruption reveals the threshold rather than negating it.

## 5. Framing and bias: what the threshold does to theory
Show what the threshold forces us to rethink.

### 5.1 What NDA clarifies and what it distorts
- Why NDA helps name lucidity without self:
Non-dual awareness offers a language for this without forcing the experience back into a subject–object framework. It does not treat the loss of self as impairment, nor does it elevate it as a special state to be achieved. Instead, it frames these moments as a reconfiguration of awareness in which experience continues, often intensifies, while the sense of an internal observer drops away. This makes it possible to describe the threshold as a shift in the structure of awareness rather than a change in content, affect or performance quality.

Crucially, this framing avoids both mystification and reduction. It neither romanticises the experience as transcendence nor explains it away as attentional narrowing or dissociation. It simply names what the practice appears to disclose: that lucidity does not depend on a self being present to guarantee it, and that awareness can be clear, responsive and precise without being organised around an “I”.

- Why it risks spiritual teleology and hierarchy:
The problem is not spirituality per se, but the way explanatory language can quietly reinstall progress, hierarchy, and value where the practice itself does not support them. It is ethically flat.

### 5.2 Training and somatics as bias
- Somatic expertise as attentional conditioning.
- Why dancers may over-privilege bodily routes to non-duality.
- Explicit resistance to dance exceptionalism.

"So through repetition and training in these skills of noticing, differentiating, and discerning, individuals engaged in mind-body practices that involve the body are immersed in a process that leads to embodiment and integration." (Mehling, Wolf E. et al, Body Awareness: a phenomenological inquiry into the common ground of mind-body therapies)

"And then there is the practice of choiceless awareness. Given that the field of awareness we have been cultivating through the various practices described above is fundamentally limitless by nature, we can expand our awareness still further, beyond even attending specifically to the stream of our own thoughts and emotions arising and passing away in each moment. We can, instead, allow the field of awareness to be essentially infinite, boundless, like space itself, or like the sky, noting that it can include any and all aspects of our experience, interior and exterior, sensory, perceptual, somatic, emotional, cognitive as primary objects of attention, and that we can rest in this vast, sky-like field of awareness without choosing among or specifically featuring any of these particular occurrences. Instead, we allow them all to come and go, appear and disappear, as they will, and be known in their fullness from moment to moment within the nowscape. This is the practice of what Krishnamurti called choiceless awareness, akin to the practice of shikan-taza, or “just sitting—nothing more” in Zen, and to Dzogchen in the Tibetan tradition" (Jon Kabat-Zinn, Kabat-Zinn-2018-Falling)

- noting that what is different is the emphasis (right word?) on bodily sensation - but perhaps this is just a training bias?

does Sheets-Johnstone reify the body? 

- [[the act of perceiving itself coming to awareness]]
- thick description of that experience ... backgrounding of self / direct experiences of bias towards the corporeal (and tension of that bias with the the extent to which we are fundamentally corporeal) - see [[confusing self-consciousness with consciousness]], [[subject-body and object-body]] -- note the 4 layer map at bottom of this: https://chatgpt.com/share/6968cf1e-c378-8003-9fb7-3a1c85adbe76

- movement as a bias. That we in dance are training this bias (indeed this is what training can be thought to be). See also [[everything is becoming otherwise]]. also on this point see Spira below: [[#^b57941]]

> Although this sounds complicated, we are all intimately familiar with the role of precision weighting in perception. Increasing the estimated precision of sensory signals is nothing other than ‘paying attention’. When you pay attention to something – for example, really trying to see whether a gorilla is out there in the distance – your brain is increasing the precision weighting on the corresponding sensory signals, which is equivalent to increasing their estimated reliability, or turning up their ‘gain’. Thinking about attention this way can explain why sometimes we don’t see things, even if they are in plain view, and even if we are looking right at them. [@seth-2021-being] 

> If we think that we know something objective about ourselves or the world, then whatever that something is that we think we know, will condition our subsequent enquiry into the nature of experience.[@spira-2008-transparency] ^b57941

This is essential also in relation to training biases

- From Hetty in November 2024: what is the role of movement? (this is a key question re [[Seth and Tsakiris - Being a Beast Machine]] and the 'bias' of movement for dancers )

In the guided meditation on Tuesday 13 February 2024  ([that I shared with KC](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/daily/DA2963B?source=content%20share&share_id=083C72ED&code=SC73A05B4)), Sam Harris touches on the sense that the 'position' of the thinker/meditator as possibly feeling 'above' the feeling of movement in the hands. He, of course, challenges this idea or sensation. 

It occurred to me that one of the differences between a sitting meditation and a dancing meditation (like the one KC and I are practicing) is that the presence and persistence of bodily movement constantly undermines or quietens the headiness of being lost in thought. That it is more difficult to imagine the head as a centre or location of thinking and consciousness when sensation and awareness is contagiously dispersed throughout the body in motion. 

ties in with those papers re DMN (recently downloaded) and self-processing etc.

also ties in with below:

> We all spend a lot of time thinking about ourselves but how we appear to others about who we are in our lives and in the world about whether we are the person we want to be or expected to be but notice that this is who you are in this moment. You are precisely this experience. This moment of hearing, this moment of seeing. See if you can drop all of your ideas about yourself and sink into this moment of practice. There is always just this whatever else seems to be happening. (5:21min)

> This practice is simply about being non distracted by the automaticity of thought. What's left when you're not distracted, is nothing but the vividness of conscious experience. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching ... the arising of an emotion. (8:55min)



"Consciousness bestows its identity exclusively on the body. It believes and feels, “I am the body.”" (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

### 5.3 Why the threshold matters
- For dance research:
	+ Precision without mystification.
- For phenomenology:
	+ Value of studying moments where method strains.
- For interdisciplinary work:
	+ Dance as a test site, not an illustration.



They are epistemic because it examines how knowledge is produced when the knowing subject is unstable or temporarily absent, and how experience that resists first-person report still matters as legitimate scholarship. They are methodological by challenging the capacity for phenomenology to accommodate experiences that strain subject–object description, and by asking whether practice research can analyse events rather than outcomes or skills. The stakes are disciplinary in testing the grounds for dancing to be positioned in relation to consciousness studies, and whether dance can be interrogative more than illustrative or somehow exceptional. Finally, the stakes are ethical because of the risk of turning threshold experiences into achievements or hierarchies and to avoid spiritual or somatic exceptionalism.  



- future work in microphenomenology and/or [[neurophenomenology]]; see for instance [[Petitmengin - Studying the experience of meditation through Micro-phenomenology]] and anything by [[Dunne - Mindful meta-awareness]] 
- perhaps [[gibson and roche - and then again I draw myself to the detail]] work might be useful

"People instinctively regard themselves as selves in a very specific sense: they take themselves to persist through time as numerically identical subjects and agents, distinct from their minds, bodies, experiences, and traits. They do so even though they acknowledge that these minds, bodies, experiences, and traits are constantly changing and that they are only contingently connected to their selves." (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves)

- the thing about being in motion is that the constantly changing part is foregrounded exquisitely

"A generation after Kierkegaard insisted that [“the moment is not properly an atom of time but an atom of eternity”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/04/18/kierkegaard-concept-of-anxiety-time/) and a century before Mary Oliver drew on Blake and Whitman to observe that [“all eternity is in the moment,”](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/10/mary-oliver-on-punctuation/) Jefferies reflects:" (Maria Popova, The Ecstasy of Eternity: Richard Jefferies on Time and Self-Transcendence)

On the matter of direct experience: 

> Direct experience precedes the separation of knower and known, observer and observed. At its core is sheer awareness, the feeling of being. It’s with us when we wake up every morning and go to sleep each night. It’s easy to overlook because it’s so close and familiar. We habitually attend to things instead of noticing awareness itself. We thereby miss a crucial precondition of knowing, for without awareness, nothing can show up and become an object of knowledge.[@frank-2024-blinda]

This is a description of being on the other side of the threshold. But the paradox is that it precedes the separation of subject and object. It is not a state. Duality is the state. 

- benevolent indifference vs non-judgement: 
> Sooner or later Consciousness comes to see the difference between its own openness, its own Presence, which welcomes all things into itself with benevolent indifference, and a mind which, by definition, sees differences and yet has imposed on itself a straitjacket of ‘nonjudging.’ Such ‘non-judging’ comes from fear and confusion. It is not the true, benevolent indifference of Presence.[@spira-2008-transparency]

Steve Paxton talks of the body taking over

Steve Paxton: I know what "best" is for me. Best is fleeting seconds when my body takes over, and I suddenly realize that my imagery and my desires, whatever they might be, these little sprits of "now some arms maybe" or "now a time to run to the other side of the stage," the little things that happen stop happening, and the body's just going and enjoying itself. You know, quite happily moving as though the mind has just been surgically removed or something. That "free at last" kind of feeling.[@despain-2014-landscape p.77]

takes dance improvisation to be performative, in which "the process of creating is not the means of realizing _a_ dance, it is _the_ dance itself" [@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga p.399].

This is amazing. Wow. Wooo!" I could be doing the most devastating, heart-wrenching situation, but there's also this kid that's excited about it inside of me. Not judging it, just inside of the ride and having a fabulous time. So, there's no intending on a good night.[@despain-2014-landscape p.71]

While there is substantial scholarship on improvisation as composition [@albright-2003-taken, @midgelow-2019-oxford], there is comparatively little work that explicitly distinguishes non-compositional improvised dancing from improvisation understood as composition. 

This lack is a legacy of the political drive within dance practice to legitimate improvisation as a form of composition as important as choreography. Perhaps Chrysa's work is important in foregrounding the labour, skill and intelligence of the dancer.  

In _Taken by Surprise_ [-@foster-2003-takena] Susan Foster assumes that improvisation is something performed: "After all, to improvise is to compose extemporaneously and composition is an arrangement into proper proportion or relation" [@foster-2003-takena p.7]. 

Curiously, Foster notes that improvisation "most closely resembles a grammatical category found in the verb forms of many languages [...] known as the middle voice" [-@foster-2003-takena p.7]. Such words are neither passive or active constructions and the subject is neither acting or is acted upon. Her example of the equivalent in English is "shit happens" (p.7).

- but the subject is implied by context. it happens to someone. is this right?
- compare with Goldstein's passive constructions. It would be "shit happening"

In _Taken by Surprise_ [-@foster-2003-takena] Susan Foster takes dance improvisation to be part of a culturally recognised field and deploys it at the level of its aesthetic and epistemic effects, not its internal thresholds or experiential mechanics. The writing seeks to validate (dance) improvisation as a challenge to hegemonic thinking. 

> But the experience is profound and undeniable—sometimes I am acting, sometimes I am responding, and sometimes I am being acted upon—and it reveals so much about how we interact with the world around us. It is both frightening (I am not the source of all of my actions) and incredibly liberating (I don't have to be the source of all of my actions). And in that space between freedom and control is a landscape of rich possibilities. If you turn your awareness to the source of your movements and desires, what do you find? And what is the difference between the kinds of things you choose to do and the kinds of things that are "chosen" for you? [@despain-2014-landscape p.72]

- Authentic movement, or improvisation that crosses the threshold from “doing” to “being moved”, can be understood as a temporary return to this **semiotic field** — where gesture precedes the self and meaning arises without intention or control. (this is Kristeva's idea, cited in Sheets-Johnstone above). But, like S-J, it is predicated on a self. I suspect S-J also falls into reifying the body. 

- Sheets-Johnstone (1981) _Thinking in Movement_ [@sheets-johnstone-1981-thinkinga]. Excellent analysis/description of thinking in movement vs thoughts of movement (and how they are distinct). Main idea is that movement itself is a form of thinking—a dynamic, pre-linguistic mode of cognition through which meaning and understanding are generated bodily rather than abstractly.

Inside outside. All consciousness. Eyes closed alerts us to inside more. See [[no boundary between inside and outside]] -- the value/potential of closing eyes, but it's not necessary. Prioritises physical sensation. 

> At identifiable thresholds, penetration of fear or of awe - of an utter vulnerability – becomes the source of a growing strength. The risk of experiencing the ineffable fear of a death of oneself as one has known oneself to be can become the gateway into a transformation, into new ways of knowing.[@adler-2015-mandorla p.222]

"in all that happens between the experience of duality and unity consciousness" [@adler-2015-mandorla p.226]

I wonder what the role of newness in this work is at all. Does it have a role? Reading Foster (2003): 

> The known also includes an individual body's predisposition to move in patterns of impulses established and made routine through training in a particular dance tradition as well as the body's predilection for making certain kinds of selections from a vocabulary or a sequence of movements. [@foster-2003-takena p.4]

> That moment of wavering while contemplating how, exactly, to execute an action already deeply known, belies the presence of improvised action [@foster-2003-takena p.4].

- Foster also discussed the middle voice of "shit happens" (nonactive / nonpassive voicing)

The mover tries to let things happen without concern for what it looks like or how to interpret things

make note that clearly authentic movement does not speak for all dance -- talking about a specific somatic attunement. but it forks into many practices (and is forked from many practices). How it looks is not important. Start Section 2 with this.

That this is an article about dance improvisation is somewhat arbitrary. It could be many other practices that afford insight into the threshold. It is merely the practice of my expertise. But this also provides an opportunity to consider/assess the peculiarities of dance improvisation in this context, and its limits. 



> That is why the transitions from the waking state to the dream state and from the dream state to deep sleep, and vice versa, are considered in some spiritual traditions to be such significant opportunities for awakening. [@spira-2008-transparency] 



or the tiny moment when the transition occurs

- the line between driving and being driven -- the various names for this phenomenon. Brief attempt at this in [[that which doesn't arise and pass away]] and see also [[undistracted non-meditation]] as more help to describe the experience or phenomenon. 



**metaxis** — being between or betwixt two states.

- Ecstasis: note here:
**Eugene Gendlin (1997). _A Process Model_.** — describes consciousness as _ecstatic_ in the sense of exceeding static subject–object models. (summarised in LLM)

**ECSTASIS / “standing outside oneself.”** The old Greek name for outsideness—religious, aesthetic, athletic—where agency feels displaced and enlarged. The word _ecstatic_ comes from the Greek **ekstasis (ἔκστασις)**, meaning “standing outside oneself” or “displacement.”

This writing focuses on the threshold experience and I refer to the phenomena either side of this threshold as _dancing_ and _being danced_. 

There The stakes of the writing are fourfold:

_Epistemic:_ How knowledge is produced 

_Methodological:_ Whether phenomenology can accommodate experiences that strain subject–object description, and whether practice research can analyse events rather than outcomes or skills.

_Disciplinary:_ How dance improvisation is positioned in relation to consciousness studies, whether dance is treated as illustrative, exceptional or interrogative.

_Ethical:_ The risk of turning threshold experiences into achievements, credentials or hierarchies, and the responsibility to avoid spiritual or somatic exceptionalism.

This chapter is not simply about a particular dance practice or [[non-ordinary states of consciousness]], but about what happens to research itself when its central object unsettles the conditions of observation, description and selfhood. 
broader questions about consciousness and embodiment.

Finish with a very clear description of what the threshold is and what lies on its other side. [[that which doesn't arise and pass away]] is useful here.


I am not being clear. These are traditions that in fact describe the other side of the threshold. One the one side is moving, on the other being moved. In flow or out of flow. With or without interference. 


From _I am dancing_ to simply _being danced_. This passive construction is used by mindfulness practitioner Joseph Goldstein as a deliberate linguistic device to undermine the sense of a separate observing self during meditation. (https://www.danharris.com/p/how-to-get-out-of-your-head-joseph AND https://wisdomexperience.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Emtpiness-Course-Lesson-8-Reading.pdf)

Joseph Goldstein sometimes uses **passive-voice meditation instructions** as a deliberate linguistic device to **undermine the sense of a separate observing self** (LLM). Two citations: 

- **what is consciousness?**
- - see below re 'the placeless place' from Spira and also that it is _here_. 








"This clear seeing is not an intellectual understanding, although it may be formulated provisionally in intellectual terms when required by the current situation. Rather, it is the direct, intimate and immediate knowing of ourselves resting in and as the formless expanse of Presence, and simultaneously dancing in the vibrancy and aliveness of every gesture and nuance of the body, mind and world." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)

"So objects – that is, thoughts, sensations and perceptions – are not the content of Consciousness. Consciousness alone is the content of Consciousness. Thoughts, sensations and perceptions are the names and forms that Consciousness takes in the process of manifestation." (Rupert Spira, The Transparency of Things Contemplating the Nature of Experience)


- the nature of activities not design to do anything? process-oriented? (that is, it’s not goal directed)
- or perhaps make this about all of the key attributes — the scaffolding in the practice (non-judgement, process oriented, body in motion …??) -- should I include this kind of overview/summary?


on what kind of awareness is it? (unconstructed):

> Our results lend further evidence to the claims that NDA meditations are different from both FA and OM meditations. While FA and OM meditations are traditionally regarded as “constructed” states created through deployment of speciﬁc attentional strategies, NDA meditations are thought not to involve intentional effort, but to be based on identifying a reﬂexive awareness that is regarded as “unconstructed” (Mipam and Hopkins, 2006). Additionally, both FA and OM meditations are content-oriented, concerned with the speciﬁcs of experience, while NDA meditations could be seen as primarily context-oriented, concerned with the context of experience. [@josipovic-2012-influence]

> When the world dissolves at the end of a perception, Consciousness recognises itself, and this recognition is called Beauty. The words Understanding, Happiness, Love and Beauty are all synonyms for Consciousness, for ‘I.’ They do not refer to objects. [@spira-2008-transparency]
- above is kind of why it matters -- is it? (or perhaps that's in therapeutic sense)

Wonder if [[bodily sensation and behaviour influence emotions]] is useful as a "future thinking" or 'why it matters' component.

I like the following description of the self by Sacasas. It's for another context, but useful as reminder of the fluidity of our identification with _a_ self? 

> Put that way it doesn’t seem like an especially profound point. Indeed, it seems rather obvious. The self is not exactly fixed. It undoubtedly evolves over time, it is multi-faceted, and, critically, it escapes our full comprehension. All of this said, it seems to me that our experience of the self can range across a spectrum from more free-floating to more anchored. In these examples, people act as anchors. And, to be more precise, what we are being anchored to is some segment of our own past.[@sacasas-2022-stuff]

> They argue that the accumulation function in the posterior insula might be correlated with the encoding of time intervals as suggested by Craig (2009a,b). Craig’s model proposes a close interaction between interoceptive processes and time perception, suggesting that our experience of time emerges from emotional and visceral states processed in the insular cortex. It can be interpreted as a series of global emotional moments that are indexed across a finite period of present time, from the past into the anticipated future. These series produce a cinemascopic “image” of the sentient self that is continuous across a moving window of present time. [@herbert-2012-body]

> Attention is Consciousness with an object. When the object vanishes, attention simply remains what it always is, Consciousness [@spira-2008-transparency]

- can I make an argument here about the body during improvisation as a special kind of object [[an object of special regard]]?? But it's more like consciousness keeps getting nourished by sensations of the body (like Ros Crisp used to say about filling up??)

> Our objective experience consists of thoughts and images, which we call the mind; sensations, which we call the body; and sense perceptions, which we call the world. In fact we do not experience a mind, a body or a world as such. We experience thinking, sensing and perceiving. [@spira-2008-transparency]

For the living, animate beings we are, argues dance philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, the term ‘embodiment’ is simply not experientially apposite. We do not, she insists, experience ourselves and one another as ‘packaged’ but as moving and moved, in ongoing response – that is in correspondence – with the things around us (Sheets-Johnstone 1998: 359; Ingold 2011b: 10). [@ingold-2013-making] 

> Perception and action are so tightly coupled that they determine and define each other. Every action alters perception by changing the incoming sensory data, and every perception is the way it is in order to help guide action. There is simply no point to perception in the absence of action. We perceive the world around us in order to act effectively within it, to achieve our goals and – in the long run – to promote our prospects of survival. We don’t perceive the world as it is, we perceive it as it is useful for us to do so. [@seth-2021-being]


> fully satisfying science: Another way of putting this ambition comes from the philosophers Susan Hurley and Alva Noë, who distinguish between ‘comparative’ explanatory gaps, which have to do with explaining why different experiences have the specific phenomenological properties that they do, and the ‘absolute’ explanatory gap, which is the (hard) problem of why and how there is such a thing as phenomenology at all. We can think of the real problem as exhaustively addressing comparative explanatory gaps in order to resolve, and perhaps dissolve, the absolute explanatory gap. See Hurley & Noë (2003).

-- and this back to frontness as a way to conceptualise the role of improvisation and 'the self'

> In spontaneous, virtuoso interaction, one simply interacts, with no bifurcation of the world into subject/object or agent/action/object. “No trace of realization remains, and this no-trace continues endlessly.” This is not a positive awareness of selflessness, or a focus on nondual awareness; it is simply the absence of any reification of self, or dualistic consciousness, and an attitude that can become a permanent expert mode of being. [@garfield-2022-losing] (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves) ^f6f3d0

> However, theoretical and neuroscientific investigations attempt to dispel confusion about the experience of nonduality by drawing distinctions between the spontaneous realization of nondual awareness in its pure form, and other experiences of nonduality that still contain mental content and are realized through reflection (Josipovic, [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR26); [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR27); [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)).

> Basic experiences of embodied selfhood are even more challenging to describe [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0010). There is a very low-level aspect of embodied self-experience perhaps best described as the experience of being a living organism, as opposed to owning a particular body, which seems to resist easy analysis in terms of the sort of perceptual inference responsible for exteroceptive perceptual scenes. This inchoate (and transparent, see [62](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0310)) phenomenology of being a body describes a background experience of selfhood that shades into mood and emotion at one end and into experiences of body ownership at the other. This deeply rooted aspect of experienced embodiment involves no strong component of objecthood. Crudely put, we do not experience being a body in terms of the spatial arrangement of our internal organs as objects. [@seth-2018-being]

> Based on what we know about private human minds and on what we know and can observe of human behavior, it is possible to establish a three-way link among: (1) certain external manifestations, e.g., wakefulness, background emotions, attention, specific behaviors; (2) the corresponding internal manifestations of the human being having those behaviors as reported by that human being; and (3) the internal manifestations that we, as observers, can verify in ourselves when we are in circumstances equivalent to those of the observed individual. This three-way linkage authorizes us to make reasonable inferences about human private states based on external behavior. [@damasio-2000-feeling]

Increasing the estimated precision of sensory signals is nothing other than ‘paying attention’.

The paper focuses on neurophenomenology in relation to three challenging methodological issues about incorporating first-person data into cognitive neuroscience: (i) first-person reports can be biased or inaccurate; (ii) the process of generating first-person reports about an experience can modify that experience; and (iii) there is an ‘explanatory gap’ in our understanding of how to relate first-person, phenomenological data to third-person, biobehavioural data.

while in cognitive science it is called transient hypofrontality [@dietrich-2003-functional]. In Taoism _wúwéi_ [@slingerland-2003-effortless] or _action without actor_, in Zen _mushin_ [@soho-2012-unfettered] or _no-mind_, and in sport it bears similarities to [[flow]] [@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow] or being in -- or going through -- _the zone_ [@ashe-1975-arthur]. There is trance, shamanism and ecstasis [@eliade-2004-shamanism; @lewis-2002-ecstatic], the Sufi wajd [@schimmel-1981-mystical], speaking in tongues (glossolalia) [@samarin-1972-tongues], furor poeticus (poetic frenzy) [@dodds-2020-greeks], the Flamenco concept of duende [@garcialorca-2023-finding], and Vodou possession or _being ridden_ [@metraux-1972-voodoo]. In Russian, the word is simply _perezhivanie_, which means experiencing. In the [Dzogchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzogchen) Tibetan Buddhist tradition it is _rigpa_ or pristine awareness -- where awareness recognises itself without interference [@wangyalrinpoche-1998-tibetan]. In Buddhism it is _śūnyatā_ or emptiness -- the open, non-conceptual field of awareness itself that is self-luminous and nondual. 


And anyone who has long improvised or practiced in any form -- drawing, music, coding, writing or dance would recognise this brief description of the departure from there to here. 

## the principles

- Taoism: wu wei -- Alan Watts "not forcing" ([Alan Watts - The Principle Of Not Forcing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzaUGhhnlQ8). 17 July 2018. [Archived](https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211222/ZzaUGhhnlQ8) from the original on 2021-12-22 – via www.youtube.com). He said  "The river is not pushed from behind, nor is it pulled from ahead. It falls with gravity." (Watts, Alan (March 1974). _Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown_. Pantheon Books).

- is nda in these practices different from flow? (what is gained by this difference -- is it really different). different by degree? or kind?

From Kronsted email: 

> I think Montero is a good place to start, and some of the literature on meshed architecture will probably work too. Similarly the discussions on "smooth coping" intermix will with the flow debates.

> I find it interesting that much of the literature on "flow" continually adds and subtracts different conditions to the phenomenon. So many different cognitive phenomenon just get lumped together under flow. I think there are many ways of being in the zone.

> The great teachers and adept contemplatives tell us that in deep states of meditation the ego self dissolves and merges into the expansive eternal soul or Atman Self which is the sacred territory of Witness consciousness. Witness consciousness is the ultimate goal, conscious witnessing is how we practice our way to that goal. [@marcow-speiser-2007-authentic p.72]

> This state of pure being is the actor’s equivalent of when great athletes are “in the zone,” or the trance that a jazz improviser enters when they’re really cooking. The name for it is a Russian word, _perezhivanie_, which means _experiencing_. <https://slate.com/culture/2025/10/daniel-day-lewis-anemone-movie-oscars-best-actor.html>

## possible literature

### Giulia Lorenzi, Felipe Morales Carbonell: Modalizing in musical performance. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mila.12515, https://doi.org/10.1111/mila.12515.

The paper argues that when musicians perform, they constantly track “what’s possible” right now—what sounds they could make next, what moves would fit musically, and what they can physically do. Drawing on examples from jazz improvisation and classical performance, it sketches a framework for how performers learn and update these possibilities, and concludes there isn’t one single source of this know-how: perception, practice, conventions, and embodied skill all contribute. 

This is on the fringe of what I'm doing.
