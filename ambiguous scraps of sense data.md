# ambiguous scraps of sense data

_previous note:_ [[perceptions and sensory signals]]

> ambiguous scraps of sense data: Sense data is not only ambiguous but also incomplete. Information about the world and the body is lost when it’s processed by your retina, cochlea, and other sensory organs and sent to the brain. Scientists still debate just how much is lost, but everyone agrees that neurons convey less sense data from the world and the body than is available to be perceived. See 7half.info/incomplete.

> Your brain assembles these bits into memories: The idea that your brain uses past experiences to give incoming sense data meaning is in some ways similar to immunologist and neuroscientist Gerald Edelman’s proposal that your ongoing conscious experience is the “remembered present.” See 7half.info/present.

> A lot of sense data about the world and the body is lost when it is transduced in the sensors (i.e., the retina, the cochlea, etc.) and makes its way to the brain. Scientific estimates might be disagree by a factor of 10 but everyone agrees that neurons convey less info from the world than is out there. For example, the retina throws away a considerable amount of visual information.[1][2] So how do we see what is in the world? The brain infers what is missing — it can reconstruct it, infer it, can guess it, based on what it takes in. Much of the brain is reconstructing/reassembling the visual information that was useful in the past to construct what you see. There is an advantage to this: it allows your brain to bring wisdom to your perceptions -- your brain brings more information to every decision than just what you are able to sense in the actual input – historical inputs that you have encountered before – a past that is tailored to a specific set of circumstances in your culture or your personal experience.

> In addition, when a brain infers the missing input, it does so in a way that is informed by the other senses (e.g., the visceral systems in your body are helping your brain figure out what is important and what is not (what is signal and what is noise).[3][4]
