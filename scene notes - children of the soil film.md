## 15 grass cutting
This body is inseparable from that one.
This body is gone
(So hot, so tired)

Opening scene is shovel with thought bubble taking most of space and me digging in narrow line. Perhaps in two narrow boxes. 

Shovel is saying: 

I know what I'm doing. My blade is sharp. I'm an agent of change. 
 I am old but my blade is sharp. I am ready to work.
I know what I am doing. 
I am iridescent. 
I am the pulse between him and them. I make it possible. I am more than a thing to be used. I am an earth diviner.
