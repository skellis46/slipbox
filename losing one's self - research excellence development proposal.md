# losing one's self - research excellence development proposal

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

## Description of activities to be undertaken

_Context, aims/objectives, details of partners, funder/scheme/deadline if applying for pump-priming, planned outputs/outcomes; 500 words max_

### Overview and aim

_Losing one's self_ explores the phenomenology of dance improvisation in dialogue with research into nonduality, flow, interoception and consciousness. It hypothesises that this phenomenology has properties that are distinct from other mindfulness and body awareness practices commonly under investigation in consciousness studies and cognitive science [e.g. @schmalzl-2014-movementbased; @perez-pena-2022-mindfulnessbased; @mehling-2020-if; @mehling-2011-body; @gibson-2019-mindfulness]. The research aims to use dance improvisation as a case study to deepen current understanding of the role of interoception in experiences of nonduality and consciousness in trans-disciplinary research. The research will provide essential pilot data that will inform the external AHRC bid.

_Objectives (including outputs and outcomes):_
- establish new collaboration with neuroscientist Merritt Millman (Kings College London)
- develop first-person phenomenological and practice-led methodologies combined with third-person data collection techniques that are sensitive to dance improvisation practices
- to use the research data and methods as pump priming for a larger study (£300k AHRC catalyst bid to be submitted by 19 October 2024) exploring features of dance improvisation that have the potential to distinguish it from other mindfulness and body awareness practices 
- output 1: journal article co-written with the Co-I detailing the trans-disciplinary research protocols and research findings. The article will also help develop the PI's track record in the area prior to the AHRC bid.
- output 2: video essay to broadly communicate the research design and findings.

### Background

Improvisation in Western contemporary dance is built on complex and often abstract ideas to do with attention, body awareness, presence and mindfulness. In dance improvisation references to freedom [@goldman-2010-want] and losing one's self are common [@fraleigh-2017-back p.249]. 

Authentic Movement is a specialised form of improvised dance where a mover is _witnessed_ by another person, and in which both participants practice non-judgement or unconditional positive regard [@rogers-1957-necessary]. In other forms of dance improvisation in which the dancer practices in an environment of openness and trust without judgement, there are few if any phenomenological differences between these other improvisation forms and Authentic Movement [@ellis-2023-drunk]. The shared phenomenology occurs when the dancer ceases being aware of being seen (including seeing and judging themselves) or rather when the division between a subject observing an object disappears. Such a falling away of self-consciousness is known as nonduality or nondual awareness. Nondual awareness correlates with flow states [@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow] but is distinct in how the self-concept is altered in nondual awareness [@lynch-2021-role]. 

Most dance research has focused on descriptions of improvisation experiences and little if any dance improvisation research has focused on self-consciousness or, more precisely, deep processes in which self-consciousness disappears and the interoceptive foundations of this _disappearance_ are empirically observed. _Losing One's Self_ draws on dance practice research and the large body of work in cognitive science, neuroscience and psychology which has examined nondual awareness in mindfulness practices, and seeks to understand how dance improvisation practices may or may not contribute to this body of research.

- to examine the limits of phenomenological inquiry as an empirical form of understanding of nondual awareness


Authentic Movement started as a therapeutic practice and does not require the participant to have training in dance. It is now also used by professional dancers as a creative tool [e.g. @allen-2015-moon] and a performance practice [e.g. @mcleod-2020-dance]. 

lots of research in mindfulness, and a bit in body awareness re NDA. improvisation -- physically complex, anchored in the body -- unique set of conditions. 

Much work has done on the experiences and what they feel like (e.g. doughty: <https://www.communitydance.org.uk/DB/animated-library/improvisation-what-do-i-do-and-why-do-i-do-it?ed=14047.> -- but who is the person doing this experiencing? Deep experiences more akin to flow (but distinct from it) [@lynch-2021-role]

Little if any r Akin to flow but proposal more close to NDA.

> [dance] improvisers make choices in the moment and place an emphasis on immediacy and emergence. These qualities are often located within embodied, inside perspectives that value the subjective and experiential.[@midgelow-2015-improvisation p.107]


> The roots of this work, apparent in all three realms of the discipline, are directly known in dance, healing practices and mysticism. (Adler 2002: XVIII) Adler, J.

being given permission -- without judgement, whereby self-consciousness disappears. There is no-one looking at the self, including the self doing the looking (on the shoulder) -- there is no self looking -- where is this from? -- see [[self-conscious in the pejorative sense]]

Neuroscientist Anil Seth favours the value of first-person experience and phenomenology in understanding consciousness. He writes: "Wherever there is experience, there is phenomenology; and wherever there is phenomenology, there is consciousness" [@seth-2021-being Loc. 199] But in addressing and understanding the nature of nonduality, the psychologist Chris Krägeloh expresses doubt that phenomenology-based research is relevant in capturing nonduality because phenomenology is dependent on a subject reflecting upon an object of experience and it also relies "on discourse that is temporally removed from the experience" [@krageloh-2019-phenomenological p.19] At the heart of this tension regarding the value of phenomenology is that when it comes to nondual awareness, human beings do not _have_ an experience, rather our sense of self is created by experiential flow. The challenge then in this research is to seek ways to communicate the heart of the creative practice while not reifying _an_ experience. 

Regarding your role, my thought is that there are differing perspectives on the value/role of phenomenological inquiry when it comes to nonduality. For example Krägeloh says that "[Phenomenological Research Fails to Capture the Experience of Nondual Awareness](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ayfpb3ip91rcdhvpengk0/krageloh-2019-phenomenological.pdf?rlkey=k8ld6x2cim4o6g58zz9715dzo&dl=0)” while Anil Seth writes "Wherever there is experience, there is phenomenology; and wherever there is phenomenology, there is consciousness”. Most empirical and quantitative work regarding consciousness and nonduality has focused on mindfulness practices (with some exceptions around what the science literature calls ‘body awareness’). My hunch is that the strong role of the internal sensations in the body as an anchor in “witnessed" dance improvisation might open up possibilities for quantitative measures of that ‘internal world’ (although as you know there are conflicting correlations with self-reporting in this respect). My proposal is for you to imagine some possible mechanisms for quantifying the experiences that might enrich (or be enriched by) the phenomenology (first person). I’m particularly interested in your deep understanding of interoception (and dance) and how you might bring that experience to bear on some things about improvisation (and authentic movement) that might be (might be!) particular or peculiar as compared with mindfulness, body awareness. If I were writing a null hypothesis I’d say that there is nothing peculiar about authentic movement practices and in this small scale and initial ‘prod’ into the area the goal would be to set up some possible strategies and methodological protocols for a longer study to work around such a hypothesis. Outputs for this pilot would be an article and I’d like to also build a similar ‘video essay’ exploring the area — but that’s because I like the form!

my hunch is that would be enough to start the inquiry, and to get a feel for developing the protocols for a larger project. But even if it were as few as 20 hours that might just be enough to develop the collaboration (during and after practice sessions) and see what clear questions start to emerge.
