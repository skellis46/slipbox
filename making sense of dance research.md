# Making sense of dance research

In the last weeks I've had the opportunity to see a few people who I haven't seen in a long time -- perhaps 20 to 25 years. At some point in our conversation they'd ask me what I do, and when I told them that I worked at the [Centre for Dance Research at Coventry University](http://c-dare.co.uk) the look on their faces approached curious befuddlement ... or perhaps befuddled curiosity. 

What is it about the pairing of these two innocuous and commonplace words -- _dance_ and _research_ -- that seems to cause such consternation, uncertainty or even mirth?

Remember that [one of these things is not like the other](https://youtu.be/rsRjQDrDnY8) game in Sesame Street? Let's play it now: 

- Science research  
- Pizza research  
- Dance research  
- Music research  

Actually, instead of how they are different from each other, what might these items in a list have in common? When we attach the word 'research' to anything it implies a desire to find out or understand something differently. If I say to a friend that I need to do some research before choosing a pizzeria tonight they'd understand that there's a decision to be made, and that without the _research_ we might not make the best decision. 

This kind of pizza research is not so different to what artists understand to be part of _research and development_. That is, if I were making an artistic work about, let's say upholstery, then I'd need to do some research to find out as much as possible about upholstery. I'm not intending to trivialise either pizzas or an art work about upholstery here. In both cases the research is akin to 'background information' to be more informed and there are no parameters for how the research might happen.

Now let's apply two different words to each of the items in the list above: _about_ and _through_. For example, research _about_ science versus research _through_ science; research _about_ dance versus research _through_ dance. 

The word _about_ tells us the object of the research, but not how that research might happen. For example, research _about_ music might be something relatively informal or trivial like a web search to find the latest release from a particular artist. But research _about_ music also might use formal historical methods (with the traditions or conventions that historians use) to understand a piece of music differently. In the same way, research _about_ dance might use anthropology, history, sociology, or science (etc) as methods to increase human understanding of dance. 

When we research _through_ something a method is already implied, but the object is not. Research through science uses the scientific method to explore a phenomenon. Research through dance uses the practices of dance in order to explore ideas, phenomena, etc. In both cases, what is able to be examined, what is understood, and how understanding is presented (or made accessible) is in no small part determined by the methods used. The massive cultural difference is that when we hear the word research, it pairs easily or conventionally with the word science. But conventions hide possibilities and ought not limit the ways in which humans seek understanding.
