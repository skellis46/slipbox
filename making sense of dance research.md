# making sense of dance research

In the last weeks I've had the opportunity to see a few people who I haven't seen in a long time -- perhaps 20 to 25 years. At some point in our conversation they'd ask me what I do, and when I told them that I worked at the [Centre for Dance Research at Coventry University](http://c-dare.co.uk) the look on their faces was more or less curious befuddlement ... or befuddled curiosity. 

What is it about the pairing of these two innocuous and commonplace words -- _dance_ and _research_ -- that seems to cause such consternation, mirth or uncertainty?

Remember that [one of these things is not like the other](https://youtu.be/rsRjQDrDnY8) game in Sesame Street? Let's play it now: 

- Science research  
- Pizza research  
- Dance research  
- Music research  
- Medical research

Perhaps more interestingly, what might they have in common? My thought is that when we attach the word 'research' to anything it implies a sense of the desire to find out or understand something differently. If I say to a friend that I need to do some pizza research before dinner tonight they'd understand that there's a decision to be made and that without the _research_ we might not make the best decision. 

Perhaps this kind of research above is not so different to what artists understand to be part of _research and development_. That is, if I were making an artistic work about, let's say upholstery, then I'd need to do some research to find out as much as possible about upholstery. By comparing this kind of research to pizza research I don't intend to trivialise either pizzas or an art work about upholstery. In both cases the research is more like 'background information' that might be useful; it's about being informed. 

The difference is the difference between the words _about_ and _through_. That is, I can do some research _about_ science or _through_ science. This difference is not trivial at all, and it gets complicated when it comes to trying to describe dance research to people.

How we do the 'about' research will vary enormously. Different histories, etc. 

Three different possibilities 
Includes using dance practice itself to understand its possibilities and limitations and excesses.

I've heard this described as _little r research_, although I suspect the categorisation of little versus big is not so helpful. 

Perhaps little r research is not so different from the kind of research that artists understand to be part of _research and development_. 

Curiously, this kind of little r research is possible to perform on the entire list: science, dance, music, pizza and medical. We do this when we look into some aspect of music, or medicine, etc.
