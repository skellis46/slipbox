# flow and nonduality

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

> Certain aspects of flow allude to features of nonduality, such as a merging of a person’s awareness with the action being performed, alteration of time, deep concentration, and intrinsic motivation to perform the activity for the sake of itself. Indeed, flow and nondual experience correlate with one another. Yet, nonduality captures a great distinction in how a person perceives themselves and their relations to the world. Rather than merely a loss of self-conscious worry or concern, our findings here suggest that a person’s self becomes integrated with the activity during a state of flow. The integration of subject and object may allow a person’s emotions to be acknowledged, expressed, and processed through the activity. As a perspective of nonduality emerges, an understanding of unity between self and other is encouraged which may aid in the therapeutic process (Blackstone, 2015). The “loss of self-consciousness” dimension of flow was not significantly correlated with the “self-transcendence” dimension of nondual experience, suggesting that experiencing nonduality captures a specific alteration in the self-concept that flow experience alone does not seem to account for.

- this thing about loss of self-consciousness reminds me of the idea that being self-conscious is more akin to becoming aware of being seen (by someone else) from the outside. I wrote of it in [[climbing mountains]] and first happened across it listening to Sam Harris' Waking Up app. See also [[what the self feels like]] in which the self is attached to thinking when we do not recognise we are thinking (and relationship to [[DMN]]?). ^2141a6
