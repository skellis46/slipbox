# printing press

Zuboff also writes of how "the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people"[-@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] and bypassed the priesthood of that age. She describes the internet as a democratizing power that mirror's Gutenberg's revolution exponentially. The cost however is the hidden processes of data extraction "designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure", that have created a new priesthood of privately owned companies in Silicon Valley. We have been returned to the "pre-Gutenberg order"[@zuboff-2019-age Chapter 6.IV The New Priesthood: n.pag.] by this technocratic priesthood which seeks competitive advantage through surveillance, fully weaponised by the printing press of our time. We have been both freed and enslaved.

> the printing press put the written word into the hands of ordinary people, rescuing the prayers, bypassing the priesthood, and delivering the opportunity for spiritual communion directly into the hands of the prayerful. We have come to take for granted that the internet enables an unparalleled diffusion of information, promising more knowledge for more people: a mighty democratizing force that exponentially realizes Gutenberg’s revolution in the lives of billions of individuals. But this grand achievement has blinded us to a different historical development, one that moves out of range and out of sight, designed to exclude, confuse, and obscure. In this hidden movement the competitive struggle over surveillance revenues reverts to the pre-Gutenberg order as the division of learning in society shades toward the pathological, captured by a narrow priesthood of privately employed computational specialists, their privately owned machines, and the economic interests for whose sake they learn.[@zuboff-2019-age n.pag.]

In 2015 the dance scholar Harmony Bench wrote an influential article called _Digital Research in Dance Studies: Emerging Trends in a Still-Emerging Field_. Bench wrote of the movement of dance practices, the endless scenarios in which dance occurs, and how video documentation is changing dance: 

>The impact of this unleashing of documentation could not be more profound. [...] Let me be clear: for those of us who produce or conduct research in the areas of dance, movement, and gesture, this is our "Gutenberg."[@bench-2015-digital n.pag.]

To compare unparalleled access to video documentation of dance with the printing press is seductive. But which kind of "Gutenberg" moment is Bench referring to? Ubiquity? Democratization? There is also potential darkness in Bench's comparison.

> Central to his ideas about culture was his concept of media as "extensions of man." Following this line of thought, he argued that Gutenberg's printing press not only played a role in spreading information, but also in shaping human thought. <https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2015/09/27/these-4-visionaries-saw-far-into-the-future-heres-how-they-did-it/>
