# kerr - borgmann on merton

_previous note:_ [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]]

---

Aaron Kerr is a philosopher who writes about theology and the ethics of technology. This article draws on the thinking of Albert Borgmann and Thomas Merton to consider the relationship between contemplation and technology. This relationship is vital as technology is now "more than a distraction, it is a constant fog."[@kerr-2016-borgmann p.72]

Kerr outlines Borgmann's concept of [[device paradigm and focal things]], but calls them simply "things" and "devices":

>For Borgmann, a “thing” -- “is inseparable from its context, namely its world.” A thing necessarily provides more than one commodity -- it involves “manifold engagement” -- the stove not only heats the house, it becomes central to activity; the cutting of wood, the tending of fire, the telling of stories.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.60]

>The machinery of a device, on the other hand, makes no demand on our skill, it comes from somewhere else, it has no context excepting its utilization in the disburdenment of our struggles with darkness, cold, and food. The purpose of the device is “relatively fixed” -- the device can come in different forms, but its end purpose is always consistent and unchangeable -- the television is an exemplary device in this regard. This device distances us from reality, it mediates our engagement with the way things are, and in the words of Borgmann, “degrades the natural symmetry between humanity and reality.”[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.61]

Kerr suggests that Borgmann provides a way for us to see the patterns -- "the human desire for comfort connecting to the sense and relief of disburdenment, the separation of machinery from commodity, the way commodities keep us from more social engagements, the pattern’s unquestionable ubiquity and logic"[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.72] -- of the technological fog in order to find our way to a focal practice. 

The article hinges on four concepts: devices, things, disburdenment and contemplation. Disburdenment refers to the ways in which technologies disburden humans of effort or labour. This is neither positive nor negative.

>A television becomes a device, a device becomes an object of disburdenment, some disburdenment is good, yet the pattern of disburdenment fragments. The moral complex of our culture of technology is picked apart, analyzed, critiqued -- we are open to the good technology can bring, we are openly aware of the problems it manifests.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.76]

Kerr understands that as much as technology interferes with the capacity for contemplation, we must find some kind of balance:

>For a more human future, one in which the breadth and openness of reason and spiritual longing might remain mutually enhancing and life-giving actions of learning, it is necessary to understand how technology and contemplation interact -- technological action and its effects, and contemplative space or time and its fruit.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 p.59]

_thoughts & links:_

- Kerr's use of terms _things_ and _devices_ galvanised my understanding of device paradigm and focal things. That the _paradigm_ aspect is the ways in which we see that device changes our conceptualisation of the device. It stands in for something else. And the word _focal_ really helps understand the ways in which a practice or object might draw people and ideas together (e.g. in the case of the hearth or fireplace)
- in Kerr's writing of the thing vs the device, I wonder where the body fits. I wonder if somatics might be both thing and technological device? (I doubt it - it's definitely a focal thing ;-)). Perhaps this depends on how _technology_ is defined. 
- it's almost as if Kerr is expressing a form of luddite-ism through philosophy. I don't mean this as a criticism
- am also reminded of the ways in which Amish people deeply consider whether or not to introduce new technologies. I first encountered this idea in Cal Newport's _Digital Minimalism _[-@newport_digital_2019]
