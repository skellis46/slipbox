Series 2: The body and science

"Overall, AI perpetuates the ‘view from nowhere’. The view from nowhere is the claim to a neutral and disinterested view of the world. Science itself is the ultimate expression of this viewpoint: the scientific observer is a ‘modest witness’ (Haraway, 1997) who allows nothing subjective to interfere with the construction and observation of the experiment and the recording of the results." (McQuillan, Dan, McQuillan-2022-Resisting)

- through humans and machines (mainly through STS) [[Ysabel Gerrard and Helen Thornham - Content Moderation Social Media’s Sexist Assemblages]]
- role of bodily sensations: see [[body awareness and emotion]] p.804 for brilliant summary
- notion of self and embodiment [[interoception as fundamental feature of embodiment]]
- overlapping and divergent methodologies, laboratory systems (Rhineberger), understandings, knowledge, metaphors, even belief systems. 
- "the spectre of embodied cognition" [[Alvin Goldman and Frederique de Vignemont - Is social cognition embodied]]
- [[emotion, affect and internal bodily awareness]] -- allostasis versus homeostasis (Feldman Barrett)
- controlled hallucination (Anil Seth) - predicting brain, agency
- something about the rational (see[[somatics unlimited]]??) body? 
- https://www.skellis.net/blog/ouspe-resist-being-contained
- https://www.skellis.net/blog/refuses-to-disappear
- the nature of abstractions (in science and dance) and [[explaining away (Whitehead)]]
- validation of somatic practices through science - Ginot [[somatic practices, interoception and evidence]]
- [[interoception science overview]]
- that which is observable and that which is not -- differing stances on empiricism
- what does science do to the body? how is the body changed by science? what metaphors are most useful which are distracting? what are the limits of scientific understanding of the body? (and why?)

What kind of body is it that we are now discussing? What is agreed? Where does it diverge? How safe is it? How much pain is it in? How is dance's concept of the body threatened or enhanced by scientific thinking? 

> Somehow, it seems, brain processes acquire a subjective aspect, which is invisible to science [@garfield-2022-losing n.pag.]

- [[the body is not a machine]]
- [[first-person experience]]
- methods for findings things out, e.g. in [[Peter Ellerton - How Do You Know That What You Know Is True That’s Epistemology]]
- Arendt on instruments for measurement: [[Comment Magazine - The Virtue of Noticing]]
- new dualism - [[brain versus body is the new dualism]]
- Jacobs and technological core (including science): [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
- Haraway: [[Haraway - Symbiogenesis, Sympoiesis, And Art Science Activisms]]
- thinking of Latour and matters of fact and matters of concern; see [[Stephen Muecke - The Generous Philosopher]]
- avoiding treating abstract model as if it were reality ([[Jon Haidt and Ravi Iyer from After Babel - Why Haidt and Schmidt’s Proposed Social Media Reforms Are Insufficient]]) -- see also romantic science in [[Alan Jacobs - A Humanism of the Abyss]]
- Guy Claxton and play (like Pickering): [[Guy Claxton, Bill Lucas, Tanya Byron, Octavius Black - Educating Ruby]]
- perception of change vs change in perception [[measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices]]
- [[interpretation remains present]] -- very useful
- Borgdorff on something being untouched [[the many practices of practice research#^e0141f]]
- experimental psychology [[the body in artistic research#^a634a0]]
- Le Guin quote about subjectifying versus objectifying in [[the body in artistic research]] -- this whole zettel is worth looking at in detail
- concept of 'the lived body' in [[the lived body and embodiment]] -- as distinct from a body under observation

> Importantly for dance pedagogy, these questions are asked not through cognitive science but through aesthetics, poetics, and language-making that emerge from a radically anti-Cartesian perspective. (from [[Wait - Improvised Dance]])
- worth noting that any serious scientist is also adopting an anti-cartesian perspective (not implied by Wait here)

In _The Mangle of Practice_ (1995) the sociologist and historian of science Andrew Pickering describes the practice of science as an unpredictable "dance of agency" (Pickering 1995: 21). Pickering's goal was to make a case that scientific practice represents a "dialectic of resistance and accommodation" (Pickering 1995: 22-23) and that it is overwhelmingly ad hoc.

> What does it tell us about ourselves?—can and should be answered in the key of neuroscience. We think that everything about us that matters is fixed by our brains and that by turning our focus inward we can discover our true nature. And so it seems right, when we face the task of making sense of art, to look to neuroscience. 
> I take a different approach. Not because there’s anything wrong with trying to understand art in relation to our biology; indeed, this is an exciting and important aspiration. But rather because neuroscience has yet to frame an adequate conception of our biology.[@noe-2015-strange Chapter 8 n.pag.]
