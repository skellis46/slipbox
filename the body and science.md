C-DaRE invites Series 2: The Body and Science

When scientists and dance artists and scholars talk about the human body, what kind of body are they describing or attempting to understand? There are disciplinary divergences yet the hard dualistic line between body and mind is dissolving and science's supposed view from nowhere as a "modest witness" [@haraway-2018-modest_witness] is widely debated particularly within the sciences. The historian of science Andrew Pickering has described the practice of science as an unpredictable "dance of agency" [@pickering-1995-mangle p.21], in which scientific practice represents a "dialectic of resistance and accommodation" [@pickering-1995-mangle pp.22-23] that is overwhelmingly ad hoc. The scientist Randolph Nesse argues that although the metaphor of the body as machine is seductive, it is more accurate to describe the body as "a soma shaped by selection" [@nesse-2016-body n.pag.]. 

Series 2 of C-DaRE invites explores _The Body and Science_, and in it we ask what kind of body is the human body now? We explore and debate notions of self and embodiment; the "spectre of embodied cognition" [@goldman-2009-social p.154]; pain; somatic practices rendered as measurable; medicalised time [@wasson-2021-waiting] and the Bayesian body and brain. We seek divergent understandings of what kind of body science is observing and/or creating and we ask what role other research fields and ways of knowing in the arts might have to play in this creation, and how the irrepressible movements, actions and practices of the human body are open to re-interpretation and re-imagination.

In 1994 I started full-time dance training at the Victorian College of the Arts in Melbourne. I was 25 years old. At the same time I was completing a Masters Degree in Kinesiology (mostly Newtonian mechanics) at the University of Otago School of Physical Education in Otago, Aotearoa New Zealand. At the VCA I was given credit for BA-level classes that were called Kinesiology. Yay. I didn't have to go to those classes. It didn't occur to anyone (including me) that there was practically zero cross-over between the Kinesiology I had been studying for 6 years and the Kinesiology that was being taught at the VCA. I tell this story not to establish any scientific credentials on my part. Far from it. Rather, I tell it as an example of the cultural schism between science and art. Ah, but that was nearly 30 years ago I hear you say ...

; observability, and experiential and quantitative abstractions 


"bones and muscles were just fancy systems of levers, ropes and pulleys"[@nesse-2016-body n.pag.]


> Embodiment theorists want to elevate the importance of the body in explaining cognitive activities. What is meant by ‘body’ here? It ought to mean: the whole physical body minus the brain. Letting the brain qualify as part of the body would trivialize the claim that the body is crucial to mental life, simply because the brain is the seat of most, if not all, mental events. [@goldman-2009-social p.154] 

: methods, histories, epistemic belief systems, and empiricism itself. Y

In dance scholarship we often remind ourselves and others of the aphorism that not everything that counts can be counted, and perhaps we imagine that we ought to have some claim over the nature of of embodiment. 

- the hard problem of consciousness: "Somehow, it seems, brain processes acquire a subjective aspect, which is invisible to science" [@garfield-2022-losing n.pag.]

"Overall, AI perpetuates the ‘view from nowhere’. The view from nowhere is the claim to a neutral and disinterested view of the world. Science itself is the ultimate expression of this viewpoint: the scientific observer is a ‘modest witness’ (Haraway, 1997) who allows nothing subjective to interfere with the construction and observation of the experiment and the recording of the results." (McQuillan, Dan, McQuillan-2022-Resisting)

> Importantly for dance pedagogy, these questions are asked not through cognitive science but through aesthetics, poetics, and language-making that emerge from a radically anti-Cartesian perspective. (from [[Wait - Improvised Dance]])
- worth noting that any serious scientist is also adopting an anti-cartesian perspective (not implied by Wait here)

> What does it tell us about ourselves?—can and should be answered in the key of neuroscience. We think that everything about us that matters is fixed by our brains and that by turning our focus inward we can discover our true nature. And so it seems right, when we face the task of making sense of art, to look to neuroscience. 
> I take a different approach. Not because there’s anything wrong with trying to understand art in relation to our biology; indeed, this is an exciting and important aspiration. But rather because neuroscience has yet to frame an adequate conception of our biology.[@noe-2015-strange Chapter 8 n.pag.]
