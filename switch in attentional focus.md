# switch in attentional focus

_previous note:_ [[body awareness and emotion]]

> Imagine that you are sitting down to meditate. You rest yourself comfortably on your meditation cushion and straighten your back. Your mind is still operating on the DMN as you relive a conversation from earlier in the day or worry about a project that is due at the end of the week. But then you engage the lPFC/Director and activate the TPN, silencing the DMN. [Williams, cited in @kirchner-2017-tpn n.pag]

- TPN is task positive network
- DMN is default mode network
