# Simon Roberts - The Power of Not Thinking How Our Bodies Learn and Why We Should Trust Them

_previous note:_ [[embodiment]]

> In slightly more technical terms, what is happening is that the instructions or propositions are being translated into what are known as “sensorimotor procedures” that can be performed effectively without thinking. While a driver continues to “think out loud” as they perform these procedures, this is a sign that they are still learning. It is “only when they don’t think about what they are doing in words,” remarks anthropologist Maurice Bloch, “that drivers are truly experts.” (loc 209)


> They can act without thinking or, more precisely, without thinking about thinking. Their actions become automatic. Their body, and not just their brain, has developed the knowledge of how to drive a car. (loc 215)


> The human skill of driving a car and the difficulty of building autonomous vehicles illustrates the central premise of this book: that our intelligence does not just arise from our brains. It is not merely the product of our brains “processing” abstract information or representations of the world, nor can it be programmed as a set of rules or propositions that enables us to think in particular ways or perform particular actions. Instead, our understanding of the world arises from our bodies’ interactions with and perceptions of the world—and it is through these interactions that our bodies acquire knowledge. (loc 223)

> We are able to handle the complexity of driving by using our brains and bodies together. Driving a car is a prime example of what I call “embodied knowledge”: a form of knowledge where we have acquired practical understanding and ability through perception or experience. When we have embodied knowledge we instinctively know how to act. As the term suggests, it is not knowledge that resides in our brains but one that comes to inhabit our bodies. (loc 233)


> the idea that we use the world around us as “scaffolding” for our thinking, has gained widespread acceptance.(loc 249)

> from the Silicon Valley developers swapping brainstorming for “bodystorming” (loc 251)

> Over the course of my career in consulting I have grown convinced that we should put experience at the heart of how policymakers, global businesses, and other organizations understand the world. I’m an anthropologist and work with many such organizations, and in recent years I’ve focused on applying the theory and practice of embodied knowledge to how my clients comprehend the world.(loc 257)

> Big business and policymakers have bet big on capabilities that are all about scale and objectivity, with the goal of producing a detached, rational view of the world. Yet at the same time, the application in business of the relatively esoteric field of anthropology has been booming. Anthropologists work at a very small scale, with sample sizes in the teens rather than the millions, and their principal tool is their own body and the experiences they share with the people they live among, rather than “data lakes,” servers, and computational thinking. (loc 267)

> This book is born of my conviction that it is impossible to know the world though data alone and, more positively, that our bodies are immensely powerful tools for understanding and making sense of data. It is directly informed by my experience of working with business—I have seen first-hand how executives struggle to make sense of reports and abstract data and how understanding drops into place when they engage directly in other people’s worlds. (loc 275)

> Foundational understanding of the world, derived from direct experience, can allow us to imbue the numbers with meaning and be confident in our judgments about what they are telling us.(loc 278)

> Given how powerful computers have become, and given our species’ superiority complex, it is unsurprising that we still compare our mind to these machines.(loc 297)

> A computer is a calculating machine that works on the symbolic representations of the world that it is fed, and it follows the rules of the programs that it is running. It is what the cognitive scientist Andy Clark called a “disembodied logical reasoning device.”(loc 300)

> In 1973, the American sociologist Daniel Bell popularized the term “post-industrial society” and predicted the rise of an “intellectual technology” that would, he said, sit alongside the emerging information and computing technologies. (loc 346)

> Society, he suggested, would be characterized by the use of data to describe the world, on which judgments would be based. Bell’s prediction now appears prescient. Computing has not just provided the firepower for processing the world around us; it has provided an intellectual framework that claims to be able to map, model, and understand the world. (loc 348)

> In order to highlight the differences between a big data-controlled school system and a janitor, we can follow philosopher Shaun Gallagher in comparing “brains in vats” with “flesh and blood creatures equipped with beating hearts.” Gallagher, author of the influential book How the Body Shapes the Mind, wanted to distinguish between two ways of thinking about a brain.(loc 360)

> To say his intelligence is embodied is to state the obvious: brains are part of our bodies. The human mind emerges from a brain that is located in a head that sits on the shoulders of a body that is in, and of, the world around it. The brain and body work together to enable us to make sense of the world: the sensors on our bodies help us smell, taste, feel, and hear the world around us.(loc 368)

> Embodied knowledge is what separates us from the artificial intelligence that increasingly defines how our lives are lived—it is our competitive advantage.(loc 417)

> The more actively we develop embodied knowledge, the better placed we will be to cope with uncertainty and make good decisions based on an empathetic understanding of the world. It is time to recognize that how we know, think, and feel emerges from the interactions between our minds, bodies, environments, and experiences.(loc 423)

> Reliable knowledge, Descartes suggested, is only available to us when we put our emotions to one side and apply our minds. In making this argument, he was laying the foundations for centuries of distrust of the body as a source of understanding.(loc 506)

> Taken together, these three ideas establish a very distinctive and enduring division between minds and bodies. Minds are  superior, the animating source of knowledge and truth, while bodies are transportation devices at best and sources of sensory deception at worst.(loc 512)


> This age of reason confirmed the mind as the means for achieving knowledge; in Descartes’s philosophy it didn’t just relegate the body but actively warned against it since, he argued, reason and certainty come from physical disengagement and dominion over our senses.(loc 526)


> As the science writer George Zarkadakis notes, we are living in “the century of the brain.”(loc 533)

> His fellow Frenchman and contemporary Blaise Pascal was a mathematician, physicist, inventor, and theologian, who had started building calculating machines as a teenager to help his father, a tax collector.(loc 543)

> A series of mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists worked on the development and improvement of such machines during the eighteenth century, but a breakthrough was achieved in 1822 when the English mathematician Charles Babbage developed his “difference engine.” This device was distinct from the machines that had preceded it because it could use the results of a previous calculation in the subsequent one: the next level of mechanized arithmetical complexity had been achieved.(loc 549)

> As the computing historian Doron Swade puts it, What Lovelace saw was that number could represent entities other than quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation.(loc 560)

> Lovelace is the namesake of an annual award for the achievements of women in science, technology, engineering, and math, and she was the original computer scientist. She sits at the top of a long line of inventors and thinkers whose work led to the aspiration to automate thought and reasoning. This line flows from mechanical ducks and mechanical daughters, via Babbage and Lovelace, to mainframe computers, big data, and artificial intelligence. All these innovations depend on the distinction between mind and body and the emergence of the idea that intelligence is the preserve either of the mind or “mind-like” entities.(loc 569)

> Both the shift from early mechanical calculating machines to the promise of machines that can “think” for themselves and the reproduction of human-level intelligence, known as artificial general intelligence, are founded on the idea that intelligence emerges from the mind, the operations of which represent a form of pure information processing. When viewed in those terms, the body in which the processor is located plays little or no role in this “higher” form of intelligence and is ignored as subsidiary. (loc 577)

> Our bodies are not just lifeless entities directed by the mind as early modern philosophers contended; they have a much more profound influence. They are at least equal partners in our intelligence and play a central role in our acquisition of knowledge. (loc 582)

> “The map appears to us more real than the land.” D.H. LAWRENCE (loc 588)

> It has been said that Humboldt was the last man to know everything.(loc 596)

> As the scholar of semantics Alfred Korzybski noted when he said “the map is not the territory,” the description of the thing is not the thing itself. Models of the worlds cannot purport to describe how it really is. (loc 665)

> we have replaced embodied engagement with the world around us with a form of disembodied efficiency that helps us cut though space quickly without seeming to engage with it. This sense of efficiency without an accompanying sense of experience, of knowledge without a sense of under-standing, is evident in another technology that, like GPS, represents an expression of the primacy of mind over body.(loc 673)

- Not sure i fully get the connection between experience and embodied understanding. Experience is not only corporeal

> Yet big data is now regarded as essential to business, while dictums like “data is the new oil” (coined in 2006 by Clive Humby, the British mathematician and data scientist who designed the Tesco Clubcard reward program) reveal the extent to which businesses feel like it is their primary raw material.(loc 728)

> The early social physicists and proponents of big data are direct descendants of the Cartesian view that the world could be represented through abstract scientific models that can render it numerically.(loc 742)

> Proponents of big data have invited us to believe that this map is the territory; indeed, sometimes, as D. H. Lawrence suggested, “the map appears to us more real than the land.” (loc 745)

> However, there are also plenty of occasions where our own experience of the world needs to be brought to bear on what the data is purporting to tell us. (loc 750)

- Reminded of [[knowledge that is localised and fleeting]] and [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]]

> As they sit in stillness and silence, math teacher and author Kester Brewin concludes, children become “straight-backed automatons.” (loc 766)

> What we are taught is drawn from a prescribed set of subjects which increasingly favor the so-called “STEM subjects,” science, technology, engineering, and math, at the expense of more creative disciplines that involve the body, be that sport or the arts. In tandem with a narrower focus on what is being taught, technology is increasingly applied to teaching and assessment. (loc 767)

> Yet Brewin suggests that “by over-emphasising ‘academic’ skills and assuming that they are best learned in stiff silence—or digitally sedating children and failing to pay heed to the vital role that movement plays in knowledge acquisition and assimilation—we risk failing a generation,” since much evidence shows that both practical and conceptual understanding arises through practical engagement with the world and physical artifacts. (loc 771)

> Modern education downplays experience and movement, despite the existence of a large body of research confirming the belief of Maria Montessori, the founder of an education movement, that movement helps learning. Montessori wrote in 1912 that “one of the greatest mistakes of our day is to think of movement by itself, as something apart from the higher functions ... Mental development must be connected with movement and be dependent on it ... Watching a child makes it obvious that the development of the mind comes about through his movements ... Mind and movement are parts of the same entity.” (loc 807)

> The implicit snobbery of academic over practical knowledge has long been a feature of Western education systems. As Stephen Cave of the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence points out, over many years the British education system assessed children at the age of eleven, with a view to deciding whether or not they were cut out for an intellectual career. As Cave sees it, this is a stark illustration of the way in which the education system explicitly rewards the mind at the expense of the body. (loc 814)

> They are technologies that embody efficiency and control but not experience, engagement, or real understanding. These technologies encourage us to avoid messy and uncontainable things, like emotions, relationships, feeling, atmosphere, and mood. Instead we’ve been asked to focus on numbers, patterns, outliers, and correlations, and detail and color get washed out. (loc 833)

> However, the best model of the world is not a map but the world itself, and our bodies are instrumental in how we acquire knowledge of it. (loc 846)

> Octopuses are gentle and inquisitive, and display considerable intelligence. They are known to respond to different humans in different ways, apparently able to distinguish between them. (loc 856)

> As the philosopher Amia Srinivasan puts it, the “megapixel screen of an octopus’ body … has expressive bandwidth.” (loc 864)

> Octopuses are fascinating creatures, which as philosopher and diver Peter Godfrey-Smith notes, urge us to rethink what we mean by consciousness and intelligence. (loc 833)

> Instead of seeing our relationship with the world as defined by our cognitive efforts, phenomenologists argued that it is our body which defines our fundamental relationship to the world. Merleau-Ponty suggested that “all forms of human experience and understanding are grounded in and shaped by our ... bodily orientation in the world.” For him, our perception of the world begins with the body rather than with the mind. Whereas rationalists like Descartes saw thought preceding perception, for Merleau-Ponty our perception of the world begins with the body. (loc 900)

> Merleau-Ponty was not content with the view that the mind allowed us to be detached observers of the world and instead felt that the body is our “anchorage” and what gives us our point of view of the world. Everything we know and understand about the world, he believed, comes from our body’s relationship to it. While Descartes’s famous dictum “I think, therefore I am” puts the mind first, had Merleau-Ponty put it so concisely, he might have said, “I have a body, therefore I can know.” The body was at the heart of his theory of perception and knowledge. (loc 908)

> You are having what you and the phenomenologists would call “an experience,” and your body is at the heart of it. Occasionally you might take a pause from dancing, and an inner voice might think “Woah!,” but on the whole this is a sensory rather than a cerebral experience. You don’t stop to break down and process all the individual inputs—the sounds, the smells and sights—but you experience (and later remember) them as a whole. You are experiencing what Merleau-Ponty would call a world as a whole, and your perception of it is very much a bodily one—it is hard to imagine feeling this way without being in it. (loc 920)

> it is the enduring concern of Merleau-Ponty’s life’s work. He saw it not as a state of mind but something that arises from our body’s relation to the world, which meant that for him, the body forms the basis of all human understanding. Bodily perception is what discloses or reveals the world; (loc 927)

> If we accept that everything we experience at that concert, and in our everyday lives, such as “thinking, judging, remembering, imagining, expecting ...[is] anchored in the body,” as Taylor Carmen puts it, we can come to realize that our bodies are at the heart of things. Perception then is a bodily phenomenon, in that we experience our own sensory states not merely as states of mind but as states of our bodies. (loc 932)

> Many accounts of how we do things imagine a list of procedures stored in the brain, which we retrieve as and when we need them. Merleau-Ponty called this “I know” knowledge, but he was more convinced by practical “I can” knowledge. (loc 947)

> It is interesting to reflect on the thrust in human life to put everything we can into language, as if that’s the key to unlocking understanding. Yet embodied knowledge is lived rather than documented and does not lend itself to easy articulation. (loc 962)

> Thinking, understood as the processing of abstract representations of the world around us, is clearly central to human life and achievements. For example, describing and understanding features of the world through such representations as mathematical symbols has enabled humans to measure the height of mountains, create steam engines, build stable bridges, and develop powerful communications technologies. Yet at the same time, because the mind-first view has predominated, we’ve sidelined understanding that arises from the body through experience. Until Merleau-Ponty, we ignored the fact that our minds are part of bodies that exist in and experience the world. (loc 985)

> Yet at the same time, because the mind-first view has predominated, (loc 988)

> Philosophy has tended to emphasize the thinking; practical, bodily action figures little in that idea, and yet our lives involve both thinking and doing. Embodied knowledge sits in the middle of this continuum—it’s a form of knowledge that allows us to act as if we are not thinking, because with knowledge imprinted on our bodies we can act without consciously reflecting upon what we know. We develop embodied knowledge without having to be taught it because we acquire it through the experiences our bodies encounter and the actions they perform. (loc 992)

> In his famous Playboy interview, the Canadian philosopher Marshall McLuhan, “the high priest of popcult and metaphysician of media,” explained how the emergence of literacy and the printed word led us to believe in the superiority of the “cool and neutral eye” over the other senses. He attributed fundamental changes in how we perceive space and time to this “rise of the eye.” “The man of the tribal world,” McLuhan suggested, “led a complex, kaleidoscopic life precisely because the ear, unlike the eye, cannot be focused and is synaesthetic, rather than analytical and rational.” Literacy, he said, gave man “an eye for an ear,” which led to a diminishment not just of hearing, but of touch, taste, and smell too. (loc 1011)

> That data was able to yield what the philosopher Thomas Nagel described as “the view from nowhere”: an objective and detached perspective. (loc 1049)

> In a 1935 essay on the body, the French sociologist Marcel Mauss claimed that “the body is man’s first and most natural instrument,” by which he meant that it is at the center of how we learn, perceive, and express our knowledge of the world. (loc 1088)

> Man is usually the hunter, but what would it feel like to be hunted across open moorland like a stag? What’s it like to spend the night sleeping among foxes in an alleyway in London’s East End? Charles Foster’s fascination with the lives of animals has led him to do some unusual things in pursuit of answers to questions like these. (loc 1109)

> Although there might be some natural limits to our bodies—Thwaites encountered the limits of human joints in trying to become a mountain goat and Foster longed to become a swift—the biggest limitation is our insistence on using the mind to acquire knowledge rather than the body. That acquisition of knowledge through observation rather than instruction is something that can be witnessed in a variety of settings, and there’s an intriguing body of science to explain how this happens. (loc 1184)

> The story of the minaret craftsmen demonstrates a world that is different from what we might expect from the building of a complex, tall and intricate structure. Practical knowledge is emphasized at the expenses of theoretical understanding, yet is not taught so much as enabled through a process of observation without instruction, and the asking of questions by students is discouraged. In such a setting how might it be, Marchand puzzled, that apprentices can learn the subtle and elaborate arts of minaret masonry? (loc 1222)

> Shared utterances highlight the idea that speech is a collective rather than an individual act. Speech interactions create a shared understanding and demonstrate that knowledge is not some static object that can be passed like between people but rather that it gets created through interactions. (loc 1240)

> Motor simulation theory emerged at the turn of the century from the field inhabited by cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and psychologists. Although these disciplines are focused on understanding the brain and the mind, over recent decades many within these fields have come to understand that how we think, what we know, and sensorimotor experience are intimately connected. Sensorimotor refers to the combination of both sensory and motor functions and is often contrasted with cognitive capacities. However, researchers have shown how certain action-related cognitive states relate to the performance of the action; more precisely, they have shown that imagining an action without executing it activates the same neural pathways. Simply put, thinking of performing an action shows up in the brain as if the action had actually been performed. (loc 1257)

> Conversely, as David Jones demonstrated in an article for Physics Today in the 1970s, and in a neat illustration of the nature of bodily skill, it’s also possible to ride bikes that are theoretically unrideable. Through trial and error, most us can master the art of riding a bike. (loc 1318)

> ... bike riding neatly illustrates that we can possess knowledge that eludes articulation. Most of us know how to ride a bike, but we can’t begin to put into words how you do it. The scientist Michael Polanyi, who was fascinated by this relationship between explicit knowledge and the knowledge we find hard to articulate, which he termed “implicit,” noted that “we can know more than we can tell.” Knowledge that has become embodied, like the ability to ride a bike, is hard to put into words. (loc 1336)

> Humans learn quite differently from computers, Dreyfus argued; while computers learn by gathering pieces of information and rearranging them in ways that follow predictable rules, humans acquire knowledge through our interactions with our surroundings and repeatedly performing actions. (loc 1394)

> He believed that we use our bodies to make sense of the situations we are in and that our bodies learn through acting. Bodies are responsive to the result of their actions: they absorb feedback and begin to know what to do as a result. Dreyfus built a theory about how skills are acquired, in which the diminishing role of instruction or conscious thought is a central idea. It has found wide acceptance in many fields and has influenced disciplines as varied as AI, robotics, social work and nursing. (loc 1397)

> Someone who is proficient can see the problem that needs to be solved but still needs to figure out what the answer is. They don’t break down the situation into its individual elements, as beginners do, but confront or engage with it as a whole—this boat, on this stretch of water, in these wind conditions, traveling in this direction relative to the tide. With proficiency, an understanding based on experience that occurs without conscious effort starts to emerge. The skill they have acquired is the ability to conduct pattern recognition on a range of different factors. (loc 1424)

> As we move through these various levels of skill and attain expertise, something else happens: we think less about what we are doing and start to feel not that we are “doing something” but rather that we are “in” what we are doing. We are not sailing a boat—we are sailing. (loc 1433)

> Only when people are not really thinking about what they are doing, suggests Dreyfus, can we truly call them experts. (loc 1437)

> When our bodies just know what to do, we can say we have acquired expertise. (loc 1443)

> There’s abundant evidence from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to demonstrate that overthinking leads to a decline in performance. Standing at the top of a particularly frightening black run, I experience what the science shows—“reflecting consciously on what one knows about a skill often undermines its proper performance.” In cases like this, there’s a negative relationship between conscious reflection and skilled action. (loc 1456)

> This is helpful initially but as we become good at things it is no longer necessary—indeed, the evidence suggests that what is known as “verbal overshadowing” actually becomes counterproductive. (loc 1465)

> At the outset of learning something, we need to focus on what we are doing and break it down into discrete steps, but as we become better at something we are able to perform the task “as a whole.” (loc 1472)

> The golfers were given twenty attempts to putt the ball from locations at different distances from a hole, and each of them tried the skill-focused and dual-task conditions. The results were clear: the experienced golfers performed significantly better when listening for the tone than when they were focusing on when their swing was finished. The experiment showed that skilled golfers could accurately putt balls when performing another task, but when they were asked to focus on what they are doing, their putting became less accurate. (loc 1481)

> There’s plenty of research to support these findings but some people claim that the idea of experts who can perform their skills without thinking is neither helpful nor accurate. As the ballet-dancer-turned-philosopher Barbara Montero notes, “Ballet is not effortless: those ethereal nymphs in Les Sylphides who seem to simply levitate are actually jumping their wings off.” (loc 1496)

> As the ballet-dancer-turned-philosopher ... (loc 1497)
- (assume this is Montero)

> While their work shows that paying attention to each step during a performance might help the novice but hinder the proficient, this doesn’t extend to the other types of attention that skilled performers display—their concentration must take other forms if they are to be truly successful. For example, a sportsman might focus on evaluating a move or stroke they’ve just made, pay particular attention to what her opponent is doing, or make sure they stay focused. (loc 1504)

> In other words, cultural knowledge, like much of the practical knowledge we’ve been exploring, is fuzzy at the best of times. (loc 1536)

> As Dreyfus puts it, “cultural style is so embodied and pervasive that it is generally invisible to us ... cultural style is too embodied to be captured in a theory and passed on by talking heads. It is simply passed on silently from body to body.” These are skills that are not taught so much as acquired through practice and through exposure to them.” (loc 1542)

> “Improvisation embodies the power to create value freely from an instantaneous encounter.” DAISUKU IKEDA (loc 1552)

> When we are driving there are many variables in play, which makes building computer systems that can deal with complex real-world environments like roads, with a huge range of diverse signals and stimuli, much harder. (loc 1657)

- Losing one's self: conditions for improv change little (that is, these conditions in which we are improvising are not very open at all. The openness comes from thoughts, memory, imagination)

> Dillard understood that empathy for the lives of others comes not from reading about their lives or even talking to them, but by attempting to experience their worlds through the body. (loc 1833)

> Scholars typically talk about two types of empathy—cognitive and affective—and the distinction is significant. Cognitive empathy is the ability to take another person’s perspective, seeing the world from their viewpoint or understanding “where they are coming from.” However, when you have affective empathy you display an ability to recognize and share others’ emotional responses to a situation or environment. (loc 1849)

> Despite the growth of the web, cheap connectivity, and a proliferation of ways to connect with each other, distance is still one of the biggest barriers to understanding and empathizing with other people’s lives. That distance is both spatial and social; however cheap and easy communications might be, they don’t physically bring us into contact with other people, and scholars like Sherry Turkle, the author of Alone Together, have suggested that they might make us feel more connected while at the same time separating us from others. (loc 1865)

> The concept of empathy as we know it today emerged from the world of psychology and many explanations of what it is are psychological in orientation, but there’s also a strong case for suggesting that the body is at the heart of how we can experience, and so understand, the lives of others. (loc 1879)

> In her book How the Body Knows Its Mind, cognitive scientist Sian Beilock discusses research that has shown that when James said “refuse to express a passion, and it will die,” he was right. (loc 1913)

> What we see and perceive of the world is from our body’s point of view, and the body gives us what Shusterman calls the “primordial point”—our bearing in the world. (loc 2135)

> The body, as Mauss saw it, was not just a neutral bundle of flesh and bone but a repository of cultural knowledge, as well as something that expresses that knowledge. Acquiring the status of a professional requires not only learning a craft or trade but the development of a certain body or bodily disposition. (loc 2179)

> The ex-marine Mark A. Burchell, an anthropologist who completed the thirty-two-week Royal Marine training process—and has participated in it again as a researcher—remarks on how it is designed to essentially break down a young man’s body and remake it as a soldier’s. The process of making elite soldiers is physical for a reason, and not simply because of the physicality of soldiering; the body is central to their identity as a marine. As Burchell puts it “their repetitive bodily engagement with the military’s material culture such as assault courses and other physical training environments, will transform their mind and physical postures from one of being tested to one of triumph,” and this continues throughout the training program “enabling their gradual progress toward embodiment of their new identities as Royal Marine Commandos. At this point the body is weaponised and ready to deploy.’ (loc 2183)

> The French thinker Gaston Bachelard talked about “muscular consciousness,” which is a nice way of summarizing how the body is involved not just in how we experience but also how we remember. That phrase puts a heavy emphasis on the idea of movement and awareness, giving a physical expression to the nature of memory and leaving you in no doubt that he regarded memory as more than a cognitive phenomenon. (loc 2271)

> Over many centuries, the Western world has tended to obscure the potential of our bodies for making sense of the world and their role in what makes us intelligent; at worst, it has dismissed the body as a source of misleading or merely subjective information. The push for a disembodied approach to make sense of the world has marginalized the body by relying on abstract representations. Yet because of this, what comes with the body, not least feeling and emotion, has also been lost; instead we’ve opted for dry and factual representations of the world, which provide a partial account of how it is and how it feels. (loc 2309)

> Indeed, as the organizational theorist Ikujiro Nonaka observed in Harvard Business Review, it is “deeply ingrained in the traditions of Western management to view the organization as a machine for ‘information processing.’” It’s a particular type of knowledge that such organizations are designed and predisposed to regard as useful—that which is “formal and systematic—hard (read: quantifiable) data, codified procedures, universal principles.” (loc 2366)

> Alison contends that to have an impact in large organizations, “People need to understand the data and they need to have the visceral experience.” The data without the experience makes little sense, and the experience without the data has little clout within an organization. (loc 2506)

> Second, as Ikujiro Nonaka observed when describing the modern Western business as akin to a life-sized Excel spreadsheet, the key to successful business is not in “processing” objective information. Rather, it depends on tapping the tacit and often highly subjective insights, intuitions, and hunches of individual employees and making those insights available for testing and use by the company as a whole.” (loc 2559)

> Embodied knowledge acquired through experience is not theorized and abstracted but is grounded in the observations we’ve made, consciously or otherwise, and in what our body has perceived and put into action through practice. (loc 2562)

> These responses to the experience also point to how hard it is to express this other sort of knowledge. (loc 2577)

> As Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead’s treatise Principia Mathematica showed, any concept can be expressed logically in zeros and ones if it can made unambiguous. (loc 2592)

> Understanding both people and markets depends not just on data but in developing a feeling and an informed intuition that is based not on abstraction but experience. (loc 2596)

> A 2014 report by the business consultancy PwC titled “Guts and Gigabytes” appeared to lament the fact that despite advances in data science, analytics executives are making decisions based on instinct. Meanwhile, 2016 research from the same team reports that when asked what people will use to make their next strategic decision, 33 percent of executives say “experience and intuition,” though it appears that this is something the authors wish to see eradicated. (loc 2598)

> The Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman has written extensively on the idea of intuition in life and business and makes the point that the problem with intuition is that it feels the same whether we are wrong or right. In his writing about decision makers in business, he is critical of executives who let their past successes lull them into a sense of unjustified self-confidence in environments where they are expected to be decisive and act quickly. Yet in a world of imperfect information, ambiguity and uncertainty, judgment will always be required. Consensus and committees can lead to indecision and half-hearted decisions, which can be just as harmful as hasty conclusions. The question then becomes how to make sure people’s intuitions are based on relevant experience. (loc 2603)

> When Drucker defined knowledge in the context of business, he wasn’t referring specifically to embodied knowledge but he could have been: “Knowledge is information that changes something or somebody—either by becoming grounds for action, or by making an individual (or an institution) capable of different or more effective action.” (loc 2613)

> As the photographer and critic Susan Sontag put it, “[I]n a world saturated, no, hyper-saturated with images, those that should matter have a diminishing effect: we become callous. In the end, such images just make us a little less able to feel, to have our conscience pricked.” (loc 2634)

> The sociologist William Davies makes the point that the claims of experts to be able to access a dispassionate perspective that is unavailable to the “man on the street” is what makes their opinions seem so distant from other people’s lives. (loc 2814)

> If it is increasingly difficult for elites to understand the experience of other people’s lives, they are not helped by the fact that statistics are not able to surface the complexities of people’s everyday experiences. Statistics can tell a good story, but they have a limited ability to tell a nuanced human story. The principle instruments that the policymaking and political class depend on to understand the public are opinion polling and focus groups. (loc 2816)

> The team making the 2007 film Ratatouille devoted considerable energy to making sure that the multisensory pleasures of food, as well as the environments in which it is created, could be recreated for their audience. One team spent two weeks eating in Parisian Michelin-starred restaurants and interviewing their chefs. (loc 2939)

> Through acting, they had made implicit knowledge explicit—not only to themselves but to others around them. In creating and then performing their ideas, they had drawn on a reservoir of unspoken understanding. (loc 3156)

> In many organizations, a bundle of Post-it notes and a “brainstorm” is the height of creative practice and the idea of acting out scenarios, performing skits and using props would sound outlandish. However, the commercial success of companies who are thinking with their bodies suggests that the stage is set for the Post-it notes to make way for the theater troupe. We’ve been led to assume that the mind is a wellspring of ideas, creativity, and knowledge, but action creates thought, and this is why design and products that make intuitive sense to people emerge when we put our bodies, and not just our brains, to work.

> However, the commercial success of companies who are thinking with their bodies suggests (loc 3196)

> “Brains do not come as isolated entities as do computers. They come with bodies. Bodies are their interface with the world, and, some would argue, there cannot be thinking without embodiment.” HENRY MARSH (loc 3201)

> Rodney Brooks is one of the leading roboticists of the age and uses a brutally simple definition of intelligence. It is, he suggests, “the sort of stuff that humans do, pretty much all the time.” (loc 3216)

> Another roboticist, Alan Winfield, adopts a similar definition, suggesting that intelligence shows up in the ability of humans and animals to achieve their goals in a wide range of environments. For him it is characterized by the ability to learn, adapt, and apply knowledge in changing environments. The definition may be simple, but the task of creating intelligence, whether in material or immaterial forms, is a very hard one. (loc 3221)

> Intelligence, they suggest, is about adaptability, having the ability to know what to do, and how to do it, in an ever-changing world. (loc 3227)

> In that sense, their view of intelligence has much in common with that of the Canadian evolutionary biologist George Romanes, outlined in his 1882 book Animal Intelligence, that intelligence is an animal’s capacity to adjust its behavior in accordance with its conditions. (loc 3228)

> Roboticists and AI researchers have discovered that this issue of environmental adaptability is at the heart of their efforts and addressing it depends on how one understands the operation of intelligence (loc 3230)

> In the 1980s, AI research began to be infused with the philosophical thinking of phenomenologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Hubert Dreyfus. Dreyfus was an outspoken critic of the field, whose 1979 book What Computers Can’t Do irritated his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a prestigious center of research into AI and robotics. The book’s reception is reputed to have precipitated his move to the West Coast of the United States. He was railing against the obsession with trying to simulate cognition without regard for the situated nature of intelligence—the fact that it arises in agents who are in and of the world. Instead, he maintained, the boosters of AI were assuming that “all intelligent behavior can be simulated by a device whose only mode of information processing is that of a detached, disembodied, objective observer.” (loc 3261)

> A cockroach has one million neurons compared to a human’s one hundred billion, so the considerable intelligence it exhibits, roboticists started to see, must be in no small part due to its intricate system of sensors and its locomotive system. This insight had a huge impact on the study of intelligence. What if “higher” forms of intelligence do not exist “in the head” but derive from and depend on the “lower” intelligence of the body? (loc 3284)


> Rodney Brooks is credited with establishing the wonderfully named field of “nouvelle AI,” and although his career has been focused on building robots, his work has been instrumental in the development of AI and his fascination with insects has been a driving force behind it. (loc 3287)


> Herbert Simon once suggested that just because an environment is complex, it doesn’t mean that an agent operating successfully within it is also complex. Questioning whether the apparently intelligent behavior of an ant weaving its way along a beach was a reflection of the complexity of its environment or its own internal “cognitive” complexity, he coined a phrase which has come to be known as Simon’s Law: “An ant, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent complexity of its behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environment in which it finds itself.” The point of Simon’s rule is to suggest that things which seem complex often appear so as a result of their complex environment. (loc 3343)

> What he had done was take an understanding of how insects learn about the world around them to create a different perspective, not only on what constitutes intelligence but on how it can be given material form. Intelligence, he was showing, doesn’t require or equate with explicit reasoning systems; it emerges from and depends on experiences that can be learned in an iterative manner, and having experiences requires a body. (loc 3352)


> The field of robotics made its advances because it left behind the idea of disembodied cognition and instead realized that thinking happens in complex environments in the pursuit of practical ends and that cognition depends upon the experience that comes from having a body, with an ability to sense the world and act in it. Our minds extend into our bodies and also into the world around us: thinking is an embodied and situated activity. (loc 3367)


> It is true that advances in AI over recent years have been staggering, but it is worth remembering what hasn’t been achieved and what might never be accomplished. A focus on the body can help us see the potential limits to AI and why it might be legitimate to think of the absence of embodiment as the single constraining factor in its development. (loc 3469)


> Humans are able to spot a face they recognize in a crowd with ease yet without understanding how. We can walk around a room, recognize objects, pick them up and, using incredibly fine-tuned skills, manipulate them to achieve remarkable things. We can ride bikes and drive cars. We can read the mood of a meeting, sense other people’s emotional states, and engage in conversations, even when confronted with a bewildering array of dialects, accents, or languages. These skills represent some of the hardest engineering problems that we can conceive of, but humans can handle them without giving them much thought. In very large part this is due to the fact of our embodiment. It is also the case because our sensory and motor skills have been developed over a billion years, whereas the skills of reasoning and abstract thought are a mere one hundred thousand years old. As Moravec remarks, “the deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much more powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge.” Our embodiment is the older and more significant factor in our intelligence, and what makes it hard to reproduce. (loc 3479)

> However, the idea that intelligence is not possible without a body that inhabits the world should give us some encouragement. It is the body that enables the distinctively human abilities of sense-making and pattern recognition, not to mention our locomotive and sensorimotor capabilities, and these skills are a long way from being surpassed. It is these bodily capabilities which enable the day-to-day intelligence that humans exhibit, and that is really hard to reproduce. (loc 3492)


> We have encountered two important paradoxes over the course of this book. The first is Polanyi’s assertion that “we know more than we can tell,” the idea that human intelligence extends further than can ever be captured by any finite set of words, symbols or representations. His point is not only that much human knowledge is ineffable, but that it is dynamic and contextual, which puts understanding it beyond the reach of machines. The second, Moravec’s paradox, reminds us that humans have skills of perception and manipulation that far exceed those of machines. Computers can wipe the floor with the best humans at chess, and they can crunch data more quickly than the best mathematicians, advances that should be celebrated for what they make possible. However, the “low-level” skills of perception and manipulation are domains where there isn’t the faintest sign that emerging technologies come close to matching human capabilities. (loc 3518)

> Taken together, the tacit nature of embodied knowledge and the perceptive, manipulative skills that are part of our embodiment bestow tremendous advantage on humans. We should celebrate the social intelligence this gives us and what it enables: the ability to learn and retain skills, the capacity to connect with others and handle novel and ambiguous situations, and the intuition to make decisions. Most profoundly, our embodiment is at the heart of how we create and make sense of a meaning-filled world. (loc 3525)

> We are frequently told that machines and AI are about to change the world forever, but we should take comfort from the idea that our embodiment is what makes our intelligence hard to reproduce. Our bodies give us an advantage that we should celebrate rather than ignore—they are our superpower, and we should celebrate them. (loc 3529)
