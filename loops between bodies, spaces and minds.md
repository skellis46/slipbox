# loops between bodies, spaces and minds

In this podcast Ezra Klein interviews Annie Murphy Paul, the author of _The Extended Mind_.[@paul-2021-extended]. They discuss an idea fundamental to [[4e cognition]] in which information and ideas loops back and forth between our minds, the spaces (and materials) around us, and other people's mind. This is the concept of how "brain, body, and environment are coupled or integrated."[@newen-2018-4e p.4]

> And so when we think of ourselves as loopy creatures, we can kind of create those loops where we’re passing information and ideas in and out of these different domains — the body, spaces, other people’s minds — and then back through our own heads. And that’s a much more fertile and generative way of dealing with information than just always keeping it inside our own heads where it’s not going to be changed or altered or improved in any way.[Murphy Paul, in @klein-2021-this n.pag.]

_thoughts & links:_

- I'm drawn to the word _loopy_ (and perhaps how it is distinct from, or similar to recursion -- see [[technological forces and recursion]]). 
 - [[Murphy Paul - The Extended Mind]]
 - [[4e cognition]]
 - [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]]
