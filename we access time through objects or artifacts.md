# we access time through objects or artifacts

_previous note:_ [[technics as a process of exteriorization]]

> And while I haven’t read Stiegler, I do know, thanks to Daniel Ross’s time-saving gloss of his work, that Stiegler critiques Heidegger for failing to acknowledge that our access to the past and future is mediated through technics; that we access time through objects or artifacts.

- in which way is Mattern using the word technics? Assume that she uses it in the same way as Stiegler (but not clear to me the lineage in relation to how Stiegler used Mumford's thinking).
