# emotion, affect and internal bodily awareness

_previous note:_ [[interoception as fundamental feature of embodiment]]

> central to the experience of emotion and affective states is, first, an internal awareness of the state of the body (Damasio & Carvalho, 2013). Damasio and Carvalho (2013) suggest that changes to the body will result in both automatic physiological responses and feelings, also described as ‘mental experiences of body states’ (p. 143). Any deviations from homeostasis are detected by the interoceptive system within the body, with descriptions of feelings then being in reference to one's internal state.
