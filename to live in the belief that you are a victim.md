# to live in the belief that you are a victim

_previous note:_ [[two conditions for your mind]]

> In the Dhammapada, an ancient text, the Buddha observes how painful it is to live in the belief that you are a victim and observes, too, what it is like to live without such a belief. “ ‘He insulted me, he harmed me, he robbed me, he beat me’; if you think like this, you will suffer. ‘He insulted me, he harmed me, he robbed me, he beat me’; if you do not think like this, you will not suffer.”[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 14: There's Nothing I Dislike: On Avoiding Bad Art n.pag.]
