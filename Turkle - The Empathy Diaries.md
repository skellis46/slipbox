#  Turkle - The Empathy Diaries 

> I experienced something I had already begun exploring in my research: how science and technology can make us forget what we know about life.

Life is important in this writing. That relationship is important. 

> The course had a message: Use concrete events to think about large ideas. Use large ideas to think about concrete events. The best learning follows from looking at specific events through competing theoretical prisms, although some will work better than others. This meant that you didn’t have to be a Marxist to think that certain of Marx’s ideas were well suited for understanding key historical moments. So no matter what your politics, put Marx in your tool kit. Not to criticize him but to use him. The same went for Freud. Read theorists constructively. Because you weren’t swearing allegiance to any theorist, you should read all of them for their best ideas.
> I came of age as an academic in the sixties and seventies, during a tsunami of ideology. When I presented papers and submitted them for publication, I would be asked to choose between strands of Marxism and schools of psychoanalytic thought. Through my education and professional life, I have been sustained by Sam Beer. Use the theory that is most useful for sorting through a time, a place, a new set of materials. Expand your intellectual tool kit. Be theoretically promiscuous. In more academic language, practice theoretical pluralism.

> In other words: Your mother is ill. She is bravely fighting her illness. Her medications make it hard for her to focus. She can no longer keep up with the things that let her function in her life—like keeping her teaching job at Lincoln, for which she needs to take these night credits. So she is turning to you, for whom writing a paper about the plight of French youth is not so big a deal. Don’t embarrass her. Do this out of love. She doesn’t have a lot of time.
> That was what I refused to read. When we don’t want to know the truth, we don’t hear the truth spoken to us.

> People hear a slogan and find that it gets them thinking. Ideas become what the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss called “objects to think with.” They get picked up, sometimes in bits and pieces, and are used to propel action. And affiliation. I thought about this kind of study as “a sociology of superficial knowledge”—with the caveat that this knowledge is never superficial in the life of the individual.

> For my thesis, I would take a group of prominent French thinkers and analyze what they had written about May. My hypothesis: When intellectuals looked at the May events, they could see only what their previous theories suggested would occur.
> And indeed, I found that if you read someone’s work before May, you could predict what they would say about May. Bureaucratic dysfunction. A sclerotic educational system. The expression of a new working class. The May events were a Rashomon story. How we prepare ourselves to see the world determines the world we see. When, later, I found engineers approaching human problems with engineering solutions, their narrowness of vision did not surprise me. They were acting in the same tradition as the sociologists and political scientists who projected their pet theories onto May.

> Victor Turner agreed to be my official adviser. I was fortunate because his emphasis was on how the Fundamentals Exam could help me develop my own intellectual identity. I encourage every graduate student to use this big question to think about their generals exam. It can seem daunting or pretentious when you are just starting out, but it’s the right question. 

> Foucault, too, made the familiar strange. When we fill out bureaucratic forms, we are being shaped into the kind of subjects the modern state needs us to be. Prisoners and patients play their restricted roles because a guard or psychiatrist might always be watching, even if no one is watching at that very moment. Foucault was with me when I turned my attention to life on the screen. Online, we perform a self because we always imagine ourselves seen.

- dance like no one is watching 


> Riesman’s classic work, The Lonely Crowd, was an attempt to understand what lay beneath a particular American loneliness. Riesman encouraged my interest in psychoanalysis. He himself had been analyzed by Erich Fromm, a sociologist who had received analytic training in Vienna. Riesman reworked the postwar warnings of Fromm, who believed that, in America, people see themselves as commodities and find their identities by looking to the opinions of other people. In Riesman’s formulation, Americans were once inner-directed. Now they had become other-directed, seeking identity in external validation.

> I had this idea of other-direction in mind when, later in my career, I turned to studying the new culture growing up around social media. On social media, people talked about authenticity but curated a carefully constructed public self, a self for Facebook or Instagram. I framed it as a new psychology of “I share, therefore I am” and called it “other-direction brought to a higher power.” I wrote my book Alone Together at the dawn of the age of texting. I wrote Reclaiming Conversation when people were fleeing face-to-face encounters for the safety of social media. In these works, I wanted to revisit the ideas of The Lonely Crowd in the era of digital culture. Where my research was hopeful, it pointed in directions that were low-tech. If we had lost ourselves to the alienation of our screens, there was evidence that the immediacy of face-to-face conversation could be a talking cure.


> We read Freud’s “The Uncanny” and talked about computing machines as sitting on the boundary between things alive and not alive. We read the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott on transitional objects. These are the objects of the playroom (the teddy bear, the bits of silk from a blanket) that children treat as though they were part of their own bodies and also separate from them. They are in a space betwixt and between self and not-self. Later in life we have experiences—sexual, artistic, creative, and spiritual—that bring us back to the feelings associated with those early objects. The compelling nature of programming, that feeling of getting lost in code, seemed to have something of the power of transitional objects. In programming, people get involved, body and mind.
- what is this object to these girls? Getting lost. 

> The worst thing, to Seymour, was to give children a computer that presented them only with games or opaque applications.

- opaque applications. But it's stronger than this. A hand is reaching out to choreograph them. 

> Take recursion. It means, most simply, that you define a thing in terms of itself. But again and again, I watched people sit down at a computer, create a program that could go on forever, and quite simply freak out. Meeting recursion was like looking at objects of infinite regress, contemplating horizons, trying to find the end of the stars, all of these experiences that frighten and fascinate children—and adults.[@turkle-2021-empathy Chapter 16: Building 20, n.pag.]

> But the engineering aesthetic (you can understand everything; you can get everything to work with greater efficiency and less friction) runs into trouble when you use it to think about people and their social relationships. To understand people, the most important step often involves stopping to appreciate that you have a story with at least two points of view. There may not be measurements at all. The most relevant data may be feelings. Feelings aren’t friction free but conflict ridden.

> This new Apple presented the user with a simulated desktop and icons on a screen—representations of file folders, documents, a trash can—that offered nothing to suggest how their underlying structure could be known. The system told you to stay on the surface and to take things at interface value. When the world comes to us in simulation, we lose a sense of what lies beneath. And we learn to not care. The Macintosh gave more than a sleeker path to get things done. It introduced a new way to think. Apple called its interface “transparent.” But this transparency was what we used to mean when we said “opacity.”
- share with discourse?

> Our capacity for solitude is undermined as soon as we introduce a screen. Screens not only distract us but encourage us to look to others for our sense of self. What is lost when this new circle draws us in? Attention to others. Attention to oneself. The capacity for solitude without stimulation—which is where the capacity for empathy is born. We can’t relate to others until we are comfortable with ourselves. That’s a psychoanalytic first principle: If you don’t teach your children to be alone, they’ll only know how to be lonely.

> The way we live now is an experiment in which we are the human subjects—treated as objects by the technology we have created. Our apps use us as much as we use our apps.
> We are treated as objects when we are swept up as data to be bought and sold on an international market. Or when our attention is manipulated by our devices, not just to keep us glued to them but to determine what we read, what images we see, and what programs get to see us. We reduce ourselves to objects when we are addressed by machine-generated text or voices, because to be understood, we can only respond in ways that such objects can understand. When we are treated as objects, we are encouraged to objectify one another and, of course, ourselves.
