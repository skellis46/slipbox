# a case for writing in practice-research

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

In Chapter 8 of _Strange Tools_ (called _See Me if You Can!_) Alva Noë takes on the idea that art should or can not be explained; that if you do so (or attempt to do so) somehow that art work is reduced or spoiled, or its spell is broken. He uses jokes as an anology for the problem (something he does a lot in the book) -- that there is a distinction between getting a joke, and a conversation about that joke:

>The question _Why is this funny?_ is always appropriate, even if it can be difficult to answer adequately. And even if comprehending such an explanation is no substitute for the spontaneous achievement of the understanding in which getting a joke consists. The point is, the explaining, the talking, the laying out of the logic of the joke is not in direct competition with getting it and laughing. You don’t make someone laugh through explanation. And so, for these reasons, you can’t ruin a joke by talking about it.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 8, n.p.]

Perhaps this analogy also holds for the role of writing in #practice-research. That the words are not able to do any of the work of the art practice itself, but rather are there to draw it into conversation, to build and communicate discursive understandings.

_questions & thoughts:_

- perhaps this accounts for how practice-research can exist both as 'artwork + writing' and 'artwork alone'. That there are two epistemological actions or premises in play (but that they are distinct). What is key with the 'artwork + writing' version is that it is much more able to directly engage in conversations in the research community
