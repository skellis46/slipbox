# are you sure?

_previous note:_ [[alive or dead? I'm not saying]]

> We have to know which wrong perceptions cause us to suffer. Please calligraph the sentence, "Are you sure?" on a piece of paper and tape it to your wall. Love meditation helps us learn to look with clarity and serenity in order to improve the way we perceive.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.23]
