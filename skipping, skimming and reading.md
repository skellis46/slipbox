> Before I 'skim' I usually do this.

> I use the word/concept index at the end of the book to help me with see what might be fluff or identify parts I want to focus more on.

> I read the table of contents really slowly, maybe not slowly but super relaxed (sipping-a-mint-tea-on-the-side type of relaxed) , usually make a mindmap of what I am planning in my journal, some soft background music.

1. I cross off any chapters that don't interest me
2. I mark chapters that interest me
3. I mark chapters that I think might be above my understanding
4. I see maybe there are parts that already fit with my other notes

1. - gets a glance. 
- after the glance I either skip it entirely 
- or 80/20 it (skim/focus)

2. - 50% focus / 50% skim

3. - gets a glance, to see if it maybe belongs at (1) or (2), 
- if it belongs at  (3)
- I will 80(focus)/20(skim) it and mark it for re-reading afterwards if it is really crucial.

> This is NOT a fixed lists of steps! I only numbered them to give some examples.

> - sometimes I might process (3) before (2) sometimes the other way 

> - or I will process (3) a week later after having gathered more material about it.

> If the things I am reading are CRUCIAL to my survival and wellbeing (health/work/social etc) then I might not skim at all and go full process mode.

> since I have done most that already, I rarely come across something I find important enough to not skim, but it does happen occasionally where I have to go deep into things for months and even dream about it .

> the most important part for me in this process was getting to a point of not feeling bad about skipping/skimming. and thats happened only after much skimming and feeling bad and self-reflection ğŸ¤£
