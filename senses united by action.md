# senses united by action

Tversky describes the ways in which the sensory experiences of babies are disconnected; what they hear, see and feel are unlinked. Their senses are brought together gradually as they develop through a feedback loop of action and sensation: working with the senses together depends on "doing, seeing and feeling"[@tversky_mind_2019 Chapter 1: The Space of the Body] while receiving feedback from those actions at the same time. This process of calibrating "perception through action" occurs in adults as well. Our senses do not function unless we are acting and moving: "seeing in the absence of acting doesn't change perception".[@tversky_mind_2019 Chapter 1: The Space of the Body]

Tversky calls this the _Second Law of Cognition: Action molds perception_.

_questions & thoughts:_

- previous note: [[action is the foundation of thought]]
- really worth investigating feedback loops and how they are described in somatic practices
- [[loops between bodies, spaces and minds]]
- anything on somatics and perception
- useful to compare with Alva NoÃ«'s work
- [[vision is kinaesthetic]]
- [[somatic feedback interrupts habits]]
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
