# an image is a call

_previous note:_ [[viola - image of the inner state]]

In February of 2020 I went to listen to [Romeo Castellucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_Castellucci) in conversation with [Joe Kelleher](https://pure.roehampton.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/joe-kelleher) at Roehampton University. I took some rather rough notes (which I've included at the bottom of this post) but I was really taken by something Castellucci said:

> an image is a call ... it can call you by your name. ... I cannot create anything, they are already here. I combine. The images belong to everyone. 


## rough notes from 19 February 2020, Roehampton Theatre Department

Joe Kelleher: "faith that hasn't become dogma yet"
RC talked about the chemistry of making.

> It is always completely wrong to transfer philosophical thought into art.
> We [society] are disappointed with the artist so we turn to the artisan.

"getting closer to my bones" (losing weight)
"we were fascinating" (not fascinated)
> an image is a call ... it can call you by your name. ... I cannot create anything, they are already here. I combine. The images belong to everyone. 

> You have to make a hole in the side of an image that you can pass through. 
> The most important thing in theatre is to hide things, not to reveal.
Talking about working with animals: "black hole in the fabric of the fiction"

> epopteria (ancient greek): the act of seeing that  produces the thing. (the word in modern greek now means "overseeing")
> the power of literality

electro-accoustic music -- the music that manipulates the real (through recordings of the real). relationship to the real.

> our duty is to protect the strangeness of theatre ... (in relation to not liking rehearsal or rehearsing actors)

working with people: I am in service to them.

> art has nothing to do with communication. I hate this word. We share something with human beings. 
> go and see the classical art, not the contemporary. Do not read about art and dramaturgy.
> I am inside the painting, inside the frame ... the geometry (talking about his background as a visual artist inspired by classical painting)
