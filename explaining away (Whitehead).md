# explaining away (Whitehead)

_previous note:_ [[Bridle - Ways of Being]]

- this link above is to something Bridle says about abstraction

Alfred North Whitehead warned that a corollary of abstraction is an effect he called _explaining away_ [Whitehead, in @mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49]. When we treat abstractions as something concrete "everything that does not fit into the schema is denied the status of proper existence" [@mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49] -- it is explained away. Abstractions make invisible anything that does not fit our model of the world. 

See also  re abstractions: "denied the status of proper existence":

> In a similar way, the operations of AI depend on datafication: the presentation of the world as data separated out from the continuity of experience. Unfortunately, one corollary of abstraction is the effect that philosopher of science Alfred North Whitehead criticized as ‘explaining away’: by treating abstractions as something concrete, everything that does not fit into the schema is denied the status of proper existence (Whitehead, 1997). The error comes from treating abstractions as more real than phenomena. This kind of reified abstraction is a key mechanism of instrumental rationalities like AI – the trick that allows it to see only that which can be made useful and ignore the rest.[@mcquillan-2022-resisting p.49]

That small quote is from Whitehead's _Science and the Modern World_.
