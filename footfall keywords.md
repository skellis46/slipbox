# footfall keywords

_previous note:_ [[footfall]]

In thinking about the etymology of[[keywords]] it occurred to me one kind of cipher or code for _Footfall_ might be a) a haiku like [[summer sound (poem)]]; b) a simple list of keywords; or c) some kind of combination in which the keywords are *hidden* within the haiku.

This note is to play with b) a simple list, but it starts with words from the haiku (!). The list is not tightly edited; rather it is more like an initial collection:

- falling
- ground
- Earth
- din
- extinction
- compost
- body 
- gravity
- critical zone: [[sentient performativities - abstract#^2e6eb6]]
- touching
- cosmological time (vs human-measured time) [[the natural world does not question the timing of its birth and death]]
- lapse
- timelapse
- soil
- non-time [[the pivot between being and non-being]]


- "Your body is an ecosystem of ancestors" [[ancestry is not a lineage#^e2246b]]
