# accumulation of local soil and local culture

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]

> However small a landmark the old bucket is, it is not trivial. It is one of the signs by which I know my country and myself. And to me it is irresistibly suggestive in the way it collects leaves and other woodland sheddings as they fall through time. It collects stories, too, as they fall through time. It is irresistibly metaphorical. It is doing in a passive way what a human community must do actively and thoughtfully. A human community, too, must collect leaves and stories, and turn them to account. It must build soil, and build that memory of itself – in lore and story and song – that will be its culture. These two kinds of accumulation, of local soil and local culture, are intimately related. [@berry-2018-worldending] (from 1988 Essay _The work of local culture_)

- the above feels like a different kind of attitude towards memory from the more technologically drive perfect memory. More akin to [[tools for remembering]] in the sense that Berry's bucket has become a tool for remembering. 
- lots of talk of cultural memory in Berry's _World Ending Fire_. At present they are in Obsidian tagged Drafts folder.
