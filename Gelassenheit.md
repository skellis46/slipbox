# Gelassenheit

Hui opens his book _The Question Concerning Technology in China: An Essay in Cosmotechnics_ (2016) with Heidegger's critique of technology as a shift from "_techne_ as _poiesis_ or bringing forth (Hervorbringen) to technology as _Gestell_"[@hui-2016-question p.3]. He suggests that Heidegger's thinking:

>found a receptive audience among Eastern thinkers – most notably in the teachings of the Kyoto School, as well as in the Daoist critique of technical rationality, which identifies Heidegger’s Gelassenheit with the classical Daoist concept of wu wei or 'non-action'.[@hui-2016-question p.3]

Gelassenheit is translated as _releasement_ or _letting go_; "to let things be in whatever may be their uncertainty and their mystery"[^1]

The [wikipedia page on Gelassenheit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#cite_ref-25) suggests that Heidegger borrowed the term from Meister Eckhart. There is a brief essay on Eckhart's use of the term at [hermitary.com/solitude/eckhart.html](http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/eckhart.html).[^2]
