# a continuation of our ancestors

_previous note:_ [[ancestors provide the range of what it is to be human]]

> In the first awareness, we see ourselves as one element in a continuation of our ancestors and as the link to future generations. When we see in this way, we know that by taking good care of our body and consciousness in the present moment, we are taking care of all generations past and future.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.96]
