# losing oneself 2024 practice

This is all from the Notion site working with Michaela Gerussi

## Overview

*Losing Oneself: Dance improvisation, consciousness and nonduality* explores the phenomenology of dance improvisation in dialogue with research into nonduality, flow, interoception and consciousness. It hypothesises that this phenomenology has properties that are distinct from other mindfulness and body awareness practices commonly under investigation in consciousness studies and cognitive science (e.g. Schmalzl, et al. 2014; Pérez-Peña et al. 2022; Mehling 2020; Gibson 2019). The research aims to use dance improvisation as a case study to deepen current understanding of the role of interoception in experiences of nonduality and consciousness in trans-disciplinary research. The research will provide essential pilot data that will inform an external AHRC bid.
