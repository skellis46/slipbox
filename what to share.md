# what to share

_previous note:_  [[connection between question, answer and method]]

I was asked the following question by a reader who is nearing the end of their artistic research PhD:

> I'm in the messy decision making process of how to share practice to close the public aspect of my project ... and what to share for examination alongside the thesis. It's the hardest part for me, surrounded by ideas and possibilities but also thinking "what's the minimal viable product"? What's good enough?

My suggestion is to return to the research questions. It is the clarity of the project's research questions that help determine what to share, how to share and what is enough. This is because as the RQs have emerged with the research methods then they start to act as the spine on which such decision making is built. If the RQs do not help then in my experience this is because they are not clear or precise enough to function in this way. If the questions lack the kind of specificity that is useful, then work and re-work the questions as you wrestle with the question of what to share. The RQs are the spine of the project; they help determine and constrain the limits, possibilities and excesses of the research.

Here's Dirk Vis from _Research for people who (think they) would rather create_ (2021, 1st edition)

> In an ideal world, you would start your research by formulating a research question that is concrete, focused, and limited to a certain time, place and/or (set of) example(s). In reality, this is the exception rather than the rule. You will most likely start with hunches, intuitions and personal fascinations – as 99% of all students find their real research question somewhere along the way, halfway during the process or even at the very end. They find it through preliminary research of a broader topic which they then gradually narrow down. Be prepared to keep formulating and reformulating your preliminary research question, changing it countless times throughout the process – continuously making it more specific. (p.25)

Coincidentally, there's a two day symposium at UniArts Helsinki (and online) this Thursday and Friday (27 and 28 October 2022) with the slightly overlapping theme of making artistic research public: https://www.uniarts.fi/en/events/earn-gathering-making-artistic-research-public/

One more thing. I'd suggest that about 9 out of every 10 artistic research PhDs are too big in the sense of how much *practice* is shared and documented. My experience of these (including my own) is that they are akin to a shotgun approach to research: that is, if you fire enough times you are bound to hit something. In such projects students have failed to contain or gather the research such that the contribution to knowledge is clearly held by the RQs, the methods and what is shared. I've written previously about the relationship between questions, answers and methods here:
