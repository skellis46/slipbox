# Who could ever dream of such a thing?

Human beings now produce (and upload) an extraordinary volume of video, and homemade dance videos are both common and massively popular on social media. 

Imagine an ecosystem in which millions of viruses -- and/or mutations of previous viruses -- called _videos_ are produced every day. How many just on TikTok? How many of these are dances in some way or another? It is we humans that produce these viruses a.k.a. _content_. The system for viral transmission of these videos is what is called _vector transmission_. Instead of mosquitoes carrying malaria, it is humans who transmit these new viruses. We produce _and_ transmit these video-viruses. We don't seem to be overtly harmed by the viruses we produce and transmit, at least not in the short-term. 

Each virus is initially hosted by a mobile phone that has no immune system. Vaccines are irrelevant to a host without an immune system. The viral load of some smartphone-hosts is enormous. Every single virus (not just a tiny percentage) is able to zoonotically spillover to different host operating systems. In other words, these video-viruses are host agnostic, and there is no need for a wet market in this ecosystem. The smartphones-as-hosts are all connected to a vast global network and humans transmit their video-viruses around that network. The viral habitat is therefore social networks. These social networks possess flawless conditions for the viruses, and are almost completely resistant to outside interference or compromise. The social network habitats are constructed and tuned to be addictive to humans because we are the virus producers-transmitters-consumers.[^trinity] The habitats are designed and tweaked to hold our attention. 

[^trinity]: This is like the holy trinity of individualism-juiced consumer capitalism.

The potential weakness of these social network habitats is their reliance on the vector transmission of viruses by humans. That is, if humans stopped passing video-viruses onto others the social-network habitat would sooner or later disappear. The social network habitat is dependent on the presence of viruses; it would not exist without them and this is a curious thing. In other words, the virus is less dependent on the social network habitat than the other way around. Without the habitat the virus still has a host (the mobile phone) and can still be transmitted (through human sharing), but just not at scale. It's still a virus, but less likely to, as we say, _go viral_. 

But all of this, _all_ of this, is made possible by massive corporation-organisms that more or less control the entire ecosystem. These are the leviathans of our time and they are the organisations who own and train the social networks. They are mostly unregulated -- we might say _untouchable_ or _immune_ -- and their system of control is algorithmic. What's more, these organisms have an open secret: each time a human views or transmits a virus, these corporation-organisms extract information from the human transmitters that serves two purposes: a) to increase the desire of humans to produce, transmit and consume more viruses; b) to sustain the leviathan organism by providing it with data that it then sells. These data are bought and used by big and small commercial enterprises to sell more things to humans in part so we will produce more viruses.
