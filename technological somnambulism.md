# technological somnambulism

_previous note:_ [[technics, techne, and technology]]

_Technological somnambulism_ was coined by Langdon Winner.[^1] He proposed that we are  in a "state of sleepwalking in our mediations with technology".[^2] He suggests that the state is caused by three things:

1. We think of technologies as tools separate from ourselves.
2. There is separation between those who make and those who use technology. This separation decreases the likelihood we will care about the effects of using those technologies.
3. When we use technologies we reshape everyday activities and things (with little care for how they are re-shaped) and in so doing create alternative worlds in which we live.
