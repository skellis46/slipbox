# three for society

_previous note:_ [[Turkle - Reclaiming Conversation]]

> [Thoreau] said that in his cabin there were “three chairs—one for solitude, two for friendship, and three for society.” [@turkle-2015-reclaiming Loc 148]

([Readwise Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00SI0B6PC&location=148))

 - thinking of [[authentic movement]] as friendship but noting how it only takes another chair in the room to keep 'society' present.
