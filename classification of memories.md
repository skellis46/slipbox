# classification of memories

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]

From Dark Mountain Volume 23 David Lauer _Seeds of Resistance_

> By contrast, names that reflect classification, greed and death like: Bt176, Starlink, P0075, seek to commodify this spiritual heritage of humankind in order to monopolise gifts of creation in the name of power and profit. [@lauer-2023-seeds p.122]

Lauer is talking about classifying seeds, but made me think about classifying memories. And perhaps extractivism (see [[Kate Rawles - The Life Cycle]] regarding memory. Hard not to think of Total Recall here. 

So, this is really an idea for the perfect memory work -- classifying memories.
