# I never catch myself

_previous note:_ [[Jay L. Garfield - Losing Ourselves]]


> For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call _myself,_ I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch _myself_ at any time without perception, and never can observe anything but the perception.[David Hume in @garfield-2022-losing Chapter 2 Why You Have No Self, n.pag.]

Quote is from David Hume's _A Treatise on Human Nature_, section 1.4.6.3
