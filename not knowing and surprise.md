# not knowing and surprise

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

I happened across the following writing by Henk Borgdorff in Emilie Gallier's remarkable PhD [Reading in Performance, Lire en Spectacle – The solitude or reading merged with the collective nature of an audience](https://www.booksonthemove.fr/produit/reading-in-performance-lire-en-spectacle-the-solitude-or-reading-merged-with-the-collective-nature-of-an-audience/):

> In the debate on the epistemology of artistic research, an antithesis repeatedly surfaces: between explicit, manifest knowledge and implicit or tacit knowledge, and between knowing that something is the case and knowing how to do or make something. I propose to add a third side to this: not knowing. ‘I don’t know ...’ This is the more interesting position: not to know, or not to know yet. It creates room for that which is unthought, that which is unexpected: the idea that all things could be different ... This is what we may call the radical contingency of artistic research.[^1]

Borgdorff's writing reminded me of two things. The first is that [[epistemology starts with fallibility]],[^2] and the second is about surprise as described by Rheinberger:

> If you want to be a productive researcher, you have to conduct your experiments in such a way that you can be surprised by the outcome, so that unexpected things can occur. This only happens if, on the one hand, experiments are precisely set up but, on the other hand, are complex enough to leave the door open for surprise. The magnitude of such surprises is itself constituted in a recursive or iterative loop. It doesn't expose itself in a flash of enlightenment at one particular point in time. That is how people who have effected major breakthroughs in science usually depict their own achievements in hindsight, which I think is due to a self-stylisation that can only come after the fact. The surprises, when they show up for the first time, are of a minor magnitude, and may even make their appearance as contaminations, which is why they often tend to be overlooked. The experimental spirit lies precisely in not overlooking these small effects.[^3]
