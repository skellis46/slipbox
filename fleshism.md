> In the worlds of political, religious and economic man, commitment was outwardly directed to those communal beliefs, practices and institutions that were bigger than the individual and in which the individual, to the degree that he or she conformed to or cooperated with them, found meaning. The ancient Athenian was committed to the assembly, the medieval Christian to his church, and the twentieth-century factory worker to his trade union and working man's club. All of them found their purpose and wellbeing by being committed to something outside themselves. _

> In the world of Psychological Man, however, the commitment is first and foremost to the self and is inwardly directed. Thus, the order is reversed. Outward institutions become in effect the servants of the individual and her sense of inner wellbeing._

> Women, said de Beauvoir, in a famous and era-defining piece of writing, could not be defined by their biology: in fact, they could and should move beyond it. The opening sentence of the second volume of _The Second Sex _could be said to be the manifesto of the current transgender movement: _One is not born, but rather becomes, woman. _With these eight words Simone de Beauvoir, over seventy years ago, opened the door to the mutable, self-defining, internalised and hyper-sexual idea of the human self which is now throwing over the tables across the Western world.

> Take, for example, Martine (formerly Martin) Rothblatt, billionaire transgender businesswoman and prominent technocrat. In his 2011 book [From Transgender to Transhuman: A Manifesto On the Freedom Of Form](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Transgender-Transhuman-Manifesto-Freedom-Form/dp/0615489427), the destination is made explicit. 'Transgenderism', writes Rothblatt, 'is the onramp to transhumanism.' Rothblatt presents the desire to transcend the 'gender binary' as part of the wider process of moving above and beyond all naturally-occurring boundaries and limits. Abandoning gender will lead to abandoning sex and then, finally, to abandoning the body altogether.

>  A similar case is made by the writer Sophie Lewis, whose recent 'cyborg feminist' manifesto [Full Surrogacy Now](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2022/01/return-of-the-cyborgs) (subtitle: _Feminism Against Family_) demands the dismantling of the 'stratified, commodified, cis-normative, neo-colonial' apparatus of 'bourgeois reproduction,' in favour of 'gestational communism': a world where babies are not the particular obligation of their families, but 'universally thought of as anybody and everybody's responsibility', brought up by 'queerer, more comradely modes' of nurturing than the old-fashioned, reactionary 'family.' How is such a paradise to be achieved? Through advanced technologies of surrogacy, artificial wombs and other such means of spawning new humans without having to use our own clumsy bodies to carry them.

> Rothblatt, to his credit, is quite open about what he is ultimately in pursuit of: immortality, via the [uploading](https://terasemfaith.net/user/martinerothblatt/) of the human mind into the digital cloud. Any objection to this notion, you may not be surprised to hear, is now a form of prejudice: one known as [fleshism](https://www.endracism.org/fleshism). One way to overcome it is to follow a new kind of global faith: a 'transreligion,' through which we can navigate the new reality. Rothblatt, helpfully, has even created one for us. Launched in 2004, [Terasem](https://terasemfaith.net/) is a new spiritual path for the coming trans-everything future:

>> We are a transreligion that believes we can live joyfully forever if we build mindfiles for ourselves. We insist on respecting diversity without sacrificing unity, as well as pouring maximum resources into cyberconsciousness software, geoethical nanotechnology and space settlement._
