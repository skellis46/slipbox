# security and surveillance

This writing by David Lyon is called _Liquid Surveillance: The Contribution of Zygmunt Bauman to Surveillance Studies_.

>  But other forms of surveillance, relating for instance to Bauman’s determined effort to theorize consumption, relate not to security but to what he calls ‘‘seduction,’’ to competition, opportunity and governance in the marketplace.[@lyon-2010-liquid p.327]

- seduction: virus! Social media. Seduced. 

> The fear of being caught in the wrong category is a key motif in Bauman’s more recent work. ‘‘Whether in their consciousness or their subconscious, men and women of our times are haunted by the spectre of exclusion’’ (2004a:47). This relates to the sea change that has occurred between the ‘‘social state and the security state’’ in which ‘‘state provisions gradually turned from token’s of citizen’s rights into tools of social exclusion and symptoms…of social stigma’’ (2004b:79). Today, says Bauman, the ‘‘security’’ in questions has little to do with those things promised by Roosevelt (in the United States) or Beveridge (in the United Kingdom), or with our place in society, human dignity and the like, but rather with ‘‘the body and personal belongings’’ (2004b:82). And the insecurities emanate from criminals, asylum seekers, the underclass or from terrorists. These, of course, are some key groups from which the new surveillance will purportedly protect us.[@lyon-2010-liquid p.329]

Curious that there is no exclusion now. No sorting.
