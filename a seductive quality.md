# a seductive quality

You might know that for about the last three years I've been recording a podcast called [Midlifing](https://www.midlifing.net/) with Lee Miller. In 2022 I was in the middle of an artistic residency in the north of Italy and Lee and I recorded an episode called [Three trains and two buses](https://www.midlifing.net/1480717/10789639-84-three-trains-and-two-buses). It's an episode more or less about creativity and making things, but there's also a brief moment when I express the thought that if I tended to dwell anywhere it is in the past rather than the future. 

You can listen to the 20 or so seconds here.

And then of course there are the various ways in which we might reify the present. Here's Jon Kabat-Zinn from his 2004 book _Wherever You Go, There You Are_:

> To find our way, we will need to pay more attention to this moment. It is the only time that we have in which to live, grow, feel, and change. We will need to become more aware of and take precautions against the incredible pull of the [Scylla and Charybdis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Scylla_and_Charybdis) of past and future, and the dreamworld they offer us in place of our lives.

There's a website called [Dear Photograph](https://dearphotograph.com/) – perhaps you are familiar with it? In it people submit photographs of someone (normally themselves) holding up a photograph in the place in which it was originally taken. 


The images and thoughts are very touching and for the most part I feel  moved by the sentiments. These are people reaching back in time, expressing their sadness, dreams, mistakes and hopes. Often there is deep loss and yearning in the words and images. 


Listening back to the Midlifing episode while writing this, I was reminded of the idea that the difference between memory and nostalgia is that memory comes to us, and we _reach_ for nostalgia. But I am not so sure of this now, even though I'd describe my relationship to nostalgia as ambivalent. Too often it is used as a strategy to sell us something, and it has a seductive quality that is all too easy to get lost in. Yet, for me, Dear Photograph seems to touch nostalgia as lightly as is necessary to give me space to examine my own relationship to the past, to time and to change.
