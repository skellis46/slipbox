# trusting internal authority

_previous note:_ [[develop inner authority by listening to the body]]

> While it was true that my empty stomach and my hunger had inspired me to choose a variety of dishes before I sat down to eat, during the meal, my senses and perceptions were communicating to me that I was full. My internal authority said stop eating, but the external authority of a surrogate parental figure who apparently had the right to tell me what to do, made it clear that I should not trust my own internal authority but rather submit to his. In a sense—while I do not think this overtly affected my future relationship to food—I was being trained not to trust myself. It was a moment that could have had serious repercussions. It could have been the beginning of an eating disorder. [@schwartz-2014-this p.316]
