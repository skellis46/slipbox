# slowing down and simply feeling for a moment

_previous note:_ [[sensation, attention, awareness, perception, action and feeling]]

> There are times in conversation when slowing down and simply feeling for a moment can be extremely helpful. It is sometimes relieving to pause and turn our attention directly to the body, noticing just the physical sensations. We can ask ourselves, Where are the sensations located? What is their texture or qualities? How they are moving or changing? Once sensation is experienced directly, we can ask for the name of the feeling, eliciting words like fear, anger, or sadness.
