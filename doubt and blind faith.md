# doubt and blind faith

_previous note:_ [[truth and beliefs]]

---

Heffernan writes of how quickly some predictions or forecasts are absorbed as facts. Her example is about how many jobs it is suggested will be lost to AI:

>Instead of appearing unknown, debatable and uncertain, suddenly the future looked foreclosed. In that guise, it becomes propaganda. When we trade the effort of doubt and debate for the ease of blind faith, we become gullible and exposed, passive and irresponsible observers of our own lives. Worse still, we leave ourselves wide open to those who profit by influencing our behaviour, our thinking and our choices. At that moment, our agency in our own lives is in jeopardy.

I like this phrase "effort of doubt and debate".

_questions & thoughts:_

- am reminded here of Shoshana Zuboff's writing particularly in relation to our futures

_consider:_

- [[heterotopic discourse and the truth]]
- [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]]
- [[negative capability]]
