# a conscious span of fourteen generations

_previous note:_ [[Murmurings of the Land]]

> If you see yourself in this moment as the intended and unintended consequence of things that were undertaken and decided and aborted, seven generations ago. You see yourself mostly as consequence, not agent. How did you happen? Not just your look, your disposition. But the whole crazy thing that coalesced for the moment and turned into you. How many threads, fibers and fractals? If you can do that, you're in the game now I think. But this requires you have a conscious span of fourteen generations, not seven. And you're a conduit for the back and forth rush between them all. That's how you figure out what you should do, I think.
