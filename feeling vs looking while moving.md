# feeling vs looking while moving

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

![[mindful-walking.mp3]]

The audio is above with full transcription below but drawing attention here to the difference between watching and feeling language:

>  Instead of watching the movement or observing the movement, it was simply to feel the movement, to feel the sensations of the movement. And in the feeling language, that's from the inside.

This is absurdly obvious for any somatically-trained mover but I enjoyed hearing how strong the realisation was for Goldstein. But it also relates strongly to nonduality and how (as a matter of direct experience) corporeal sensations are fundamental in consciousness. Keeping this in mind for [[losing one's self]].


## transcription

00:00
Joseph Goldstein: One of the, one of the, how to say, it's kind of an insight or, or, or just an understanding of how, how to be mindful in movement. I had a real shift of understanding. This is many years ago now, but it made a huge difference in my walking practice and not only walking practice, but just being mindful of the body throughout the day.

00:30
And that is very often in meditative language, we use watching language, you know, watch, notice, observe, note, you know. So the language we often use suggests that we're somewhere up in the head looking at the object. And this is stressful because then it's always, it's like we're trying to

00:59
It's like we're trying to track what's happening, and the mind slips off, and then we try to get back in the process. So what happened ...

Sam Harris: Also it reinforces the apparent position of an observer in the head that's now trying to get closer to phenomenon that are out there somewhere in your extremities, or you're in the head trying to get closer to the sensations in your foot when you're doing walking meditation.

01:28
JG: Correct. That's exactly the problem. So what happened was, and this was an amazing shift. I started instead of using that kind of watching language, even to myself internally, I started reframing it. Instead of watching the movement or observing the movement, it was simply to feel the movement, to feel the sensations of the movement. And in the feeling language, that's from the inside.

01:57
It's not as if we're outside looking at the object. When we're feeling something, we're actually in the body, feeling it from the inside, and that's what made it really very effortless and joyful. You know, it's something like maybe how people would might practice Tai Chi or yoga. You know, where the emphasis is on being in the body and feeling it. And I just found this hugely helpful

02:27
in the walking practice. And as I say, it made it very easeful and delightful. 

SH: Nice, nice. Yeah. It can take longer to connect with walking as a practice. I mean, I don't know. I mean, you'd have much more information about this than than I would. But I just remember that I don't think it was until the middle of my first 10 day retreat, or I realized, you know, just

02:56
experientially that walking was every bit as deep a practice as sitting. And I don't know how common that delay is, but I was surprised to kind of punch through to a layer where it was just, okay, part of my mind was assuming that the walking was a break from the sitting or just at least a necessary way to rest the body so that you just don't break down sitting 12 to 14 hours a day. But

03:24
you know, it's, there's no question. It's precisely the same practice. 

JG: Exactly. So you, you probably were at that first retreat before I had come to this great insight ...

SH: You were there and there were at least five days of negligence on your part of the picture. I'm going to figure out how to bill you for it. 
JG: Because what I, what I found that, and again, this is, I get a lot of reports back when people do make this shift to simply feeling the movement

03:55
it becomes very accessible, very easeful. And I think then people connect with the walking as a practice, uh, much more quickly and to just emphasize what you just said for myself, even now when I'm on retreat, in some way, the walking, there's often more insight in the walking than in the sitting. Yeah. I wouldn't want to make that an absolute statement, but it's just to emphasize that it is extremely illuminating. And that

04:24
people definitely should not make a hierarchy between sitting and walking. And as you say, it's all equal. 

SH: Yeah, and also it perhaps connects the practice to the rest of life even more directly because you're always getting up and moving around and transitioning from one activity to the next. And if you can make all of those transitional moments a species of walking meditation,

04:55
it knits together real life with practice and blurs the non-existent line between formal practice and the rest of life. 

JG: Yeah, no, that's exactly... Sam, you should teach this stuff. 

SH: Yeah, I'm trying. 

JG: That's perfect. 

SH: We do what we can over here, Joseph.
