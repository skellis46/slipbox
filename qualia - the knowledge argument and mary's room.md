# qualia - the knowledge argument and mary's room

_previous note:_ [[harris - conscious]]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument

_chatGPT summary:_

7 Dec 2023 prompt: Can you please summarise the knowledge argument and Mary's Room in less than 50 words.

> The knowledge argument and Mary's Room thought experiment propose that physical truths do not encompass all forms of knowledge. Mary, a scientist who knows everything physical about color but has never experienced it, learns something new upon seeing color, suggesting experiential knowledge is distinct from physical knowledge.

and please add what this has to do with qualia

> The knowledge argument and Mary's Room highlight "qualia," the subjective, individual experiences of perception. Mary's new knowledge upon seeing color demonstrates qualiaâ€”experiences that cannot be fully understood through objective, physical information alone, emphasizing a gap between physical facts and conscious experience.
