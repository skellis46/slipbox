# The principle of truth and limited claims

Even given the principle of mess and the epistemic openness of how art functions, the truth matters.

> It is the search for truth that underpins research. Search and search again. Research is continually conducted in the dark [@ingold-2018-search n.pag.]. 

Yet in my experience the danger of epistemic openness without rigorous and humble searching and re-searching means that practice researchers are liable to fall into the trap of saying anything they want about their artistic practices. 

In practice research what claims or new insights can be made and on what basis? What are the limits of such claims? An academic claim "is considered debatable or up for inquiry" [@nordquist-2020-what n.pag.]. But I do not see such debates happening in practice research. 

There is a vicious circle of epistemology in which there are no limits to the claims made on behalf of practice research, which means there are no grounds to debate such claims, which means there are no limits to the claims, etc.

Perhaps this principle demands epistemic humility on the part of artist-scholars; reaching for the truth while avoiding the hubris of unwarranted claims.
