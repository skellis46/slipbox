# Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living

This is an article by the humanities professor Alan Jacobs written for The New Atlantis. In it Jacobs discusses the [[standard critique of technology]] and how he has used it to make a case for rejecting walled gardens online for digital commons of the open web. He describes, however, how the SCT is powerless "to slow our technosocial momentum, much less to alter its direction"[@jacobs-2021-tech p.26].

He discusses the rise of [[Postman's technopoly]], the progress of which has been made inevitable by three global capitalist trends: Moore's Law, lithium mining and the spread of wireless telecommunications networks. He describes how [[technopoly in the west deploys carrots rather than sticks]] -- the key carrot being advertising -- and Kingsnorth's conception of the [[human industrial economy]] which considers the technopoly in relation to the entire natural world. One such way to conceive of our changing relationship to the natural world is through [[Gerd-Günter Voß's three conducts of life]]. He discusses the important role Heidegger has in the [[standard critique of technology]], [[Heidegger's standing reserve]] and, of course, [[gestell and enframing]]. 

>This technological enframing of human life, says Heidegger, first “endanger\[s\] man in his relationship to himself and to everything that is” and then, beyond that, “banishes” us from our home. And that is a great, great peril.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

Jacobs' proposal draws on Yuk Hui's work, and in particular [[Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]] and how cosmotechnics is the point at which "a way of life is realized through making."[@jacobs-2021-tech p.33] He goes further into Hui's thinking, and suggests that Daoism -- a unification of making and living as exemplified in [[the Dao of butchering cows]] -- and the Daoist sage provides a way to consider a different kind of relationship to the technopoly: 

>The particular tone of the sage’s skepticism is ironic, and the sage is in some essential sense an ironist, but his irony is always directed primarily toward himself. Indeed, this is precisely why people should seek him out to govern them: His primary qualification for office is the gently humorous attitude he takes toward himself, which then extends outward toward our technological “enframing” of the world.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.40]
