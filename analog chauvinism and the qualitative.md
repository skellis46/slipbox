# analog chauvinism and the qualitative

Alexander Galloway's post is a response to Brian Massumi's book _99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value: A Postcapitalist Manifesto_. Galloway includes a playful rant about being able to spot digital philosophers, and also that "analog philosophers are observable in the wild."[@galloway-2020-massumi n.pag] He describes Massumi's penchant for marveling at the complexity and beauty of the world as "awesomeology", and links it to Massumi's "deep skepticism toward anything digital, particularly number and quantity."[@galloway-2020-massumi n.pag] Galloway gives the following example from Massumi's book of this link between awesomeology and skepticism towards numbers: 

>Quantification involves generalization. ... The registering of the qualitative by the quantitative is by nature reductive. ... There is an essential excess of difference, complexity, process, flow, and co-motion on the side of the qualitative that is never entirely absorbed into quantitative ordering. There is much that escapes conversion. There is a left-over of changeable qualities, of liveliness, that does not count, and remains unaccounted for.[@massumi-2018-99 pp.48-49]

Galloway attempts to understand Massumi's "pro-analog prejudice" in the form of a [matheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheme): R > N -- the real is superior to the natural.

>Here I'm taking a cue from number theory, specifically the continuum of the _real_ numbers (ℝ) versus the discrete quantification of the _natural_ numbers (ℕ).[@galloway-2020-massumi n.pag]

>Massumi's matheme gives quality an absolute priority over quantity. It favors affect over number. It denigrates the monad and the unit, while elevating the incommensurable and immeasurable. Massumi's principle asserts that the real will always be richer, livelier, sexier, more poetic, more authentic, more dazzling than anything like number, name, concept, or law.[@galloway-2020-massumi n.pag]

Galloway sees his matheme description of Massumi as "the core belief that lies behind all analog chauvinism. It's one of the fundamental axioms of analog philosophy."[@galloway-2020-massumi n.pag]

I really like Galloway's use of the word chauvinism here. Here's the [wikipedia definition of chauvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism): 

>**Chauvinism** is the irrational belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people, who are seen as strong and virtuous, while others are considered weak or unworthy.

_thoughts & links:_

- [[phonocentrism and the really real]]
- [[the really real]] - this almost appears to be an extension or exaggeration of Galloway's use of _real numbers_ in his matheme. The real isn't enough, we need the really real.
- compare with [[borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology]] and "insertion of machinery between humanity and reality".
- and also in [[kerr - borgmann on merton]] in how devices distance us "from reality"
