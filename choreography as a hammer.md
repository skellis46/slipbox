# choreography as a hammer

Choreographers see choreography everywhere. Strangely, we often use the word in two distinct ways that are not how the word is conventionally used.

The first is in noticing everyday behaviours and patterns and describing these as choreographic. David Hinton's film [_Birds_ (2000)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02hs7wv), and his later collaboration with Siobhan Davies [_All This Can Happen_ (2013)](https://vimeo.com/223111385) both use found footage to reveal or pay attention to this kind of _choreography_.  It doesn't seem that different from how John Cage so precisely sought to "liberate the voices of ordinary things"[^kay] by understanding all sounds (and silence) to be music. This first sense of choreography is also how I might choose to look at this [timelapse of a herd of sheep](https://youtu.be/jVz_HeweTLU)[^swiss] by Lior Fattal. Where people just see patterns, choreographers call them _choreographies_. 

The second sense is choreography as a form of control: how humans are shepherded into particular ways of moving and behaving. This is what the choreographer [Deborah Hay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Hay) means when she says that humans are _choreographed up the wazoo_. In this sense choreography is akin to a weapon of manipulation.
 
I suspect we choreographers are guilty of falling into the trap set by Abraham Maslow's famous aphorism: "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."[^mas] Temptation indeed. The cost though is that overuse of the word dilutes its preciousness, and pulls it further away from common understanding of what it means to choreograph: to create movement of the body (and most regularly to music). Mind you, I understand deeply the desire to stretch and test the limits of what it might mean to choreograph (or be choreographed); that part of what artists do is, as philosopher Alva Noë says, to bring "our organisation into view"[^noe] and thereby reorganise us.
