# body awareness and emotion

_previous note:_ [[emotion, affect and internal bodily awareness]]

This is a paragraph by Jocelyn Sze et al that summarises research on body awareness and emotion. Included here in full as it's so tight.

> The notion that bodily sensations contribute importantly to our subjective emotional experience appears in the literature in a number of forms. James (1884) famously asserted that emotions occur when the perception ofan exciting fact causes a collection of bodily changes and that “our feeling of the same changes as they occur is the emotion” (p. 189). Lakoff (1987) noted the prominence of bodily metaphors when we describe the experience of certain emotions (e.g., heat and pressure metaphors when describing anger). Consistent with these views, we (Levenson, 1999) postulated that the “subjective experience of a given emotion derives largely from the sensations that are generated by the activation of the associated response package” (p. 496). Similarly, theories of embodied cognition suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between bodily activity and the way emotional information is processed (for a review, see Niedenthal, 2007). These notions are also found in contemporary neuroscience, with Damasio (2000) postulating that one of the main roles of emotion is to bring the autonomic processes of our bodies into awareness, providing “somatic markers” that guide our choices and actions.
