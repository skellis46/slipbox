## Summary 500

**what you want to do**

### context  

"It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident” - Adorno (2001) Aesthetic Theory.



- describe what somatic practices are (body as experienced from the inside): something about body awareness and embodiment
- science and somatic practices have a somewhat troubled relationship [e.g. @ginot-2010-shusterman; @batson-2012-integrating; @hutt-2010-corrective; @williamson-2009-formative; @green-2007-american; @mehling-2020-if; @schwartz-2014-this; @wait-2023-improvised]
- historically qualitative and post-qualitative somatics research (including that which is published in JDSP) has focused on describing different practices, the presumed efficacy of such practices (particularly re health and well-being), and their utility [see @ellis-2023-somatics].
- scientific research into somatic practices such as body awareness, "movement-based embodied contemplative practices" [@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]  and other "mindful movement practices" [@mattes-2016-attentional p.258] has attempted to verify the potential benefits of such body-based practices, and potential mechanisms for change. 
- there is reliable scientific evidence that somatic practices (and other mindful movement practices) improve body awareness; also real-world activities (re interoception) like London Trading Floor [@kandasamy-2016-interoceptive]
- body awareness contributes to our subjective emotional experience [[body awareness and emotion]] -- is Transparencies affording such 'emotional experiences'? (I think it is but then I've been trained in this 'searching' when watching art)
- or use embodied intelligence as catch all? Sally: "I'm still wrestling with whether we need to be able to understand or 'label' it in some way.  I suppose this would become more important if the project moved onto to consider how this understanding might be used/translated into some kind of output, e.g., that might inform moderation."

### the challenge the project addresses 

- introduce Transparencies: a special/peculiar type of practice through performance, dialogue and simple interaction. [add quotes here from Sue]. Complex perceptual activity (primarily visual), physical action (manipulation/rearrangement of images), imagination, non-conceptual -- emotional, corporeal? To act as an accessible bridge. Somatic activity? Or intellectual? Important to tune people. But it's also more accessible than regular 'somatic practices' [see for instance @millman-2021-neurocognitive] and involves more direct action (unlike meditation or mindfulness practices). Can I make a case for it like this? 
	- "the open-endedness of what can constitute an aesthetic experience" [@brincker-2015-aesthetic p.119]
- this list of words meaning 'without a solution' is telling <https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/without_a_solution.html>
- propose to use the art work Transparencies [@davies-2018-transparencies] as a vehicle/activity to deepen understanding of the complex interactions between images, body awareness and affective responses (including non-conceptual content) while witnessing and engaging with a somatically informed art project. 
- The question of transferability – could dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities? (Sally: This seems to cut to the 'purpose' of the research, which seems to be to find out more about the whether dancers embodied intelligence/body awareness/body listening… in some way enhances what they understand in relation to these images ….  And by comparison, how this differs from 'novices'.)
- what if it's starting to unknot the complexity of the dancer responding in T? (name these things: awareness, openness, flexible mentality, non-judgemental, interoceptive ability, body awareness ... etc???)

- challenge is to understand how T works as a _practice of performance_ and thereby to trouble, qualify, complicate and challenge   
- but what of the role of somatic practices -- and specifically body awareness -- in experiencing an artistic work and practice? 
- My hunch is that this very open attitude towards abstract activities (in which the dancer is given permission and support so as not to feel judged) makes possible heightened body awareness (or listening to the body) (or could it be vice-versa?). If an attitude of “I don’t understand, I need to get this right, what if I get this wrong?” is present, then this would likely make it impossible to be sensitive to the body. The body’s capacity to sense and listen would be ‘blinded’ by doubt and perceived judgement. 
		+ fear of being wrong
		+ activity that is not goal-directed 

### aims and objectives  

- T as springboard for inquiry (remembering it was developed and presented as work of art -- for entirely different rationale)
- discover overlaps and intersections between Transparencies as an interactive dialogic practice and other photo and elicitation methods (photo elicitation, photo voice, experience sampling)
- The question of transferability – could  dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities? Sally: "This seems to cut to the 'purpose' of the research, which seems to be to find out more about the whether dancers embodied intelligence/body awareness/body listening… in some way enhances what they understand in relation to these images ….  And by comparison, how this differns from 'novices'. " 

### potential applications and benefits

- exploratory research 
- potential follow-on questions are 1) what can broader society learn from that body intelligence? Could it be used, for example, to help us to determine what harmful internet content is? Or might it help in understanding and changing the ways in which young people use and are used by image-based social media like Instagram? 2) Are there conceptualisations and understandings that emerge from working with Transparencies that motivate and facilitate the interpretation of other, more specific theories (which are then able to be tested empirically)? 
- We could focus on content moderation or equally on social media users, as the kinds of insights we discussed generating would potentially have relevance to either.

## Vision 500
articulate why this is important

## Approach 1500
how you're going to do it and what it builds on

- note Sally's idea re an initial method/period of 'finding out': "I suggest that we build into the project a kind of methods design phase, where we try out a few ways of using the Transparencies methods to help us ensure its suitability for the people with whom we want to engage."
- use a range of mixed methodologies to directly compare two groups of people: one group of experts in somatic practices; the other group with little or no experience of somatic practices. The groups will be matched for age and demographics. Use a series of qualitative self-reporting scales (e.g. MAIA-II interoceptive awareness test, five facet mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), and Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ, Shields et al., 1989)), interviews with subsequent thematic analysis
