## Summary 500

**what you want to do**

### context  

"It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident” - Adorno [-@adorno-2014-aesthetic]

_Transparencies_ (2018) is an art project by choreographer Siobhan Davies. In it Davies works with one participant (audience member?) and together they stand at a large table and place, arrange, rearrange and overlay more than 100 images printed on acetate paper. The primary physical movement is the act of moving the photographs, an interaction that is punctuated by periods of quiet reflection and occasional moments of unprompted dialogue. The images are mostly single figures caught in a moment of movement, and are drawn from visual art, dance, sports, photography, biology and science. 

_Transparencies_ is not overtly dance. Rather, it is choreographic in how it asks its participants (including Davies herself) to spatially organise and re-organise the images and to notice how these changes _feel_. It delicately draws attention to the body in two ways. 1) images themselves; 2) reflection on the 'where' of sensation

The work is also not goal-directed. Davies is not looking for particular things or for audience member-participants to have specific experiences. Davies writes that she is "not looking to find meaning in this process; a meaning can bring solidity and I am looking for movement. I stop looking at the images and instead look through them to others and recognise other ways of doing, connecting, seeing, and appreciating." In this regard, _Transparencies_ has in common ... [mention other practices]

- "the open-endedness of what can constitute an aesthetic experience" [@brincker-2015-aesthetic p.119]
- acknowledge [[the inexpressible nature of experience]]


- describe what somatic practices are (body as experienced from the inside): something about body awareness and embodiment
- science and somatic practices have a somewhat troubled relationship [e.g. @ginot-2010-shusterman; @batson-2012-integrating; @hutt-2010-corrective; @williamson-2009-formative; @green-2007-american; @mehling-2020-if; @schwartz-2014-this; @wait-2023-improvised]
- historically qualitative and post-qualitative somatics research (including that which is published in JDSP) has focused on describing different practices, the presumed efficacy of such practices (particularly re health and well-being), and their utility [see @ellis-2023-somatics].
- scientific research into somatic practices such as body awareness, "movement-based embodied contemplative practices" [@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]  and other "mindful movement practices" [@mattes-2016-attentional p.258] has attempted to verify the potential benefits of such body-based practices, and potential mechanisms for change. 
- there is reliable scientific evidence that somatic practices (and other mindful movement practices) improve body awareness; also real-world activities (re interoception) like London Trading Floor [@kandasamy-2016-interoceptive]
- body awareness contributes to our subjective emotional experience [[body awareness and emotion]] -- is Transparencies affording such 'emotional experiences'? (I think it is but then I've been trained in this 'searching' when watching art)
- or use embodied intelligence as catch all? Sally: "I'm still wrestling with whether we need to be able to understand or 'label' it in some way.  I suppose this would become more important if the project moved onto to consider how this understanding might be used/translated into some kind of output, e.g., that might inform moderation."

### the challenge the project addresses 




- is it somatic? If so, how? what kinds of instructions does Sue give to the participant? (or will give)
- Complex perceptual activity (primarily visual), physical action (manipulation/rearrangement of images), imagination, non-conceptual -- emotional, corporeal? To act as an accessible bridge. Somatic activity? Or intellectual? 
- Transparencies is levelling -- doesn't require pre-knowledge or confidence re movement. But how different from meditation then? (or, say, Feldenkrais). Can we argue that it is essentially a body-less corporeal activity?? (on the surface it is no such thing)
- but there's no such thing as 'success' when it comes to Transparencies

-  are we suggesting that Transparencies is somehow special? Or rather that it is accessible to us and makes things accessible to others? 
- what is the problem here? What if it is something akin to: "How might we understand what is happening in this practice?"
- what can we learn from (contemporary) dance in addition to how it functions as an art form? 
- propose to use the art work Transparencies [@davies-2018-transparencies] as a vehicle/activity to deepen understanding of the complex interactions between images, body awareness and affective responses (including non-conceptual content) while witnessing and engaging with a somatically informed art project. 

- what if it's starting to unknot the complexity of the dancer responding in T? (name these things: awareness, openness, flexible mentality, non-judgemental, interoceptive ability, body awareness ... etc???)
- challenge is to understand how T works as a _practice of performance_ and thereby to trouble, qualify, complicate and challenge   

- Important to tune people. But it's also more accessible than regular 'somatic practices' [see for instance @millman-2021-neurocognitive] and involves more direct action (unlike meditation or mindfulness practices). Can I make a case for it like this? 

- this list of words meaning 'without a solution' is telling <https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/without_a_solution.html>

- so much dance training seems to be about undoing the literal -- is this correct? (coping with abstraction??)

- describe the state of unknowing and openness (and of not being judged)

- The question of transferability – could dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities? (Sally: This seems to cut to the 'purpose' of the research, which seems to be to find out more about the whether dancers embodied intelligence/body awareness/body listening… in some way enhances what they understand in relation to these images ….  And by comparison, how this differs from 'novices'.)


- and yet on the surface Transparencies seems to have qualities and processes in common with established methods in other disciplines.
- hunch is that those people trained in somatic practices are able to access different kinds of experiences differently. 

- but what of the role of somatic practices -- and specifically body awareness -- in experiencing an artistic work and practice? 
- My hunch is that this very open attitude towards abstract activities (in which the dancer is given permission and support so as not to feel judged) makes possible heightened body awareness (or listening to the body) (or could it be vice-versa?). If an attitude of “I don’t understand, I need to get this right, what if I get this wrong?” is present, then this would likely make it impossible to be sensitive to the body. The body’s capacity to sense and listen would be ‘blinded’ by doubt and perceived judgement. 
		+ fear of being wrong
		+ activity that is not goal-directed 

### aims and objectives  

- T as springboard for inquiry (remembering it was developed and presented as work of art -- for entirely different rationale)
- discover overlaps and intersections between Transparencies as an interactive dialogic practice and other photo and elicitation methods (photo elicitation, photo voice, experience sampling) 
- see paper by Weiser on phototherapy: [[Weiser - PhotoTherapy Techniques in Counselling and Therapy]] -- some overlaps (in the highlights) with Transparencies.
- The question of transferability – could  dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities? Sally: "This seems to cut to the 'purpose' of the research, which seems to be to find out more about the whether dancers embodied intelligence/body awareness/body listening… in some way enhances what they understand in relation to these images ….  And by comparison, how this differs from 'novices'. " 
- partnership building 
- relationship of T to already existing photo-oriented methods
- Might a more quantitative and qualitative understanding of the things ‘we do’ in dance help generate broader understanding (and perhaps even value) for the importance of embodied understandings (whatever such an understanding is)?
- The broad role of Transparencies can be understood as motivating and facilitating the interpretation of other, more specific theories ... etc. (which perhaps is where Jane's role is?) (this from [[embodied intelligence project#^cd2a8f]])

### potential applications and benefits

- exploratory research 
- potential follow-on questions are 1) what can broader society learn from that body intelligence? Could it be used, for example, to help us to determine what harmful internet content is? Or might it help in understanding and changing the ways in which young people use and are used by image-based social media like Instagram? 2) Are there conceptualisations and understandings that emerge from working with Transparencies that motivate and facilitate the interpretation of other, more specific theories (which are then able to be tested empirically)? 
- We could focus on content moderation or equally on social media users, as the kinds of insights we discussed generating would potentially have relevance to either.

## Vision 500
articulate why this is important

## Approach 1500
how you're going to do it and what it builds on

- note Sally's idea re an initial method/period of 'finding out': "I suggest that we build into the project a kind of methods design phase, where we try out a few ways of using the Transparencies methods to help us ensure its suitability for the people with whom we want to engage."
	+ 1. qualitative analysis of embodied intelligence of experienced (somatics) practitioners versus novices (ie people not trained in somatic practices) engaged in the Transparencies activity ?; use thematic analysis to inform phase 2?
	+ 2. quantitative phase: take one or two aspects of the task (emerging from phase 1) and measure these. These measurements would act as ‘somatic markers’ or proxies of the dancers’ embodied intelligence. Perhaps this phase might involve learning/training for inexperienced participants

- use a range of mixed methodologies to directly compare two groups of people: one group of experts in somatic practices; the other group with little or no experience of somatic practices. The groups will be matched for age and demographics. Use a series of qualitative self-reporting scales (e.g. MAIA-II interoceptive awareness test, five facet mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), and Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ, Shields et al., 1989)), interviews with subsequent thematic analysis
- two parts:
	+ tune the participant to this state of not knowing/non-judgement/not looking for something
	+ transparencies
- could there be a period of training (involving experience sampling) 
- it would be worth finding out how much tuning people to not be concerned with understanding/getting it right/etc might make any difference (in both trained and untrained groups)
- what might we _judge_ as being better, or how might we judge difference? the kind of language used? their enjoyment of it? just qualitative -- how are the experiences qualitatively different?
- worth connecting with just how prevalent images are in culture -- Sally Dibb touched on this during [[embodied intelligence meeting notes]] (on Instagram for instance) -- see also early section of Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics re visual culture (plus TTV might have useful general references)
- could we engage with properties/experiences like openness, imagination ... ?
