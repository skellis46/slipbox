# reduced effort helps to distinguish more subtle sensations

_previous note:_ [[weber-fechner law]]

Josef Mattes describes how 'reduce your effort' is almost a cliche in Feldenkrais. To move with ease and comfort and to stay within a comfortable range are important because "less effort allows distinguishing more subtle sensations, and it contributes to the avoidance of negative self-evaluation during and after the lesson"[@mattes-2016-attentional p.267]
