# climbing mountains

_previous note:_ [[consciousness as a full-body phenomenon]]

I don’t know anything about mountain climbing, but I know people who climb mountains. 

The first I ever met was a man named Campbell Grierson. We were at Otago University School of Physical Education together from 1987 to 1990, and we also happened to be in the same halls of residence -- Knox College -- in the first year. We weren't close friends, but we also got on fantastically. He had a big broad smile, was genuinely curious about the world, and was an awesome athlete. We used to pass each other on a stairwell landing at Knox and, without saying a word, break into full-on wrestling mode. I don't remember it being machismo and nor do I remember anyone else ever seeing us do this. It was more like the pure pleasure of physical effort and contact. Cam was a proper wrestler and I was all bluster. I think he toyed with me really but the effort, the sweat, the laugh-out-loudness of it ... what a joy!

Cam died on Mount Aoraki on [25 January 1996](https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30702420?search%5Bi%5D%5Bsubject_text%5D=Grierson%2C+Campbell%2C+d.1996&search%5Bpath%5D=items). He was climbing with Liz Hutton and I recall that they fell down a crevasse. Cam was 27 and Liz was 23. I also seem to remember that it was Cam's brother Hugh -- a mathematician and mountaineer -- who went looking for and found their bodies. And now, writing this in the middle of January 2023 and trying to find out a bit about Hugh (thinking I might send him this writing), I learned that he died in 2001 at the age of 33, and is buried in the Wanaka cemetery at the foot of the Southern Alps. 

Two weeks ago I watched a documentary called [The Alpinist](https://www.netflix.com/title/81500204). It's about a mountaineer called Marc-André Leclerc who mostly climbs solo and often on routes he has never explored before. Leclerc died in an avalanche on 15 March 2018 while climbing with Ryan Johnson on Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska. He was 25 years old.

There's a moment in the film when Leclerc just disappears from the filmmakers. Some time later they learn that he's been all over the world climbing mountains and that when there were cameras around him it didn't seem to him that he was soloing the mountains. I got the impression that the filmmakers did not understand his pursuit of a _pure_ experience and his almost complete disinterest in status. The language Leclerc used to describe climbing alone seems to me as if his practice of sensing and being with ice, rock and gravity was akin to a deeply mindful state in which what we humans call 'self' disappears -- when the subject is silenced and there is only the mountain. It sounds hackneyed but it is when the mountain climber becomes the mountain. 

The curious thing about being self-conscious is that it can be more precisely described as the moment when we become aware that someone else is paying attention to us -- when someone else makes us feel like we have a self.[^1] For a dancer on stage it's self-evident that someone else (often more than one person) is paying attention to us. At the same time watching a dancer (or actor) who knows they are being watched is hard yakka. What to make of this paradox? 

I don't know anything about mountain climbing, but I have a hunch that Leclerc's focus on the quiet and deeply internal experience of soloing might have something in common with the state of being present while being watched by others. Clearly, the physical danger is different (!) but both demand skill, training and the capacity to deliberately concentrate on tangible things both inside and outside the body. For the mountain climber, I can imagine that the risk and reward is gravity and how the contours and topography of the mountain afford movement. For the dancer -- at least in my experience -- these tangible things are the interoceptive and proprioceptive signals that ground and concentrate the experience, and that enable us _to be_, without being a self who is being seen.

Oh, I meant to say, in [last month’s essay called](https://mailchi.mp/54cdd93b1f61/walking-and-thinking) _[walking and thinking](https://mailchi.mp/54cdd93b1f61/walking-and-thinking)_ I couldn’t track down the book that described the way in which walking changes how we think. The day after I sent the email I found it. It’s Annie Murphy Paul’s fabulous “The Extended Mind: : The Power of Thinking Outside the Brain”. Phew.
