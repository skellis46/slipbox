# I move precedes I can

_previous note:_ [[embodied movement is a tautology]]

Sheets-Johnstone writes how _synergies of meaningful movement_ evolve from infancy and are the basis of human agency -- or what Husserl calls "I cans".[in @sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.5] She underlines the idea that, according to Husserl (and Landgrebe), "the ability 'I move' precedes the ability 'I can.''"[@sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.5] She describes this idea in detail in her book _The Roots of Thinking_ (1990) but sums it up here as:

> our repertoire of ‘‘I can’s’’ is built up on the basis of developing synergies of meaningful movement, which are the foundation of our sense of agency.[@sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.5]
