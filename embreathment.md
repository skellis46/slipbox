# embreathment

_previous note:_ [[a stable sense of self is rooted in the lungs, heart and gut]]

In an experiment by Alessandro Monti (and others) at Rome University they created an illusion of embodiment based on breathing that they called embreathment. 

> During the embreathment illusion, we asked experimental participants to wear an immersive virtual reality headset, together with a special sensor that tracked their breaths and mapped them on to a virtual version of their body in real time. When the virtual body was shown breathing in sync with their real body, our participants said they felt as if the virtual body was theirs and as if they controlled its movements. Conversely, when we inverted the breathing patterns, so that the avatar inhaled as the participant exhaled, and vice versa, such feelings of bodily self-consciousness were greatly diminished. These findings suggest that respiration actually helps us feel that our body belongs to us. Furthermore, the results shed light on why meditators who focus on their breath report achieving a higher degree of self-consciousness.[@monti-2021-stable n.pag.]
