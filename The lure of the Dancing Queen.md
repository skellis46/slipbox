# The lure of the Dancing Queen

I am out for a walk during my one hour of permitted outdoor exercise. It is March 2021 and we are nearing the end of the strictest part of the UK's second national lockdown.

They are two young people, perhaps 15 years old, playing together in a park. The area is not nature as such but it is also definitely not the city. 

I am walking past them, wary of watching or intruding, but also captivated by their play. They are dancing for each other. Or rather, one of them is dancing for the other who is recording the dancing on a smartphone held in portrait mode. The camera and the dancer are close to each other; it's a close-up. They take turns: they dance, record, watch, point at the screen, and laugh.

The dancing is mostly movement in the head and neck; rolling the head side to side around the frontal axis. They more or less do the same short sequence every time, as if they are trying to perfect the performance of the moves, or perfect the recording of the performances. This trio of two young people and their camera are deep in their own world. Their game seems to be on repeat. The movement has a quality of being able to be reversed, repeated, or played back. Each dance is exquisitely brief, and not linear or forward seeking. It is as if there is a visual glitch in their matrix. I suspect they are choreographing as much as being choreographed.

By this stage I'm some way past where it is they are dancing. It has been no more than three minutes since I first saw them.

And now imagine it is 1976 and my [8 year old self](https://www.skellis.net/_assets/_1976.jpg) has to be quiet because my sister is recording a TV screening of ABBA through her portable cassette recorder's on-board microphone. Ssshhhh! Later she plays back this lowest of lo-fi recordings and grooves to _Dancing Queen_ -- and no not like [this Dancing Queen](https://youtu.be/VwRX0mcqSoQ). My sister at the time is 14 years old, and that shoebox-sized hunk of _modern_ at the time recording technology enforces my silence, if only for 3 minutes and 52 seconds. 

In both scenarios, more than 40 years apart, technology affords certain ways of being. Indeed, 'technological affordance' -- the kind that [Janet Murray has written about](https://inventingthemedium.com/four-affordances/) based on the term [first coined by James Gibson in 1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) -- is the least surprising thing I could write here really; it's what technology does. I'm reminded though of Melvin Kranzberg, the American historian, who wrote that "[Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral](https://ssrmc.wm.edu/technology-is-neither-good-nor-bad-nor-is-it-neutral-the-case-of-algorithmic-biasing/)."

These technologies -- one a smartphone used as a video recording device, the other an analogue cassette-recorder -- were designed for non-neutral reasons, and were likely used for different non-neutral reasons. In other words, how they were being used may or may not have been imagined by the designers. Both technologies shaped (and one is still shaping) human movement and behaviour. What feels different though is in 1976 the hardware was not driven by algorithm-based social networking software that effectively reached out through the recording device to shape my sister's dancing. The music did -- of course the music did -- because that is what music does. After all, who can resist the lure of the Dancing Queen?
