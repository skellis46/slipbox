# observing nature mindfully

_previous note:_ [[touching the earth]]

> For the Ngarinyin, the world is received and transmitted through direct communication with nature, understood in ritual through performing and visual arts, and consolidated into law of being and doing through the medium of dream in readily accessible altered states of consciousness. In order to experience the world through these media you must suspend your more familiar intellectual thinking in favour of sensory receptivity, awareness, and [p.24] responsiveness. Above all, you must observe nature mindfully, listen to the elements carefully and receive knowledge subjectively.[Hannah Bell, in @black-2011-land pp.23-24]
