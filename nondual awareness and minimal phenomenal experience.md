# nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience

_previous note:_ 

These are notes copied directly from the readwise highlights

## Highlights

> We have previously proposed that the impasse in today’s scientific understanding of consciousness would be helped by understanding consciousness itself or nondual awareness (NDA), a basic aspect of consciousness that is different from all other phenomenal contents and functions of consciousness and from global states of arousal (Josipovic, 2014, 2019; Josipovic and Baars, 2015).

> In particular, it has been proposed that so-called minimal phenomenal experiences (MPEs) or full absorption
>  states are examples of consciousness-as-such (Metzinger, 2019). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv36p76hva0pd4b2xv05evnm))


> Consciousness-as-such has been present as a central concern in most Asian contemplative traditions and philosophies, where a great variety of terms have been created to point to it, such as pure consciousness, pure awareness, NDA, rigpa, timeless or choiceless awareness, being-awareness-bliss, the Self, the fourth, Atman-Brahman, Buddha-nature, clear light, Shiva-Shakti, etc. (Rabjam, 2007; Radhakrishnan and Moore, 2014).

> Two main ways of seeing consciousness-as-such have emerged in these traditions. According to one, it is a state of full absorption with maximally reduced phenomenal content (Sansk. Samadhi), akin to a deep dreamless sleep, but not entirely unconscious, and without any knowable properties (Nikhilananda, 1990). According to the other, it is an awareness which is in itself empty of other phenomenal content and conceptual processes including those that reify it, yet it inherently knows itself to be aware (Rabjam, 2001). In the contemporary scientific and philosophical discourse, these two views are often conflated, sometimes under one term of MPE (Metzinger, 2019).

> In line with
>  our previous work (Josipovic, 2014, 2019), we advance the
>  perspective that consciousness-as-such is first and foremost a
>  type of awareness, that is non-conceptual, non-propositional,
>  and nondual, in other words, non-representational. This
>  awareness is a unique kind, and cannot be reduced to a level
>  of arousal
>  and phenomenal
>  content, or
>  to their mental
>  representations and representational models. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv3734c96xx778rk8br7wmte))


> What makes consciousness-as-such or NDA a unique kind
>  is that it is aware, and inherently knows itself to be aware,
>  without relying on mental representations (Josipovic, 2019).
>  The two most common fixed beliefs that make this difficult
>  to understand are that all knowing has to be mediated mental
>  representations, also known as strong representationalism, and
>  that being a unique kind necessarily implies naive essentialism
>  and substance dualism. The first belief has been argued against
>  extensively by most nondual contemplative traditions, especially
>  the Buddhist ones
>  (Rabjam, 2007; Dunne, 2015; Josipovic,
>  2019), as well as, by the phenomenologists, as this well-known
>  quote indicates: “The pre-reflective self-awareness of an experience
>  is not mediated by foreign elements such as concepts and
>  classificatory criteria, nor by any internal difference or distance.
>  It is an immediate and direct self-acquaintance which is
>  characterized by being completely and absolutely irrelational
>  (and consequently best described as a purely immanent self-
>  presence)” (Frank, as quoted in Zahavi, 1998). The second
>  belief is based on a limited interpretation that being a unique
>  kind is due only to conceptual categorization. It also conflates
>  phenomenological and ontological levels of discourse. The claim
>  that differentiating awareness and phenomenal contents creates
>  an artificial duality (Bayne et al., 2016) does not apply to
>  NDA, which, as we will see, though distinct, co-occurs with
>  phenomena nondually (Rabjam, 2001; Josipovic, 2019). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv39g1va950jp69yfg2taz6z))


> We will stay with the original
>  meaning of the term MPE, as referring to episodes of reduced
>  or minimal phenomenal content and reduced arousal. During
>  such MPE there may, or may not, be an explicitly present
>  NDA, which indicates that the term NDA refers to something
>  essentially different from such MPE. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv3746ee95h9952pwbvsamf6))


> However,
>  since NDA, as we will see, can be present with any amount
>  of phenomenal content, the term MPE does not best capture
>  what NDA actually is, a type of awareness. Furthermore, MPE
>  has at times been equated with full absorption (Sansk. Samadhi),
>  a term borrowed from contemplative traditions where it most
>  often indicates a greatly reduced level of arousal accompanied
>  by minimal or no phenomenal content (Aranya, 1984; Metzinger,
>  2020). However, there is often no clarity in the traditional
>  accounts as to whether full absorption entails the presence of
>  NDA or not and whether that awareness, if present, is self-
>  recognized or not (Srinivasan, 2020). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gv376w6njz7qdkkew4gh88aw))
