# the body and environment result in intelligent action

_previous note:_ [[embodiment]]

> But, for all that, a version of the old opposition between matter and mind persists. It persists in the way we study brain and mind, excluding as "peripheral" the roles of the rest of the body and the local environment. It persists in the tradition of modeling intelligence as the production of symbolically coded solutions to symbolically expressed puzzles. It persists in the lack of attention to the ways the body and local environment are literally built into the processing loops that result in intelligent action. And it persists in the choice of problem domains: for example, we model chess playing by programs such as Deep Thought5 when we still can't get a real robot to successfully navigate a crowded room and we still can't fully model the adaptive success of a cockroach.[@clark-1998-being n.pag]

- [[Unknown - Being There Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again]]
- my thought here is about the lack of attention. That what we are doing in the [[embodied intelligence project]] is attending to not so much _how_ these bodies contribute to (and broaden) what intelligent behavious looks like, but the complex ways in which they do. The question of _how_ we know the body is at least partly responsible for the 'intelligence' emanating from Transparencies remains forbidding.
