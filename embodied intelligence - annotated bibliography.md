## Clark et al - Mindful movement and skilled attention

Explores the relationship between motor skills and cognitive control, emphasizing the role of movement in developing and enhancing attentional skills. It suggests that practices like mindful movement (e.g., Tai Chi, Feldenkrais) can effectively improve attention and self-regulation. This is particularly relevant for conditions like ADHD, where motor control issues align with cognitive challenges. The study integrates theories from neurodevelopment, motor skill learning, and mindfulness, proposing that structured movement activities can have significant benefits for cognitive functions.

## Torrance and Schuman - The Spur of the Moment: What Jazz Improvisation Tells Cognitive Science

The article examines the nature of jazz improvisation and its implications for understanding cognitive science. It explores jazz as a model for improvisation in daily life, highlighting the role of spontaneous, in-the-moment decision-making. The study delves into the balance between pre-planned and impromptu aspects of jazz, suggesting that improvisation involves a blend of both. It argues that jazz improvisation provides insights into human cognition, emphasizing the importance of intuitive, non-deliberative mental processes in expert performance, and suggesting that improvisation is a fundamental aspect of human action and knowledge.
