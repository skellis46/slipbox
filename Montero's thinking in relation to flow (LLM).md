#  Montero's thinking in relation to flow (LLM)

_previous note:_ [[flow and nonduality]]

## LLM 'analysis' of [[Montero - Thought in Action]] vis a vis flow

Totally—Montero’s view sits right in the middle of the “flow” debate.

- **Where they align.** Both say peak performance isn’t the same as _self-conscious rumination_. In flow you drop evaluative self-talk; in Montero’s **cognition-in-action**, you drop _counterproductive_ self-focus—but you can keep **task-focused thinking** (e.g., “soften the landing,” “open the hip,” “tempo up now”).
    
- **Where they diverge.** Flow is often described as _effortless/automatic_. Montero argues elite performance is usually **effortful and guided by attention**, even when it _feels_ smooth. The appearance (or feeling) of effortlessness doesn’t mean the **absence of conscious control**.
    
- **Attention, not mindlessness.** Montero distinguishes kinds of “thinking”:
    
    - harmful: self-evaluative chatter, outcome fixation (“don’t mess up”);
        
    - helpful: cue-based, action-relevant instructions, micro-planning, quick reappraisal.  
        Flow literature sometimes bundles these together; Montero teases them apart.
        
- **Choking vs. monitoring.** “Thinking makes you choke” is too crude. It’s _the wrong kind_ of thought at the wrong moment. Expert monitoring can be **adaptive** (brief checks, rhythmic cues) without breaking immersion—compatible with flow.
    
- **Speed objection.** Even at high speed, **structured awareness** can ride along. Flow doesn’t require zero thought; Montero shows how **rapid, fine-grained attention** can coexist with the felt unity of action.
    

### Practical takeaways (for sport/dance/XR)

1. **Coach for flexible attention:** train switches between automatic execution and brief, precise conscious cues.
    
2. **Design for absorption without silence:** keep **clear goals and immediate feedback** (flow enablers) but allow **lightweight prompts** that support proprioception and timing.
    
3. **Debrief, don’t debug mid-performance:** suppress evaluative metrics during action; surface them after.
    
4. **Build cue libraries:** short, actionable phrases that performers can deploy _inside_ flow.
    
5. **Measure both:** pair flow scales with probes of **metacognitive awareness** to see how much guided attention is present when people report flow.
    

**Bottom line:** Flow and cognition-in-action aren’t enemies. Peak moments often blend **absorption + selective, skillful thinking**—not mindlessness.
