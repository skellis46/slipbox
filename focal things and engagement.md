# focal things and engagement

_previous note:_ [[focal activity is a convex lens]]

> Moreover, a focal thing, Borgmann explains, “is inseparable from its context, namely, its world, and from our commerce with the thing and its world, namely, engagement.” In other words, focal things draw us into a web practices and relations. Immediately thereafter, Borgmann adds, “The experience of a thing is always and also a bodily and social engagement with the thing’s world.” [@sacasas-2020-baking n.pag.]

- connects with [[intrinsic value definition]] and also [[autotelic]]
- relates clearly to flow (which I mention in [[speeding to go slow]] newsletter)
- but also reminded of [[authentic movement]] and not being judged (see also [[unconditional positive regard]] and [[drunk at weddings]])
- and [[the skilled practitioner is responsive]]
