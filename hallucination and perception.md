# hallucination and perception

_previous note:_ [[the self is a controlled hallucination]]

> All our experiences, whether we label them hallucinatory or not, are always and everywhere grounded in a projection of perceptual expectations onto and into our sensory environment. What we call ‘hallucination’ is what happens when perceptual priors are unusually strong, overwhelming the sensory data so that the brain’s grip on their causes in the world starts to slide. [@seth-2021-being Loc 2050]

- [[losing oneself]]
- might this mean that somatic practices are a way of attenuating perceptual priors and emphasising sensory data? See precision weighting in [[predictive processing vs controlled hallucination]]
