# phenomenology of merleau-ponty and embodiment in the world

>To engage with the world phenomenologically, he suggested, we must embrace being ‘a perpetual beginner’: coming back again and again to what we perceive before us, remaining ‘open to the adventures of experience’.

>In tech circles, ‘dwell time’ is used to refer to how long a user spends on a particular webpage – but perhaps we can reclaim the expression for time spent intentionally dwelling in a state of embodied presence without seeking to ‘get’ anything out of it.

- am reminded here of [[Kabat-Zinn - Wherever You Go, There You Are]] and his bodyscape practices ^55f871

>It’s not that we are all ‘one’, but that we inhabit a world in which, to quote the philosopher Glen Mazis, ‘things, people, creatures intertwine, interweave, yet do not lose the wonder that each is each and yet not without the others’.

- reminded here of borders and edges in [[a border is not a boundary]]

>What’s needed, at the most basic level, is an ongoing attentiveness to what’s there before us – and an ongoing vigilance regarding what we are normalising in both our online and offline environments. Fittingly, Merleau-Ponty came to the view that ‘philosophy is not a particular body of knowledge; it is the vigilance which does not let us forget the source of all knowledge’.

>Our lived bodies are here to facilitate just this kind of vigilance. The silent body is ‘the hint half guessed, the gift half understood’, to quote T S Eliot in Four Quartets (1943). We cannot grasp it or ‘own’ it or subject it to an ultimate analysis. But if we’re willing to slow down, to pause, to touch in with the pulsing, breathing lifeworld of the body throughout the day, then we can restore our presence, our aliveness, our precious connection with other beings and things no less vital for the fact that they are other to us.

The problem I have with the phenomenology from 60 or more years ago is, that by necessity it lacks access to the scientific findings since.

I therefore prefer the writings of e.g. Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela and Antonio Damasio.

Josh - thanks for the warm comments and the link to the Dreyfus lectures. I thoroughly recommend Sarah Bakewell’s book, likewise David Abram’s (The Spell Of The Sensuous, or this paper: https://philpapers.org/rec/ABRMAT). To go deep into Merleau-Ponty in relation to PhP and V&I, and the latter especially, I highly recommend Glen Mazis’s “Merleau-Ponty and the Face of the World” - I found it mesmerising…
