# art, biography, autobiography and truth

_previous note:_ [[tarkovsky and the indivisible image]]

---

In Elena Ferrante's _L'invenzione occasionale_ she describes her long-lasting curiosity for a painting created by "unknown artist". That _not knowing_ gives her license to create the artist through the work itself. She writes that the truth of biography and autobiography in a work of art is completely different from the truth of a CV or personal income:

>Nello spazio dell'opera d'arte, biografia, autobiografia hanno una verità del tutto diversa da quella che attribuiamo a un curriculum vitae, a una dichiarazione dei reddeti.[@ferrante_invenzione_2019 p.32]

English translation: <https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/07/elena-ferrante-ever-since-adolescence-i-have-liked-the-term-unknown>

>In the work of art, biography and autobiography have a truth completely different from that which we attribute to a CV or an income tax return.

_questions & thoughts:_

- is she only talking about the 'truth' regarding the creator? What of the subject of the art work? (in this case a nun)
- is she talking about the same kind of truth that Ingold is discussing in [[search for truth]]
- makes me think about the nature of truth in relation to the imagination
