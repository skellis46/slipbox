# the body in the Anthropocene (working title)

> I have talking to Richard Ralph, editor of Dance Research and who has asked me to take on editing an issue of the journal with a focus on practice research. The idea is to invite key practitioners to contribute some writing that focuses on their practice. Might you have something that could emerge from your current research in Italy (for example)?  We would be looking for something to be submitted in early January. There is no specific length requirement as we want the contributions to find their own form (images are welcomed but not required, as well as links, as appropriate). -- email from SW, 29 June 2022

_previous note:_ 




- offer to 'write about my practice'; this is what we do in practice-research. the various journals dedicated to practice-research are filled with practitioners in their bubble attempting to convince us of the value of their work. No, not convince us (that would be more palatable), rather, expect us to recognise the value of their work. 
- see [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]] of epistemic claims. 
- other examples: Freeman book (?), JAR (take random issue), CHOR (of which I'm co-editor). 
- I'm guilty. 
- perhaps more guilty given the unsurprising focus of dance practices on the body. I've even started calling them body-based practices as my curiosity has stretched away from codified dance practices (including improvisation).
- attempt to do a little dance here -- to introduce some research while attempting to reach out beyond my solipsism. That this writing is not _about_ this particular research project (called [[children of the soil - short description of film]])
- get the project out of the way: a short photo essay as part of the writing -- perhaps 6 images occupying a single page? (in a grid) -- perhaps even with some of the graphic novel texts

- the body and par ; potted history

- after brief description of ineffability (and also just how much autobiography is going on -- little could he have imagined!), Freeman says this (in introduction to book):
> In the context of practice-based research, ineffability is premised on the notion of embodiment as an existential condition: one in which the researcher's performing (doing) body is the subjective source for experience, and it is from this conceptual platform that arguments in favour of practice as research are often launched.[@freeman-2010-ineffability p.3]

"the primacy and sanctity of embodied knowledge" [@freeman-2010-ineffability p.6] (either body of the performer or the body of the work)

Draw link between phenomenologists (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) and phenomenology and practice-research:

> In the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, embodied knowledge is also concretely ‘bodily knowledge’. The _a priori_ of the body assumes the place of the a priori of intellectual knowledge, making the pre-reflective bodily intimacy with the world around us into the foundation of our thinking and acting. By virtue of our bodily constitution and our bodily situatedness in the world, we are capable of ‘getting a grip on reality’ as we observe, learn, and act, and of ‘acting in flow’ prior to any reflection and without following rules.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict pp.168-169]

- or draw link between embodiment of knowledge in the art work (Borgdorff discusses this) and the double whammy of one whose body is present. double epistemic whack.

> When we listen to music, look at images, or identify with body movements, we are brought into touch with a reality that precedes any representation in the space of the conceptual. That is the abstractness of all art, even after the long farewell to the aesthetics of early Romanticism. In a certain sense, this reality is more real, and nearer to us, than the reality we try to approach with our epistemological projects. This is the concreteness of all art, even in its most abstract forms and contents.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.171]


> The performing body bites back at the thinking mind in a prospective quintessential practice- as-research experiment. -- Kershaw, Chapter 5 of smith-2009-practiceled, p.104

- [ ] read Kershaw in Smith and Dean

- but what of the dissolution of the body in the Anthropocene. That we are not individual. 
- what might this mean for practice-research? 
- apothesis at moment is "Body Keeps the Score"
- the body is everywhere; embodiment is fashionable. (e.g. in meeting about climate emergency and role of Universities in this) - other examples

> Human bodies can no longer be seen as fortresses to defend against microbial onslaught but must be reenvisioned as nested ecosystems.[@mcfall-ngai-2017-noticing p.M65]


- holobiont in [[Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth]]
- [[McFall-Ngai - Noticing Microbial Worlds]]
- find a way to have someone (Bob?) respond to this writing as part of the submission?

- [[Le Guin - Deep in Admiration]]

> Collective behavior begins not as an internally generated algorithm but rather in the midst of encounter. “When one ant touches another with its antennae, it decides whether the other ant is a nestmate,” she explains. From tiny interactions such as these, colonies develop foraging strategies and reproductive trajectories, not as “individuals,” but as encounters in motion.[@tsing-2017-individuals p.M72] [this text is introducing Chapter 7 by Deborah M. Gordon]

- "we have never been individuals" - [[Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth#^3d3b10]]
- any use in Mary Louise Pratt's thinking about "Imperial Eyes" (p.G.173 of Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet) (it's actually a book) -- thinking about 'contact zones' but as places where the individually-focused arts practitioner meets the world (this is a total stretch)
- I really do not want anthropocene in the title. But we (humans) are always "at the centre of the narrative" (p.G173). "Its story is still all about an 'us.'"
- irony of self-authored article


> I guess I’m trying to subjectify the universe, because look where objectifying it has gotten us. To subjectify is not necessarily to co-opt, colonize, exploit. Rather, it may involve a great reach outward of the mind and imagination.
> What tools have we got to help us make that reach? - Le Guin, p.M16
