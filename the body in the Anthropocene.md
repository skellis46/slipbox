# the body in the Anthropocene (working title)

_previous note:_ 

> I have been talking to Richard Ralph, editor of Dance Research and who has asked me to take on editing an issue of the journal with a focus on practice research. The idea is to invite key practitioners to contribute some writing that focuses on their practice. Might you have something that could emerge from your current research in Italy (for example)?  We would be looking for something to be submitted in early January. There is no specific length requirement as we want the contributions to find their own form (images are welcomed but not required, as well as links, as appropriate). -- email from SW, 29 June 2022

Noting "focuses on their practice" -- just take a sample, perhaps there will be exceptions that prove the rule. But this is the unspoken practice: that when we write about artistic practice we don't write about how it is part of an ecosystem of practice. We tend to write about it as part of alternative ecosystems (ones that are not at all aware that the practice exists and nor would they care). Is fails to be in dialogue. Not surprising in a nascent form in the academy we'd choose to be in relation to authorities (philosophical, cultural). We lean on them to prop up the status of our work. This is as old (or young) as PaR -- remember conversations from PARIP in 2003.
Curious also re [[a claim to specificity clashes with a claim to singularity]] and [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]]. She writes how practices of artistic research "usually partake in both registers". Usually? 

Is it worth -- re Children of the Soil -- to do a very brief mapping of who/how it is in relation to other practices? 

> Whatever we say, we’re always talking about ourselves.
—Alison Bechdel (in Kleon's "show your working")

- see also [[to define the meaning of we]] and [[the decline of we and us]], [[I am a collaboration]]


> I guess I’m trying to subjectify the universe, because look where objectifying it has gotten us. To subjectify is not necessarily to co-opt, colonize, exploit. Rather, it may involve a great reach outward of the mind and imagination.
> What tools have we got to help us make that reach? - Le Guin, p.M16

- Le Guin's thinking here marks a very useful tension between the "I" and subjectifying that which is usually objectified. To introduce subjectification as an antidote to objectification. 


- offer to 'write about my practice'; this is what we do in practice-research. the various journals dedicated to practice-research are filled with practitioners in their bubble attempting to convince us of the value of their work. No, not convince us (that would be more palatable), rather, expect us to recognise the value of their work. Noting just how much this diverges from Strand's claim that [[I am a collaboration]] (see backlinks in that note for extended thinking on individuation/individualism)
- see [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]] of epistemic claims. 
- other examples: Freeman book (?), JAR (take random issue), CHOR (of which I'm co-editor). 
- I'm guilty. 
- perhaps more guilty given the unsurprising focus of dance practices on the body. I've even started calling them body-based practices as my curiosity has stretched away from codified dance practices (including improvisation).

- perhaps large (non-human body) images sprinkled throughout - with 'this body' on top?


I will start with a theft from the Finnish Nigerian journalist Minna Salami's simple suggestion of the value in having an image to hang an idea from [@lawson-2022-other p.151]. Use of word ecosystem (see below re Rawlence). Consider how fashionable it is? The distinction between Rawlence's thinking and Strand's is that Rawlence is discussing being aware of our place in an ecosystem, whereas Strand is talking about the hubris of attempting to control an ecosystem.

- see Rawlence's Treeline for a broad understanding of what it means to be an entity in an ecosystem and to be restored to "that inherited role"[@rawlence-2022-treeline p.215] -- [[Rawlence - The Treeline#^1445bb]] and also Strand on not being able to manage an ecosystem in [[collapse is generative]]

## self and body

> 	By grounding the self in the body, experimental psychology has taken the body as the starting point for a science of the self. One fundamental dimension of the bodily self is the sense of body ownership that refers to the special perceptual status of one’s own body, the feeling that “my body” belongs to me.[@tsakiris-2017-multisensory p.597]

## ecosystems
- what is an ecosystem? 

> A biological system composed of all the organisms found in a particular physical environment, interacting with it and with each other. Also in extended use: a complex system resembling this.(OED)

Example from 1935 (from OED):

> A. G. Tansley in _Ecology_ **16** 306 The fundamental concept appropriate to the biome considered together with all the effective inorganic factors of its environment is the _ecosystem_, which is a particular category among the physical systems that make up the universe.

- Perhaps where we choose to delineate ecosystems is just that: a choice. A way to mark our understanding, or even the limitations of our perspectives. Perhaps not so far from [[a border is not a boundary]]
- see here for comparison with biome, biosphere and ecosystem: <https://socratic.org/questions/what-is-the-relationship-between-the-biosphere-a-biome-and-an-ecosystem> -- note point about "given environment." and also biotic and abiotic aspects of an ecosystem.

> Against this background, the negotiations of sense at the interfaces of arts and academia—in Henk Borgdorff’s (2010) terms, “boundary work”—concern also the registers of sense and the questions of whether, how, and why some of them are prioritised over others. [@elo-2018-ineffable p.282]
- I include this quote here as perhaps something to consider when I discuss ecosystem edges and why we prioritise singular (in Steyerl's term) over dialogue
- also [@schindler-2020-negotiation] on boundary objects in practice-research (based on work of Star and Griesemer)

> The environmental crisis is so extensive and neither temporally nor spatially understandable to an individual that some scholars (such as Carlson, 2002; Berleant, 1995) call for a new environmental aesthetic, which would enable an appreciation of nature from a new point of view. Such a re-situating of human agency into its natural environment is being discussed in new approaches to materialism as well. New Materialism, as it developed as a theoretical field in the humanities since the late 1990s, joins several fields in their common way of re-thinking subjectivity in emphasizing the role non-human powers and processes play on various levels of life and sense-making. In this text I will explore how new aesthetic practices on the intersection of art and design develop forms of incorporating non-human agencies into the lived and sensual experience or expand the human body towards its animated, vital environment. Using concepts from phenomenology, New Material- ism, and actor–network theory, I will discuss these practices as examples for a new aesthetic, which is not so much an environmental aesthetic but already goes beyond the systemic approach associated with it. [@forster-2020-figurations p.117]

- perhaps though it's absurd (hyperobjects, and not being able to deal with that scale) -- we don't even connect with like-minded, let alone the distant. 

This body ... [lines from the film?]

what I think I'm getting at is that the 'self' in the body in practice-research is akin to the body in the ecosystem; and perhaps even that by endlessly (and rather haphazardly) using the word embodied we are trying to pull the self into that body but perhaps it sews the division further? Perhaps [[the lived body and embodiment]] is useful here: Husserl, but also other parts of that chapter.  
- am I doing anything different from what the New Materialists have been trying to do? 

The thing about an ecosystem is that it can be used quite fluidly. Gerrymandering. In writings in dance and performance, it gets used loosely and broadly: as an unspecified place human beings live in or inhabit [e.g. @moradian-2021-human; @vicente-2022-turning], as a somewhat fashionable term akin to nature or the natural [e.g. @sebianeserrano-2020-mestizo], as a entity that needs saving [e.g. @laidlaw-2021-ecological], as a thing to be aware of [e.g. @weig-2021-novel], as a metaphor [e.g. @parkinson-2010-art], as a way to understand the body [e.g. @nuding-2021-approaching], as places to encounter [e.g. @mchugh-2021-embodying]

Curious that for all the word's utility in performance writing, in practice-research we exist in bubbles: these are ecosystems of theory, with borders and boundaries constructed by authors to validate an artistic practice. 

I'm going to deploy it as a metaphor; not least because of its currency in writings about climate emergency. 

Resist writing about a work of mine even though the invitation was to "focus on my practice." I'd rather let the practice do its own work. There are too many words written about the practices of artists, especially by the artists themselves. 

### word searches 'ecosystem'

_Dance research_: just 1 article: 'Site, Adapt, Perform: A Practice-as-Research Confrontation with Climate Change' by Melanie Kloetzel (2017) - practice-research (not surprising)

_CHOR_: 7 articles (including one of my editorials)

_PR_:  82 articles in Performance Research

_JDSP_: 

- 14 articles:
- Moradian: ecosystem as something we live in (ie external to us); lip service to it really [@moradian-2021-human p.13] (also mentions exteroception -- just as a note here) -- this is common and something that Latour describes as deanimating the Earth and thereby robbing it of agency (through science objectifying the planet) -- see Kloetzel for this reference to Latour [@kloetzel-2017-site pp.121-122]
- Vicente: ecosystem as place to inhabit - "as if by changing my body I was at the same time changing the ecosystem in which it is grounded" (p.81); also equating to 'natural world' (p.84) in the sense of reducing distant between spectator and 'global ecosystem' (which is a good thing) [@vicente-2022-turning p.84]
- both these two (Moradian and Vicente) are drawing on that difficult thing of the body as subject and object (like interoception) that Leder discusses in Chapter 17 of The Interoceptive Mind ([[the lived body and embodiment]]); like we have to separate ourselves to talk about the body (ourselves) -- is this a discrete problem from, say, autoethnography?
- Laidlaw: role of humans "within the ecosystem" (human as guardian/saviour of that which we separate ourselves through language); [@laidlaw-2021-ecological p.105]
- Weig: use of word ecosystemic; metaphor of fascia in body (body first body first body first!) - "ways of shaping community, honouring human ecosystemic nestedness, and coming to appreciate Earth as co-guider in eco-somatic practices" [@weig-2021-novel p.55]; describes more-than-human ecosystemic aliveness (p.56). Focus in general in this article on ecosystemic awareness. The article is perhaps an example of trying to speak of more than human or of not separating ourselves from *the* ecosystem. Perhaps use of definite article is useful/intriguing? 
- Bettmann: article about eco-somatics; one use of word 'ecosystem' deployed as "her ecosystem" -- sense of belonging (not separate); [@bettmann-2021-public p.43]
- Kampe et al: editorial for volume on eco-consciouness (that most of above are part of). They say "embodied eco-consciousness" which in itself speaks volumes about body body body. [@kampe-2021-embodying]
- Nuding takes ecosystems into the body (microbial) -- adopts critical framing of eco-somatics (p.34). "Instead of cultivating embodied understandings of entanglement, does it not risk reinforcing concepts of nature as something ‘out there’, as an exoticized other to be appropriated for human experience?" [@nuding-2021-approaching p.34]:

> However, the reconfiguration of human/nature and nature/culture has relevance far beyond disciplines and discourse directly concerned with landscape; these binary constructions are inherent aspects of what Stein calls ‘the modern-colonial habit-of-being’, which ‘rests first and foremost on a foundational separation of humans from each other and the rest of nature (other-than-human beings)’(2019: 199).[@nuding-2021-approaching p.35]

- Kussmaul and Longley -- mention of permeability of ecosystems (at end, p.151) -- more sensitive; less like "out there" [@nuding-2021-approaching p.34] which seems more common; mention of fascia (but haven't yet looked into overlaps with Weig?); critiques inside/outside binary [@kussmaul-2021-queer p.151]
- McHugh on embodying nature: "Eco-consciousness has its foundation in an active relationship between the individual soma and the larger body of the natural world" [@mchugh-2021-embodying p.125]. Makes me think we can't avoid that me/it discrepancy. But this statement makes it about a question of scale and that's just too simplistic. And also as if we are somehow unnatural; describes (more specifically than others) ecosystems: "encounters with available ecosystems such as ocean, woods, rivers and meadows" [@mchugh-2021-embodying p.128]
- Fraleigh [@fraleigh-2021-body] uses phrase in relation to Japanese writer Yasuo and as humans being integral to ecosystems; talks about finding nature (noting from NAHR time that the concept of nature/natural no longer really exists -- everything is touched)
- Sebiane Serrano [@sebianeserrano-2020-mestizo] seems to use the term in very loose way (more like something in fashion/vogue)
- Caetano et al: more like humans and ecosystems (out there) [@caetano-2020-performing]
- Sarco-Thomas [@sarco-thomas-2014-touch p.198] refers to Chrysa Parkinson's art practice as ecosystem questionnaire. <https://nivel.teak.fi/adie/art-practice-as-eco-system-questionnaire/>. Sarco-Thomas also uses the word 'ecology' a lot but doesn't clarify why (or even what she might mean by it). Sense that this is about fashion -- of appealing to nature. Neither does Parkinson but the sense of an ecosystem (as metaphor) is more clearly implicit.

## PaR bubbles

> We cannot afford to dispense with the most basic (and moral) of research intentions: put simply, it must be for the benefit of others apart from the researchers themselves.


### looking at the latest JAR 26

- like a battle for newness; constant claims to originality; I can't unsee it now; 
- Ali Mousavi - Acoustemological Investigation: Sound Diary Tehran - 2022
	- in relation to theory: Ricoeur, Foucault, Baudelaire, etc
	- no mention of a single artist with a similar or overlapping practice
- Pavel Prokopic - Affective Atmosphere: A Non-Representational Method of Devising Film Performance and Fiction
	- "the project meaningfully applies philosophical concerns to filmmaking"
	- "key concepts of Deleuze and Guattari, and theoretical writings on atmosphere (Böhme, Griffero) and film performance (Benjamin, Del Río)"
	- no mention of another artwork or current (or dead!) artist
- Ella Raidel - Of Haunted Spaces
	- Bergson, Debord, 
	- discusses influences but no sense of engaging with other researchers working with similar themes, methods, geographies
- Geetanjali Sachdev - Petals to Light...Pedagogic Possibilities with Floor Art
	- nope, not another artist mentioned as entirely unique
- David Szanto & Geneviève Sicotte - Research-Creation about and with Food: Diffraction, Pluralism, and Knowing
	- bring the two works (by the two authors) in dialogue with each other
	- nope, nothing else though
- Katharina Swoboda - Zoological Architectures and Empty Frames
	- Butler, 
	- but what is the practice? who is it in relation to? 
	- little sense of this (but definitely better than the others)

- compare with Schwab in describing a piece of knowledge as an artefact of communication: [[experimentation is social#^da953d]]
- perhaps though Schwab's concern for how artworks are provisional ([[schwab - experimental systems#^279252]]) (ie epistemic things filled with epistemic potential) is fundamental to the expositions in JAR as being starting points or seeds. But where does that leave us? Scattering seeds everywhere (seeds dependent on theory-as-water).
- "What I’m objecting to is the use of names as talismans." [Chamberlain, in @thomson-2003-practice p.176] - referring to Kant. I think I have same objection.

## the body and par (potted history?)

> Our human body is part of space and our first reference for inside and outside; it is our first approach to frontiers. (Augé, Non-places 1995) - in [@calderon-2010-intimate p.20]
> my body is the first reference I have in the context of frontiers and limits.[@calderon-2010-intimate p.21]

- note how distinct/different these are from [[Guugu Yimithirr speaker points through himself]]

- after brief description of ineffability (and also just how much autobiography is going on -- little could he have imagined!), Freeman says this (in introduction to book):
> In the context of practice-based research, ineffability is premised on the notion of embodiment as an existential condition: one in which the researcher's performing (doing) body is the subjective source for experience, and it is from this conceptual platform that arguments in favour of practice as research are often launched.[@freeman-2010-ineffability p.3]

"the primacy and sanctity of embodied knowledge" [@freeman-2010-ineffability p.6] (either body of the performer or the body of the work)

> The body in the middle of the octagonal room refers to the artist, his/her intentions, and display. The octagonal room forces the artist at the centre to question relations between artist and public, between inside and outside, ‘in-sight’ and ‘out-sight’, self and other – and the self as other – between the visible and the invisible.[@coessens-2021-artistic p.58]

working through dictionary definitions, Frayling writes (remember he's nutting it out re art and design, much like Carole Gray): 
> for an activity to count in either sense as research the subject or object of research must exist outside the person or persons doing the searching. And the person must be able to tell someone about it.[@frayling-1993-research p.1]


> 15 October 2002: [Susan Melrose] I wonder if some of the implications might be clearer if we identified one particularly problematic area of PaR as ‘Own-Creative-Practice-as-Research’ (OCPaR). Does ANYbody out there want to talk about assessment criteria (let alone judgements of taste and value) which apply here? -- in [@thomson-2003-practice p.160]
- goes further than this when it's our own body doing our own creative practice. Kind of comical in a way. Not surprising just how much autobiographical stuff was happening in early 2000s (which Freeman mentions in intro to Blood, Sweat and Theory)

Draw link between phenomenologists (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) and phenomenology and practice-research. as I was starting (in Oz) so little was known about what would come to be known as (at the time) practice-led research. Phenomenology was massively important (Moustakas was big) as a methodological guide for making sense of experience:

> In the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, embodied knowledge is also concretely ‘bodily knowledge’. The _a priori_ of the body assumes the place of the a priori of intellectual knowledge, making the pre-reflective bodily intimacy with the world around us into the foundation of our thinking and acting. By virtue of our bodily constitution and our bodily situatedness in the world, we are capable of ‘getting a grip on reality’ as we observe, learn, and act, and of ‘acting in flow’ prior to any reflection and without following rules.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict pp.168-169]

- or draw link between embodiment of knowledge in the art work (Borgdorff discusses this as does Scrivener) and the double whammy of one whose body is present. double epistemic whack.

> When we listen to music, look at images, or identify with body movements, we are brought into touch with a reality that precedes any representation in the space of the conceptual. That is the abstractness of all art, even after the long farewell to the aesthetics of early Romanticism. In a certain sense, this reality is more real, and nearer to us, than the reality we try to approach with our epistemological projects. This is the concreteness of all art, even in its most abstract forms and contents.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.171]


> The performing body bites back at the thinking mind in a prospective quintessential practice-as-research experiment. -- Kershaw, Chapter 5 of smith-2009-practiceled, p.104



- but what of the dissolution of the body in the Anthropocene. That we are not individual. 
- what might this mean for practice-research? 
- apothesis at moment is "Body Keeps the Score"
- the body is everywhere; embodiment is fashionable. (e.g. in meeting about climate emergency and role of Universities in this) - other examples

> Human bodies can no longer be seen as fortresses to defend against microbial onslaught but must be reenvisioned as nested ecosystems.[@mcfall-ngai-2017-noticing p.M65]


- holobiont in [[Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth]]
- [[McFall-Ngai - Noticing Microbial Worlds]]
- find a way to have someone (Bob?) respond to this writing as part of the submission? 
- [[Haraway - Symbiogenesis, Sympoiesis, And Art Science Activisms]]
- [[Le Guin - Deep in Admiration]]

> Collective behavior begins not as an internally generated algorithm but rather in the midst of encounter. “When one ant touches another with its antennae, it decides whether the other ant is a nestmate,” she explains. From tiny interactions such as these, colonies develop foraging strategies and reproductive trajectories, not as “individuals,” but as encounters in motion.[@tsing-2017-individuals p.M72] [this text is introducing Chapter 7 by Deborah M. Gordon]

- "we have never been individuals" - [[Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth#^3d3b10]]; also [[I am a collaboration]] (Sophie Strand)
- any use in Mary Louise Pratt's thinking about "Imperial Eyes" (p.G173 of Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet) (it's actually a book) -- thinking about 'contact zones' but as places where the individually-focused arts practitioner meets the world (this is a total stretch)
- I really do not want anthropocene in the title. But we (humans) are always "at the centre of the narrative" (p.G173). "Its story is still all about an 'us.'" - Mary Louise Pratt, Coda, G173
- irony of self-authored article
- note also Freeman's mention of Montaigne about self-writing in [@freeman-2002-writing]

> By putting one’s own body and experience forward within a live (arts) space, the artist becomes both object and subject within the frame of the work, and, as a consequence, this situation allows the artist to interrogate and articulate that relationship.[@freeman-2002-writing p.98]

# edit bin

- attempt to do a little dance here -- to introduce some research while attempting to reach out beyond my solipsism to attempt to understand how that research might be useful to you. That this writing is not _about_ this particular research project (called [[children of the soil - short description of film]])
- get the project out of the way: a short photo essay as part of the writing -- perhaps 6 images occupying a single page? (in a grid) -- perhaps even with some of the graphic novel texts

The second is from the American artist and writer Sophie Strand who describes ecological storytelling as "held between the ripe and the rot" [@ducann-2022-my p.83] (from _As You Like It_). I think it's a useful image to imagine all practice-research as being held between the ripe and the rot. 

- might I be able to fold in interoception/soil/de-corpification/eco-anxiety? (ha ha)
