#  maybe

Dear

I have listened to quite a bit of [Alan Watts](https://alanwatts.org/) in the last years. Watts was a British-born writer and speaker who popularised Buddhist, Taoist and Hindu philosophy for Western audiences. He is a delight to listen to: thoughtful and irreverent with a cheeky laugh. 

One of my favourite stories of Watts is his telling of [the Chinese farmer](https://youtu.be/sWd6fNVZ20o). The farmer’s horse runs away. “Bad luck,” say his neighbours. “Maybe,” he replies. When the horse returns with more horses, they say, “Good luck!” “Maybe,” he says again. And so it goes – good and bad, fortune and misfortune, all dissolving into _maybe_.

Such an equivocal position is the antithesis of how we are encultured to choose certainty over uncertainty; to choose between right and wrong, between good and evil, between this or that.

That simple word _maybe_ creates space and time to imagine other possibilities and other outcomes. It acts like a pause button or a means to soften the temptation or pressure to have a position. Maybe.

Watts' parable reminded me of decision making processes in very open-ended processes in which the outcome cannot be known – like in making an art work. In such circumstances the capacity to wait to decide helps keep alive as many imagined and unimagined possibilities as is possible. This is because if I choose this over that, then the possible roads stemming from _that_ become far less available.

Such an approach is a position of uncertainty and recognises or reminds us that when we are making things we can't ever be sure and that so much of the pleasure in making things is that very same uncertainty. Maybe.
