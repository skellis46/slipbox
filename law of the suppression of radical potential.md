# law of the suppression of radical potential

> The **law of the suppression of radical potential** is an idea first described by [Brian Winston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Winston "Brian Winston") in his book, _Misunderstanding Media_. It states that when a communications technology is realized, its growth is suppressed through the constraining influence of already prevailing institutions and other mechanisms.

> His approach is in particular directed against [technological determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_determinism "Technological determinism") and instead proposes that the [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence "Emergence") of new media and new technologies is mediated and controlled by society. According to Winston, a supervening social necessity creates a need for a particular technology, but the law of the suppression of radical potential means that new technology will be integrated into the status quo as opposed to radically disrupting it.
