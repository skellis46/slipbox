# technology and truth

_previous note:_ [[device paradigm and focal things]]

Lehewych describes how [[gestell and enframing]] creates a way of being in which the world is simply resources to exploit as in [[Heidegger's standing reserve]]. He suggests that facts are likewise exploitable:

> The more human beings are influenced by the technological mindset, the more we will push technology to reveal the truth. And the more we push technology to do this, the more its ability to reveal the truth will become undermined — and in doing so, the more human epistemology will be undermined. Our very ability to understand reality is under threat, and this is a direct result of technology.[@lehewych-2021-martin n.pag.]

Lehewych suggests that Heidegger's solution to the question concerning technology -- "the evergrowing threat of technology"[@lehewych-2021-martin n.pag.] -- is _truth revealing_ art. Lehewych describes Heidegger's conceptualization of art as bringing forth (poiesis): when something passes from non-being to being; that we acquire truth through this revealing.

Curiously, the article then debates what kind of art is capable to revealing truth and that is capable of helping with the problem of technology. He suggests that any art based in ideology is not able to reveal truth. And ends up at UBI (the article really takes a dive in quality towards the end -- trying to cover too many things.)
