> Yeah, I think we've certainly been trained in our modern consumerist society ... to be to think that you know, excitement is what happiness is. Because again, remember excitement is dopamine motivation. And so it says, Oh, look at that new whatever car, shirt, house, girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever, go go get it. So, you know, I, I think this could basically be summed up, I read a quote from Sayadaw U Pandita in his book, _In This Very Life_ where he said, "we mistake excitement of the mind for happiness" and don't see the greater joy that comes from you know, peace and whatever. So I think we can actually simplify this from these terms like tranquillity or equanimity that a lot of people may not, let's just say, may not be seeking in a consumerist society. And we can really simplify this simplify this to language around contraction and expansion or feeling closed and feeling open. Because our brains are, you know, they've already set up that reward hierarchy, and my lab is actually doing studies now to confirm this, to show that there actually is a natural hierarchy that we have. So for example, when we look at the clear ones, like fear versus joy, and ask people, which one would you rather have, it's a no brainer, literally, their brain says, of course, joy. And we can look at all a bunch of different words in these two categories of closed versus open, and we find, you know, in pilot studies, we found that universally, people would rather have mental states in these open categories versus the closed category. So closed would be things like anxiety, frustration, whereas open would be like connection, or, awe, or joy or curiosity. And what we're doing now is looking to see how tightly these things couple how well they're correlated to see if there is actually a clear reward hierarchy set up in the brain. And so here, I think we can, there may actually be something already set up that says, you know, what's on the menu, joy or fear? Well, I would rather have another helping of joy, please. But if we look at this joy, and curiosity and connection, and kindness, all of these fall in the spectrum of moving in a more open toward more open mind states for, for lack of better way of putting it. We see this in our neuroimaging studies, we've had people get into flow like spontaneously drop into flow and report this when they're in the real time neurofeedback setup that we have in our in our fMRI scanner. And it's, that's when their posterior cingulate like just bottoms out, where it just gets really really deactivated. And for those that aren't familiar with flow, like this guy, Mihály Csíkszentmihályi was a psychologist who described flow back in the 70s, as selfless, effortless, timeless. So all these dualistic concepts kind of fall away as we move from a contracted state of being into a more open, open open, where we lose a sense of where we end and the rest of the world begins. And so we could suggest that that even is starting to move into non dual territory. So we're even seeing a beautiful correlation between people's subjective experience where there might be this reward hierarchy that says, you know, I, I'd rather be in flow, for lack of a better way of putting it. And that actually lines up with these brain regions that are involved in self as we start to lose a sense of that experiential sense of self, that brain region the posterior cingulate gets quieter, and we move in experientially into this territory where we lose a sense of of self and start to connect more with the rest of the world.
