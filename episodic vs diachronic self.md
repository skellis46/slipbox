# episodic vs diachronic self

_previous note:_ [[Strawson - Things That Bother Me]]

## LLM: 

- **Core idea**
	+ **Episodic:** You often don’t feel a strong psychological continuity with your past/future. The present self is primary; past “you” can feel like someone else.
	+ **Diachronic:** You naturally experience your life as a single, continuing story; strong felt continuity across time.
	+ **Memory & narrative**
	+ **Episodic:** Autobiographical memories are islands; you may resist weaving them into one life narrative.
	+ **Diachronic:** You link memories into a coherent story; you like (or need) a life narrative.

- **Motivation & planning**
	+ **Episodic:** Motivation is present-focused; long-term plans may feel abstract unless tied to current projects or values.
	+ **Diachronic:** Long-term goals feel personally binding; future self feels like “me,” so planning is intuitive.

- **Moral psychology**
	+ **Episodic:** May question desert-based responsibility anchored in distant past actions; easier to “move on” from past selves.
	+ **Diachronic:** Stronger sense of owning past deeds and commitments over time.
  
- **Aesthetics of selfhood**
	+ **Episodic:** Skeptical of the “narrative self” ideal; you can live well without crafting a life story.
	+ **Diachronic:** Narrative gives meaning, coherence, and guidance.

- **Everyday markers**
	+ **Episodic:** “I don’t really feel like the same person I was years ago.”
	+ **Diachronic:** “I’ve been the same person with evolving chapters.”

- **Neither is ‘better’**
	+ They’re temperaments, not pathologies. People can be mixed or shift with context (illness, upheaval, aging, reflection). 

**Quick self-check prompts**
	+ Do you instinctively frame major events as parts of a single story (diachronic), or as distinct episodes you don’t need to thread together (episodic)?
	+ Does your 10-years-ago self feel intimately “me” (diachronic) or more like a relative stranger (episodic)?

**Why it matters**
	+ Shapes therapy, education, and ethics (how we assign responsibility, set goals, and find meaning).
	+ Counters the assumption that everyone _should_ live narratively: flourishing doesn’t require a life story if you’re episodic.
