# the accounts of time by Parmenides and Heraclitus

_previous note:_ [[meanwhile time and parallel editing]]

Parmenides: "time is an illusion and only the _now_ is real"[@gardner-2016-serial p.162]
Heraclitus: "time is change and only change is real"[@gardner-2016-serial p.162]

> both were premised on a similar revelation: time as we experience it simply does not make logical sense, therefore it must be either an illusion or a window into the divine (that is, the Truth).4 [@gardner-2016-serial p.162]
