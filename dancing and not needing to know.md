# dancing and not needing to know

Dear 

There's something about David Byrne that makes my heart sing. I have strong memories as a teenager of dancing to Burning Down the House and being hypnotised by that opening riff to Psycho Killer (which then makes me want to say "kiss kissay" and not "qu'est-ce que c'est" -- French was not, and is not, my strong suit). 

On my website I see Byrne appears on various posts: 

Here's one on singing and dancing (including Byrne giving dance lessons): https://www.skellis.net/blog/singing-and-dancing/

And here's one on being ordinary: https://www.skellis.net/blog/on-ordinary

And a truly beautiful version of _One Fine Day_: https://www.skellis.net/blog/one-fine-day (I love watching people in choirs).

The other weekend I watched David Byrne's American Utopia. It's a concert film by Spike Lee first released in 2020. Here's the official trailer for the film:

I was watching the film while doing the dishes (as one does) and a song called I Zimbra appeared. It's not a song I was familiar with (from the album Fear of Music) but wow did it make me bust some moves. And so there I was, in my apron with dishwashing hands, in the kitchen, breaking out to I Zimbra. I don't really know why it made me want to dance so much. Maybe it was just, I dunno, rhythm. Maybe I don't need to know. But I just kept dancing and it was an ecstatic dance.

In Annie-B Parson's excellent The Choreography of Everyday Life she writes: 

> Wasn't there a dance of death in medieval times? Wasn't it an ecstatic dance? Or was it the nervous system reacting to a virus and it was called a dance? I'm not sure, but I don't want to look it up, I am tired of opening my computer to know things. The day is already too virtual to look up something as embodied and important and beautiful as a dance.

I most definitely don't need to know what it was about a song I'd never heard before that got me away from the sink and into my 56 year old bones.

Here's a version of I Zimbra performed on Colbert:
