# heterotopic discourse and the truth

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

---

In a post titled _On Triggering and the Triggered, Part 4_ British Christian blogger Alaister Roberts writes about heated debates and arguments. He notes that "the problem of offence"[@roberts_triggering_2012 n.p.] is created because of differing degrees of personal investment in a situation. The more investment, the closer that person is to the theme of the argument, and the more difficult it is for that person to establish some distance from the theme for "conventional disputation".[@roberts_triggering_2012 n.p.] Differences between parties in an argument are heightened by the "absence or decay of trust"[@roberts_triggering_2012 n.p.] which expose our vulnerabilities and produce more reactive forms of conversation.

Roberts describes two contrasting forms of discourse:

>The first mode of discourse [values] sensitivity, inclusivity, and inoffensiveness [and the] second mode of discourse [is] characterized and enabled by personal detachment from the issues under discussion, involving highly disputational and oppositional forms of rhetoric, scathing satire, and ideological combativeness. 

>Within the first form of discourse, if you take offence, you can close down the discourse in your favour; in the second form of discourse, if all you can do is to take offence, you have conceded the argument to your opponent, as offence is not meaningful currency within such discourse.

Speaking of the second heterotopic discourse, Roberts say:

>The truth is not located in the single voice, but emerges from the conversation as a whole. Within this form of heterotopic discourse, one can play devil’s advocate, have one’s tongue in one’s cheek, purposefully overstate one’s case, or attack positions that one agrees with. The point of the discourse is to expose the strengths and weaknesses of various positions through rigorous challenge, not to provide a balanced position in a single monologue.

And regarding sensitivity-driven discourses:

>Lacking a high tolerance for difference and disagreement, sensitivity-driven discourses will typically manifest a herding effect. Dissenting voices can be scapegoated or excluded and opponents will be sharply attacked. Unable to sustain true conversation, stale monologues will take its place. Constantly pressed towards conformity, indoctrination can take the place of open intellectual inquiry. Fracturing into hostile dogmatic cliques takes the place of vigorous and illuminating dialogue between contrasting perspectives. Lacking the capacity for open dialogue, such groups will exert their influence on wider society primarily by means of political agitation.

This is all very interesting (for sure) but my concern and interest is about the relationship of these two kinds of discourses -- both of which Roberts maintains are important and worth pursuing -- to the regard for truth:

>One of the most troubling consequences of the culture of offence and the reorientation of discourse around sensitivities is a loss of regard for truth. In challenging discourse, the ultimate goal is to expose the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments and interpretations, revealing truth through this process. In discourse focused on sensitivities, personal validation and the affirmation of people’s feelings and perspectives takes priority over truth.

_questions & thoughts:_

- my key thought here is about truth emerging from multiple voices (that don't take offence). That there's a kind of discourse worth pursuing here that is hard to do, requires practice, and is essential.
- am reminded of a podcast I recently listened to -- [Building resilience - understanding the human impact of work](https://play.acast.com/s/eatsleepworkrepeat/buildingresilience-understandingthehumanimpactofwork) -- in which they talk about the need for disagreement at work and the conditions to make it happen (it's about psychological safety)
