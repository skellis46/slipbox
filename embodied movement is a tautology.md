# embodied movement is a tautology

_previous note:_ [[the word embodied is a modifier]]

Sheets-Johnstone implores us to give meticulous attention to "actual movement of living creatures, to _morphologies-in-motion_"[@sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.4] rather than to behavior. She rather taunts some present-day researchers (like Gibbs 2006, and Varela and Deprax 2005) who call behavior _embodied actions_ or "in ignorance of their tautology"[p.4] _embodied movement._

Sheets-Johnstone's attention on morphologies-in-motion help us, she suggests, to recognise instances of her term "synergies of meaningful movement."[@sheets-johnstone-2010-why p.4] These are the ways in which an individual communicate with another, and that are fundamental to relationships (within and between species).
