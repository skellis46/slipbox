# losing oneself - somatics chapter

## keywords 

improvisation, non-dual awareness, consciousness, flow, 

## initial outlining 

- non dual awareness and consciousness 
	+ the hunch
	+ where did it begin? (not sure I could tell frankly) -- from interoception and self? Meditation -- yes, through Kabat-Zinn and Sam Harris (in particular SH)
- flow -- hunch that there is overlap but that they are not the same
	+ [[Montero - Thought in Action]] 
- methods: 
	+ phenomenology -- see [[Krägeloh - Phenomenological Research Fails to Capture the Experience of Nondual Awareness]]
- the line between driving and being driven -- the various names for this phenomenon
- movement as a bias
- data
	+ the practice
	+ qualitative self-reporting 
	+ conversations / reflections with KC (post practice)
	+ more interviews? 

## collected quotes

- [[Vo - Some Hypotheses on Being Possessed]] - this is fascinating and I wonder if any overlap with [[Waldenfels - Phenomenology of the Alien]]

> They argue that the accumulation function in the posterior insula might be correlated with the encoding of time intervals as suggested by Craig ([2009a,b]([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2012.01189.x#b12) #b13)). Craig’s model proposes a close interaction between interoceptive processes and time perception, suggesting that our experience of time emerges from emotional and visceral states processed in the insular cortex. It can be interpreted as a series of global emotional moments that are indexed across a finite period of present time, from the past into the anticipated future. These series produce a cinemascopic “image” of the sentient self that is continuous across a moving window of present time. [@herbert-2012-body] 
- thinking about time and flow and consciousness --

> Attention is Consciousness with an object. When the object vanishes, attention simply remains what it always is, Consciousness [@spira-2008-transparency]

- can I make an argument here about the body during improvisation as a special kind of object [[an object of special regard]]?? But it's more like consciousness keeps getting nourished by sensations of the body (like Ros Crisp used to say about filling up??)

> Our objective experience consists of thoughts and images, which we call the mind; sensations, which we call the body; and sense perceptions, which we call the world. In fact we do not experience a mind, a body or a world as such. We experience thinking, sensing and perceiving. [@spira-2008-transparency]
- just so useful as a reminder or as a kind of 'ground zero' for how to consider what is going on in the improvisation practice

> Disorders of basic self-awareness have recently come to be explored in detail by means of an
extensive, phenomenologically based interview (Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience, EASE [36]). [@fuchs-2009-embodiment]

Hetty's questions from Nov 2024:
- influence of being solo vs with other people
- what is the role of movement? (this is a key question re [[Seth and Tsakiris - Being a Beast Machine]] and the 'bias' of movement for dancers )

Zrinka wondered about the materiality of experience: density, weight; and what other access could there be? -- e.g. smell, colour)

> Comparison of the two pieces vividly demonstrates how animacy and embodiment pull in opposite directions: where the former is a movement of opening, the latter is bent on closure. For the living, animate beings we are, argues dance philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, the term ‘embodiment’ is simply not experientially apposite. We do not, she insists, experience ourselves and one another as ‘packaged’ but as moving and moved, in ongoing response – that is in correspondence – with the things around us (Sheets-Johnstone 1998: 359; Ingold 2011b: 10). [@ingold-2013-making] 

> Perception and action are so tightly coupled that they determine and define each other. Every action alters perception by changing the incoming sensory data, and every perception is the way it is in order to help guide action. There is simply no point to perception in the absence of action. We perceive the world around us in order to act effectively within it, to achieve our goals and – in the long run – to promote our prospects of survival. We don’t perceive the world as it is, we perceive it as it is useful for us to do so. [@seth-2021-being]


> fully satisfying science: Another way of putting this ambition comes from the philosophers Susan Hurley and Alva Noë, who distinguish between ‘comparative’ explanatory gaps, which have to do with explaining why different experiences have the specific phenomenological properties that they do, and the ‘absolute’ explanatory gap, which is the (hard) problem of why and how there is such a thing as phenomenology at all. We can think of the real problem as exhaustively addressing comparative explanatory gaps in order to resolve, and perhaps dissolve, the absolute explanatory gap. See Hurley & Noë (2003). [@seth-2021-being]

> From the point of view of ignorance, the ‘person’ is what we are and ‘meditation’ is something that we do from time to time. From the point of view of understanding, ‘meditation’ is what we are and the ‘person’ is something that we do from time to time. [@spira-2008-transparency]

-- and this back to frontness as a way to conceptualise the role of improvisation and 'the self'

> In spontaneous, virtuoso interaction, one simply interacts, with no bifurcation of the world into subject/object or agent/action/object. “No trace of realization remains, and this no-trace continues endlessly.” This is not a positive awareness of selflessness, or a focus on nondual awareness; it is simply the absence of any reification of self, or dualistic consciousness, and an attitude that can become a permanent expert mode of being. [@garfield-2022-losing] (Jay L. Garfield, Losing Ourselves) ^f6f3d0

> However, theoretical and neuroscientific investigations attempt to dispel confusion about the experience of nonduality by drawing distinctions between the spontaneous realization of nondual awareness in its pure form, and other experiences of nonduality that still contain mental content and are realized through reflection (Josipovic, [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR26); [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR27); [2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-021-01627-3#ref-CR28)). [@lynch-2021-role p.1641]

> Basic experiences of embodied selfhood are even more challenging to describe [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0010). There is a very low-level aspect of embodied self-experience perhaps best described as the experience of being a living organism, as opposed to owning a particular body, which seems to resist easy analysis in terms of the sort of perceptual inference responsible for exteroceptive perceptual scenes. This inchoate (and transparent, see [[62]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661318302079?via%3Dihub#bib0310)) phenomenology of being a body describes a background experience of selfhood that shades into mood and emotion at one end and into experiences of body ownership at the other. This deeply rooted aspect of experienced embodiment involves no strong component of objecthood. Crudely put, we do not experience being a body in terms of the spatial arrangement of our internal organs as objects. [@seth-2018-being]

> Based on what we know about private human minds and on what we know and can observe of human behavior, it is possible to establish a three-way link among: (1) certain external manifestations, e.g., wakefulness, background emotions, attention, specific behaviors; (2) the corresponding internal manifestations of the human being having those behaviors as reported by that human being; and (3) the internal manifestations that we, as observers, can verify in ourselves when we are in circumstances equivalent to those of the observed individual. This three-way linkage authorizes us to make reasonable inferences about human private states based on external behavior. [@damasio-2000-feeling] 

> Although this sounds complicated, we are all intimately familiar with the role of precision weighting in perception. Increasing the estimated precision of sensory signals is nothing other than ‘paying attention’. When you pay attention to something – for example, really trying to see whether a gorilla is out there in the distance – your brain is increasing the precision weighting on the corresponding sensory signals, which is equivalent to increasing their estimated reliability, or turning up their ‘gain’. Thinking about attention this way can explain why sometimes we don’t see things, even if they are in plain view, and even if we are looking right at them. [@seth-2021-being]

> Your past experiences include not only what happened in the world around you but also what happened inside your body. Was your heart beating quickly? Were you breathing heavily? Your brain asks itself in every moment, figuratively speaking, The last time I encountered a similar situation, when my body was in a similar state, what did I do next? The answer need not be a perfect match for your situation, just something close enough to give your brain an appropriate plan of action that helps you survive and even thrive. [@feldmanbarrett-2021-seven] 

> At a methodological level, the neurophenomenological strategy is to make rigorous and extensive use of first-person data about subjective experience as a heuristic to describe and quantify the large-scale neurodynamics of consciousness (Lutz 2002). The paper focuses on neurophenomenology in relation to three challenging methodological issues about incorporating first-person data into cognitive neuroscience: (i) first-person reports can be biased or inaccurate; (ii) the process of generating first-person reports about an experience can modify that experience; and (iii) there is an ‘explanatory gap’ in our understanding of how to relate first-person, phenomenological data to third-person, biobehavioural data. [@lutz-2003-neurophenomenology]

> But it's like it hurts when and I think at one point I hit the floor or like, just touched the floor and, and, you know, it's like pain receptors or your nervous system activates in order to reorient to kind of survival. And that is that really brings the whole self like, back here. Even if even if it's fleeting,

> That there is a massive discrepancy. That it feels like it feels like I'm kind of tumbling through the air. Like it's so so worldly in terms of the quantity of movement. And so the stillnesses has become super still. 

## possible literature

### Giulia Lorenzi, Felipe Morales Carbonell: Modalizing in musical performance. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mila.12515, https://doi.org/10.1111/mila.12515. 

The paper argues that when musicians perform, they constantly track “what’s possible” right now—what sounds they could make next, what moves would fit musically, and what they can physically do. Drawing on examples from jazz improvisation and classical performance, it sketches a framework for how performers learn and update these possibilities, and concludes there isn’t one single source of this know-how: perception, practice, conventions, and embodied skill all contribute. 

This is on the fringe of what I'm doing.
