# impaired metacognition and self-awareness

_previous note:_ [[paradox of loss of self while high awareness while improvising]]

Fleming is talking about a very pragmatic version of the self, "And here I'm talking about something more practical, something more functional, which is this capacity to be aware of our traits, our skills, our personalities, our behaviours, and in some sense, see ourselves like others see us. And we can study this in various ways we can look at in very simple tasks, how people realise they've made errors or how they're able to estimate their confidence in their skills, and abilities, and so on."

He describes how stress is detrimental to metacognition:

> So you have this kind of paradoxical situation where the times when you might need to be aware of how your behaviour is becoming, causing problems for others. Those are the times when metacognition and self awareness might actually be most impaired. But I have definitely, I think, become a bit more willing to accept in my own life, that those fade outs of self awareness can happen. And they do happen probably more often than I'd like to admit.

-- Stephen Fleming

I am interested in this idea of fade outs of self awareness. Even just that term is fascinating.
