# somatic practices, interoception and evidence
- 'interoception, somatics and science: this is the time'

- [[losing one's self]]

## various notes, thoughts and plans to start

**Notes from walking 20220401: **

1. claims vs mechanisms
2. interoception (location in brain) -- but multifaceted. Not just interoception located there  --  citation?
3. science / somatics
- *that* something happens versus *how* it happens
- this *how* is critical in applications of somatics to science
- that is, *which* aspect of a practice is efficacious? Or is it holistic? (that the holistic part is what is efficacious -- whole is more than sum of parts)
- vagueness vs holistic: to what extent is somatics dependent on vagueness? 
- _what's my end game? what do I want out of this article (thinking of future)?_
	+ not belief systems
	+ more of an overview? sci/somaticss -- intero? 
	+ basis of future bid

Started with doubt, scepticism. But in this writing I bring tremendous respect. Respect for those on the edges -- and perhaps all of somatics exists on those edges. 

This is some writing about interoception. But need to get there -- describe thinking behind the line I draw from the claims we make to understanding possible mechanisms for change through somatic practices. Interoception is fashionable, but could act as a striking bridge (or anchor, perhaps along with proprioception) between different epistemic worlds, different belief systems, and our relationship to the truth. 

Start with that story of being given credit at VCA for a totally different subject. My mistake as well as theirs. 

## The claims we make

- [[types of claims]] -- by Nordquist. 

> Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky-2012-skill n.pag.]

On the pages of the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices and elsewhere in dance scholarship, artists, scholars, teachers and practitioners are not shy in claiming the benefits of somatic practices. In fact, such claims are endemic to JDSP. 

And why wouldn't we be? We believe in the value and importance of these practices -- either collectively or separately. 

Any sign of negativity? Or scepticism? Or even just some limits of what is possible? 

- could start with list of efficacy just from V1.1? or perhaps a sample (taken at random from every volume?) -- like some kind of spinning wheel that returns a number and I choose that article/issue? 
- [[possible benefits of somatic practices]]
- based on going through every article in every issue in JDSP. Not exhaustive in the sense that other claims are made in other journals (e.g. dance and psychotherapy), but it's a start.

- "And institutionally, we have defined body practice through a need for efficiency, efficacy, and maximum performance."[@green-2007-american n.pag]"
- describe how rarely (if at all) are mechanisms for change described or discussed. If they are, no sense of evidence. Just because you say it, doesn't make it true.

- On what grounds are we making claims? (again, Ginot makes this clear about endegonous thinking, and how it circles in on itself - see below). However, not getting at mechanisms for change. 

> endogenous somatic discourses have a strictly performative function as techniques of the body, and their sole function is to contribute to the efficacy of somatic gesture.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.18]

> [Somatic discourses] cover the world of their tautology, ignoring what is unfamiliar to them and creating a system of reference centered on itself.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.21]

Add that Ginot describes another rhetorical device which somatics practitioners deploy. This device -- and what it reveals -- has been central to my developing this writing. This is about how somatics uses science.

- JDSP operating at wide-angle (or high?) level. Unsubstantiated claims (and unfalsifiable) 
- But even using the word (made famous by Karl Popper) likely introduces an epistemic issue for us. That those are not the epistemic grounds on which we here in somatics stand.


## Ginot, science and the validation of somatic practices

- to what extent does Ginot's criticism hold given how much work is going on in science re somatics? 

In 2010, the dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner, Isabelle Ginot wrote a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. The article is called _From Shusterman’s Somaesthetics to a Radical Epistemology of Somatics_ [@ginot-2010-shusterman] and in it Ginot asks some difficult questions of somatic practices. _adjust this paragraph to focus on epistemological critique of Ginot's._ withering critique in the role of science to validate the "highly individualized"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15] experiences of somatic practices. 

1. "the way somatics puts scientific discourse"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.13]
2. " a first-person narrative of recovery"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.13] (probably just leave this out)

> to my knowledge, no single "modern" somatic method exists that fails to make this connection between subjective experience and objective proof.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.14]

Somatics needs "to affirm its value in accordance with society's belief in the objective truth of science."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.14] I could argue that that is what I am doing here ... seeking a way of validating somatics through the value of science's capacity to reveal the mechanisms of somatic practices??? But Ginot's examples seem more like 'approval' or 'validation' from eminent people: "Science thus functions like a validating gaze cast over somatics from afar. Nevertheless, scientists willingly endorse the legitimacy of endogenous somatic methods because they are assumed to go where science does not tread."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.14] -- related to "a tenacious doxa that physical sensations must irrevocably elude language."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.13] [[physical sensations and language]]

This is simply no longer the case. But the schism still exists on the pages of JDSP? Makes me wonder how well aspects of Ginot's writing has aged. Yet when she says (quoted below) about science's function being to "foster belief" (p.15) -- amazing. Need to look in detail on what science she is describing. 

> Science has opened up to rigorous studies of mindful-movement practices and body-awareness-enhancing approaches. This is the time.[@mehling-2020-if p.257]

> ... science in somatic discourse represents a form of homogeneous, nonhistoricized, almost eternal truth. In sum, the scientific discourse used in somatic practices is not necessarily a guarantee of the scientific value of the work engaged in, and even less so of the potentially scientific attitude of its author. The function of science is neither to introduce doubt, nor to situate somatics within current scientific debates. Somatics does not depend on traditional scientific procedure that would require the description of experiments, the determination of the limits of validity of an argument, or the possible presentation of contradictory hypotheses. The function of science within somatics is to foster belief.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15] ^fd4fbc

It's as if Ginot is swiping both at somatics and science. Quite amazing.

> Somatics induces us to believe in the "scientific," universal, and "provable" nature of experience, in order to provide a stable collective context for what is fundamentally an unstable, highly individualized experience.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]
- noting here that just how many claims (and how varied they are) is I would propose evidence of how individualized it is (also lack of debate)

Regardless of whether or not Ginot's critique is accurate (and I suspect there is value for us as a field in imagining that it is), somatic practices -- on the pages of this journal and elsewhere -- is not shy about making some bad-ass claims about its efficacy. They are everywhere, and we are believers ... (following on from Ginot)

## science and somatics in dance scholarship

By 'dance scholarship' I refer to journals or texts recognised by the database _International Bibliography of Theatre & Dance with Full Text_ 

There are exceptions. In 2010, Kimberley Hutt explored the ways in which a combination of science and somatics might be beneficial in dance training, and specifically with regard to improved alignment and injury prevention. It is not clear what Hutt means by 'somatics' other than sensory or self awareness.

strange article by [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] about 'integration' (when what they are really asking for is for "somatic principles and experiences" (p.185) to get a seat at the table.
- but what kind of seat is this that isn't already present? Compare with Mehling saying "this is the time"
- noting that the Batson article includes Margaret Wilson who wrote [[six views of embodied cognition]]

> In order to further knowledge and understanding of the totality of dance process and performance, the integration of dance science and somatics, the authors advocate a both/and approach.[@batson-2012-integrating p.184]

> The overall aim is to continue to promote awareness of models of embodiment for the ‘human-being-as-dancer’ by encouraging the next generation of dance science scholars to encompass theories of lived experience alongside objective and quantitative methodologies.[@batson-2012-integrating p.184]

this article by Batson et al. is broad overview of ways in which dance science and somatics might serve each other in a 'holistic' way: "an integration of lived experience with objective methodologies, each telling its own ‘narrative’ to provide a more coherent whole."[@batson-2012-integrating pp.189-190]
- [[somatics under the umbrella of the dance sciences]] - Green 2007 (wants science and somatics to be kept separate?)
- 
- compare Batson et al with [[Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices]] -- "translation" between two world views
- get strong sense of isolation of dance scholarship. As if waiting to be able to say "we were right all along". Perhaps though I am too naive as to how the politics of knowledge production work. 

Noting writing by Schwartz [@schwartz-2014-this] who says that the function of somatics "is one of art and philosophy, not one of science. While informed by scientific knowledge and tendencies, the central questions are concerned with action and experience." [@schwartz-2014-this p.316]. And later quotes Subbotsky who says "Both art and magic imply a fusion between mind and nature. They aim at a different goal from that of science; whereas the ultimate goal of science is product, the ultimate goal of art and magic is meaning (2010: x)" [@schwartz-2014-this p.317]. But I would suggest that science's goal is understanding and knowledge. What the hell is product in this instance? 

Ginot describes the imperative for somatic practices to legitimise themselves. She writes that they do this through two main methods: 1) proof by science; 2) first-person narratives of recovery emanating from "a singular, lived experience."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.14]

> What interests me here is determining to what extent somatics' usage of contemporary scientific research is centered on the protection of an ideology, and not on the questioning of its own presuppositions. New conceptualizations of the body don't seem to inhibit somatics' belief in a natural body, or in a body that is "more natural" than another.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.24]

- Ginot describes the kind of science used in (what she calls) endogenous somatic discourse (see p.13 -- discourses of the professional world) as representing "a form of homogeneous, nonhistoricized, almost eternal truth."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

- compare Ginot with [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] and their effort to integrate science (but so oddly). As if they are increasing the system of reference centred on itself.

Batson plays a key role in bridging science and somatic worlds. In [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] the authors urge dance research to integrate phenomenological and scientific ways of understanding experience; to use an interdisciplinary approach.[@batson-2012-integrating p.190] Is JDSP the journal for that? Batson et al touch on history of connection between science and somatics, but Green[@green-2007-american] (who they cite) goes further:

> Where the dance sciences seek objective truths, somatics may not seek truth, as measurable facts, but as how one constructs the body itself from a subjective viewpoint.[@green-2007-american n.pag]

- Given Green's statement here why then do we make so many unfalsifiable claims about the efficacy of somatics? It also fails to account for more recent (??) acknowledgement of how [[interoception science overview]] helps create sense of self through bodily awareness 
- Am I suggesting here that interoception is a powerful bridge? (wary of how fashionable research into interoception is)
- re efficacy see above quote from Green and how we have "defined bodily practice"


>  Dance science tends towards a different lens – looking at the mechanics of movement, physiology and psychology as a means of optimizing our dance training and performative goals. [@batson-2012-integrating p.187]

- this statement is just incorrect. Science is seeking understanding (and is as influenced by trends and vagaries of funding as is dance scholarship). (also, note how often somatics is discussed in the field in relation to optimisation or efficiency). It's not the work of science to optimise -- that's driven by cultural demands (faster, stronger, higher). If culture wanted something else science would do its best. 

Introduce Ginot's appraisal of somatic practices' dependence on science -- such a strange relationship.



- note heavy (is that correct?) presence of Feldenkrais and Alexander in science literature. See [[ginot - epistemology of somatics#^ad8209]] -- Ginot claims because of empirical results. This is important -- sense of something observable (interoception is increasingly becoming part of that empirical world which complicates this thinking/argument)

- perhaps in [[a shift from outside authority to self-responsibility]] Williamson is implying a lack of trust in science as an 'outside authority'?

## body awareness as bridge between science and somatics

When we talk about somatic practices we are talking about awareness. The word is riddled throughout descriptions and analysis of somatics. Eddy book it is everywhere -- so much so it's not in the index. 
(Non)-judgement and discernment cannot be practiced without awareness. See [[definition of mindfulness#^ec4a6e]]
Role of attention. 
- growing body of work ... (see names for science-based stuff in [[a list of somatic practices]])

- [[definition of body awareness]] Mehling

It is a safe assumption that given the [[definition of body awareness]] such processes vary between individuals and are able to be improved with practice/training. Evidence for this? See [[Mehling - If It All Comes Down to Bodily Awareness#^f659e6]]. Mehling also discusses [[mediation analysis]] -- a statistical technique -- in which a third mediating variable influences the independent variable which then effects change in the dependent variable. Worth considering what a collection of IV and DVs might be here? e.g.  

- [[five stages of development of body awareness]]
- draw line between somatic practice and body awareness, and then interoception. 


## interoception (as pivotal in understanding body awareness)

> There is a time to say yes to the grammar of the gut.[@snowber-2016-embodied p.xiii]



![[ngram-interoception.png]]

interoception (location in brain) -- but multifaceted. Not just interoception located there (can't remember the article though -- perhaps Tsakiris book opening is useful? Or maybe I'm thinking of Leder, [@leder-2019-insights]?)

First defined by Sherrington in 1906 as ability to detect signals coming from the viscera (check this). The definition was expanded by Craig (2002) to be "the sense of the physiological condition of the body beyond the viscera"[@valenzuela-moguillansky-2017-exteroceptive p.2] Craig's definition linked interoception to afferent pathways that carry information from sensory receptors in the body's tissues to the central nervous system to help regulate homeostatic function. See also [@preester-2019-preface] for overview

Craig says interoception is distinct from the exteroceptive system -- "cutaneous mechanoreception and proprioception"[@craig-2003-interoception p.500] -- that supports bodily movement. Contrast this with Eddy from p.6??

> Recent findings [show] that all feelings from the body are represented in a phylogenetically new system in primates. This system has evolved from the afferent limb of the evolutionarily ancient, hierarchical homeostatic system that maintains the integrity of the body. These feelings represent a sense of the physiological condition of the entire body, redefining the category ‘interoception’.[@craig-2003-interoception p.500]

Afferent neurons carry information from sensory receptors in the body's tissues to the central nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is the body's mostly unconscious method that underpins homeostatic regulation. 

Interoception has different definitions. Wolf E. Mehling is a professor of Family Community Medicine at UCSF and has published widely on the science of interoception. Mehling defines interoception narrowly as "the perception of physical sensations from inside the body"[@mehling-2020-if p.255] including sensations related to organ function like heartbeat, respiration, satiety and emotion-based aspects of the autonomic nervous system. (based on Sherrington and Craig). His broad definition is any perception that begins inside the body. (this seems similar to Eddy's)

Interoception mostly consists of unconscious processes in homeostatic regulation. Yet there are aspects of interoception that human are able to be aware of. Mehling describes, neurologically, that "bodily awareness is the part of proprioception and interoception of which one can be aware."[@mehling-2020-if p.255] 

> interoception has been suggested as a key perceptual system for consciousness and self-awareness (Craig, 2002, 2003; Critchley, Wiens, Rotshtein, Ohman, & Dolan, 2004; Tajadura-Jimenez & Tsakiris, 2014).[@christensen-2018-can p.1]


- look at [@ceunen-2016-origin]
- look at [@craig-2002-how]


- include implied (ie not named) relationships between somatics and interoceptive ability -- not sure this is accurate. See Eddy's book.

- compare with use of word 'awareness'
- add note about variability in database returns; failure of EBSCO database searches (unbelievably inconsistent results)
- note that in JDSP I suspect _kinesthetic_ is used instead of interoception (loosely). e.g. in Williamson 2009 (but she also uses the term interoception!): 

> For example, traditional education teaches people to know the world through the exteroceptive system, primarily the visual and auditory. As Tom Myers notes, we learn about our world and what is ‘going on at some distance from our bodies’, and the kinaesthetic sense (what we feel in and through our body) is undervalued (Myers 1998: 102).[@williamson-2009-formative p.33]

- note how this 'distance from our bodies' sits well with:

> Projicience is a term which he used to refer to two aspects: (1) the perception of something at a distance outside of our body (exogenous).[@ceunen-2016-origin p.4]

## specialists and generalists

- [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]
- [[specialist and generalist audience in practice-research]]
- thinking about specialist and generalist audiences and being inside and outside that field. That somatics is in on itself (as Ginot says) and missing too many opportunities

## opportunities

- there are opportunities here for how we extend beyond our field. The work that needs to happen. The role understanding of dance and somatic practices might play in contributing to the science. 
- of course, somatics could just continue as is -- there's gold in them thar hills (for some at least). It could continue to propagate new names, techniques and trademarks and we could keep talking among ourselves. Their remains value for people given its current epistemic and cultural status. Perhaps a field based on belief systems in striking contrast to the status quo of science needs those conversations, needs to feel that support, needs to keep being able to reassure itself.  
- but what can't we say about somatic practices? What claims are we not able to make? At the moment it seems like anything goes. It's research's wild west.

## belief systems

- Jacobs and myth and technical core [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
- [[internalism and externalism in epistemology]]
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]] -- contrast with science
- [[the grain of prior beliefs]]
- Schein in [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]]
- [[single moral community]]
- [[wokeness and myth]]
- [[seizing and freezing]]
- do I discuss truth in the way Ingold describes it? [[search for truth]]
- [[truth and beliefs]]
- [[questioning our beliefs]] - something about what value there might be in JDSP for us to question our beliefs about the efficacy of somatics. Or perhaps, to seek precision re mechanisms. Might that kind of precision help us understand the practices differently? 
"The function of science within somatics is to foster belief"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]. true stories are stories that are believed in! [[search for truth]] but also debate on [[internalism and externalism in epistemology]] -- something about how science functions? 

> The function of science within somatics is to foster belief. Whereas somatic practice incessantly exposes differences in and the immaterial and elusive nature of sensing, scientific discourse inscribes vertiginous individual experience into a larger scheme whose uniformity promotes generalization. Somatics induces us to believe in the "scientific," universal, and "provable" nature of experience, in order to provide a stable collective context for what is fundamentally an unstable, highly individualized experience.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

Thinking more about belief:

> The field is based on the belief that we have the capacity and personal agency to direct and/or redirect our lives through gentle self-reflexive processes; these processes help us to actively participate in the world, discover more about ourselves, and make change if called to do so.[@williamson-2009-formative p.39]

It's just belief!

## naming the somatic practices
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
- [[definition of body awareness]]

When we in dance discuss somatic practices I suspect we tend to talk about them as if we know what we are referring to. But it's a long list. [[a list of somatic practices]]. Especially given how Hanna described the word 'somatics' as a way to unify (see [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]])

In volume 1 issue 1 of this journal, Sandra Eddy's brief history of somatic practices gives a taste of the breadth of the work. It's dizzying.
- [[Mullan - Somatics - Investigating the common ground of western body-mind disciplines]] -- useful overview of somatic principles and how they unite this massive number of practices/techniques/some of which are trademarked.

In late March of 2022 a colleague and I were talking about the demands of working across and beyond one's own discipline or community of practice. My colleague suggested that we need to get a feel for what is enough to understand or know about that discipline before engaging with the experts of those communities. But what is enough? (used car syndrome - Hal)

## placing myself in this field

- biases, experiences, understandings -- plain and simple

I'm an insider-outsider (don't we all refer to ourselves in this way?). I have practiced somatics -- Feldenkrais, ideokinesis, bit of SRT, authentic movement -- and continue to do so. Also because training as a dancer in the 1990s meant being exposed to a smattering of somatics-informed principles, methods and approaches. Where I studied it was called _Applied Kinesiology_ -- given credit (mix-up across science and arts). Outsider because my world view, livelihood and identity are not dependent on the transmission and efficacy of somatic practices. Do I think the world would be a better place if we were more somatically informed? Yes. Note what my bio says.
