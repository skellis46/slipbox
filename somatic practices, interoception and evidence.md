# somatic practices, interoception and evidence
- 'interoception, somatics and science'

> endogenous somatic discourses have a strictly performative function as techniques of the body, and their sole function is to contribute to the efficacy of somatic gesture.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.18]

> [Somatic discourses] cover the world of their tautology, ignoring what is unfamiliar to them and creating a system of reference centered on itself.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.21]

- to what extent does Ginot's criticism hold given how much work is going on in science re somatics? 

In late March of 2022 a colleague and I were talking about the demands of working across and beyond one's own discipline or community of practice. My colleague suggested that we need to get a feel for what is enough to understand or know about that discipline before engaging with the experts of those communities. But what is enough? (used car syndrome - Hal)

When we talk about somatic practices we are talking about awareness. The word is riddled throughout descriptions and analysis of somatics. Eddy book it is everywhere -- so much so it's not in the index. 
(Non)-judgement and discernment cannot be practiced without awareness. 
Role of attention. 

**Notes from walking 20220401: **

1. claims vs mechanisms
2. interoception (location in brain) -- but multifaceted. Not just interoception (can't remember the article though -- one of recent onces)
3. science / somatics
- *that* something happens versus *how* it happens
- this *how* is critical in applications of somatics to science
- that is, *which* aspect of a practice is efficacious? Or is it holistic? (that the holistic part is what is efficacious -- whole is more than sum of parts)
- vagueness vs holistic
- _what's my end game? what do I want out of this article (thinking of future)?_
	+ not belief systems
	+ more of an overview? sci/soms -- intero? 
- start with nomenclature of interoception
- start with newsletter as a way to get into it? 


## interoception (as exemplar of what?)

- include implied (ie not named) relationships between somatics and interoceptive ability -- not sure this is accurate. See Eddy's book. 
- [[interoception]]

### interoception in JDSP

- search JDSP database (3 March 2022): 
	- _interoception_ returns: [@weig-2021-novel], [@moradian-2021-human], [@kussmaul-2021-queer] (only in reference); but also mentioned in [@williamson-2009-formative p.32]
	- _interoceptive_ returns: [@batson-2017-how], [@cohen-2010-sightless], [@eddy-2009-briefa], [@rufo-2020-re], [@davidson-2016-ontological], [@choiniere-2013-methodologya], [@mchugh-2021-embodying]; also [@williamson-2009-formative] (not mentioned in database search)
	- _proprioception_ returns: [@rufo-2020-re], [@delima-2013-transmeaninga], [@silveira-2020-somatic], [@mcleod-2020-dance], [@sweeney-2013-topophilia], [@davidson-2016-ontological], [@choiniere-2013-methodologya], [@weig-2021-novel]
	- _exteroception_ returns: [@davidson-2016-ontological], [@choiniere-2013-methodologya], [@moradian-2021-human]
	- _exteroceptive_ returns: [@mchugh-2021-embodying], [@davidson-2016-ontological], [@rufo-2020-re], [@choiniere-2018-somatica]; note that that Williamson uses the work (see quote below) -- so difficult to trust the search function
- compare with use of word 'awareness'
- add note about variability in database returns; failure of EBSCO database searches (unbelievably inconsistent results)
- note that in JDSP I suspect _kinesthetic_ is used instead of interoception (loosely). e.g. in Williamson 2009 (but she also uses the term interoception!): 

> For example, traditional education teaches people to know the world through the exteroceptive system, primarily the visual and auditory. As Tom Myers notes, we learn about our world and what is ‘going on at some distance from our bodies’, and the kinaesthetic sense (what we feel in and through our body) is undervalued (Myers 1998: 102).[@williamson-2009-formative p.33]

- note how this 'distance from our bodies' sits well with:

> Projicience is a term which he used to refer to two aspects: (1) the perception of something at a distance outside of our body (exogenous).[@ceunen-2016-origin p.4]

## the claims we make

- could start with list of efficacy just from V1.1? 
- [[possible benefits of somatic practices]]
- based on going through every article in every issue in JDSP. Not exhaustive in the sense that other claims are made in other journals (e.g. dance and psychotherapy), but it's a start.
- useful summary at beginning of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] -- describes pedagogic, better (more virtuosic) dancing, injury prevention and rehab
- "sometimes overzealous and too narrowly optimistic stances towards somatics" (written as a counter to this)[@fortin-2017-looking p.146]
- "And institutionally, we have defined body practice through a need for efficiency, efficacy, and maximum performance."[@green-2007-american n.pag]"
- describe how rarely (if at all) are mechanisms for change described or discussed. If they are, no sense of evidence. Just because you say it, doesn't make it true: 
 
> Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky-2012-skill n.pag.]

- mechanisms for change. On what grounds are we making claims? 


## belief systems

- Jacobs and myth and technical core [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
- [[internalism and externalism in epistemology]]
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]] -- contrast with science
- [[the grain of prior beliefs]]
- Schein in [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]]
- [[single moral community]]
- [[wokeness and myth]]
- [[seizing and freezing]]
- do I discuss truth in the way Ingold describes it? [[search for truth]]
- [[truth and beliefs]]
- [[questioning our beliefs]] - something about what value there might be in JDSP for us to question our beliefs about the efficacy of somatics. Or perhaps, to seek precision re mechanisms. Might that kind of precision help us understand the practices differently? 
"The function of science within somatics is to foster belief"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]. true stories are stories that are believed in! [[search for truth]] but also debate on [[internalism and externalism in epistemology]] -- something about how science functions? 

> The function of science within somatics is to foster belief. Whereas somatic practice incessantly exposes differences in and the immaterial and elusive nature of sensing, scientific discourse inscribes vertiginous individual experience into a larger scheme whose uniformity promotes generalization. Somatics induces us to believe in the "scientific," universal, and "provable" nature of experience, in order to provide a stable collective context for what is fundamentally an unstable, highly individualized experience.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

Thinking more about belief:

> The field is based on the belief that we have the capacity and personal agency to direct and/or redirect our lives through gentle self-reflexive processes; these processes help us to actively participate in the world, discover more about ourselves, and make change if called to do so.[@williamson-2009-formative p.39]

It's just belief!


## specialists and generalists

- [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]
- [[specialist and generalist audience in practice-research]]
- thinking about specialist and generalist audiences and being inside and outside that field. That somatics is in on itself and missing too many opportunities




## schism between science and somatic practices -- the question of legitimation

Ginot describes the imperative for somatic practices to legitimise themselves. She writes that they do this through two main methods: 1) proof by science; 2) first-person narratives of recovery emanating from "a singular, lived experience."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.14]

> What interests me here is determining to what extent somatics' usage of contemporary scientific research is centered on the protection of an ideology, and not on the questioning of its own presuppositions. New conceptualizations of the body don't seem to inhibit somatics' belief in a natural body, or in a body that is "more natural" than another.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.24]

- Ginot describes the kind of science used in (what she calls) endogenous somatic discourse (see p.13 -- discourses of the professional world) as representing "a form of homogeneous, nonhistoricized, almost eternal truth."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

- compare Ginot with [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] and their effort to integrate science (but so oddly). As if they are increasing the system of reference centred on itself.

Batson plays a key role in bridging science and somatic worlds. In [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] they urge dance research to integrate phenomenological and scientific ways of understanding experience; to use an interdiscipinary approach[@batson-2012-integrating p.190] Is JDSP the journal for that? Batson et al touch on history of connection between science and somatics, but Green[@green-2007-american] (who they cite) goes further:

> Where the dance sciences seek objective truths, somatics may not seek truth, as measurable facts, but as how one constructs the body itself from a subjective viewpoint.[@green-2007-american n.pag]

- Given Green's statement here why then do we make so many unfalsifiable claims about the efficacy of somatics? It also fails to account for more recent (??) acknowledgement of how [[interoception]] helps create sense of self. 
- Am I suggesting here that interoception is a powerful bridge? (wary of how fashionable research into interoception is)
- re efficacy see above quote from Green and how we have "defined bodily practice"

Introduce Ginot's appraisal of somatic practices dependence on science -- such a strange relationship.

>  In sum, the scientific discourse used in somatic practices is not necessarily a guarantee of the scientific value of the work engaged in, and even less so of the potentially scientific attitude of its author. The function of science is neither to introduce doubt, nor to situate somatics within current scientific debates. Somatics does not depend on traditional scientific procedure that would require the description of experiments, the determination of the limits of validity of an argument, or the possible presentation of contradictory hypotheses. The function of science within somatics is to foster belief.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

- note heavy (is that correct?) presence of Feldenkrais and Alexander in science literature. See [[ginot - epistemology of somatics#^ad8209]] -- Ginot claims because of empirical results. This is important -- sense of something observable (interoception is increasingly becoming part of that empirical world)

- perhaps in [[a shift from outside authority to self-responsibility]] Williamson is implying a lack of trust in science as an 'outside authority'?

## reaching out into science

- [[Hutt - Corrective alignment and injury prevention]]
- [[somatics under the umbrella of the dance sciences]] - Green 2007 (wants science and somatics to be kept separate?)
- strange article by [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] about 'integration' (when what they are really asking for is for "somatic principles and experiences" (p.185) to get a seat at the table.
- but what kind of seat is this that isn't already present? 
- nothing that the Batson article includes Margaret Wilson who wrote [[six views of embodied cognition]] -- correct?
- compare Batson et al with [[Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices]] -- "translation" between two world views



# edit bin

## naming the somatic practices
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
- [[definition of body awareness]]

When we in dance discuss somatic practices I suspect we tend to talk about them as if we know what we are referring to. But it's a long list. [[a list of somatic practices]]. Especially given how Hanna described the word 'somatics' as a way to unify (see [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]])

In volume 1 issue 1 of this journal, Sandra Eddy's brief history of somatic practices gives a taste of the breadth of the work. It's dizzying.
- [[Mullan - Somatics - Investigating the common ground of western body-mind disciplines]] -- useful overview of somatic principles and how they unite this massive number of practices/techniques/some of which are trademarked.

## placing myself in this field

- biases, experiences, understandings -- plain and simple

I'm an insider-outsider (don't we all refer to ourselves in this way?). I have practiced somatics -- Feldenkrais, ideokinesis, bit of SRT, authentic movement -- and continue to do so. Also because training as a dancer in the 1990s meant being exposed to a smattering of somatics-informed principles, methods and approaches. Where I studied it was called _Applied Kinesiology_ -- given credit (mix-up across science and arts). Outsider because my world view, livelihood and identity are not dependent on the transmission and efficacy of somatic practices. Do I think the world would be a better place if we were more somatically informed? Yes. Note what my bio says.
