# somatic practices, interoception and evidence

> endogenous somatic discourses have a strictly performative function as techniques of the body, and their sole function is to contribute to the efficacy of somatic gesture.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.18]

> [Somatic discourses] cover the world of their tautology, ignoring what is unfamiliar to them and creating a system of reference centered on itself.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.21]


- could start with list of efficacy just from V1.1? 

## naming the somatic practices

When we in dance discuss somatic practices I suspect we tend to talk about them as if we know what we are referring to. But it's a long list. [[a list of somatic practices]]. Especially given how Hanna described the word 'somatics' as a way to unify (see [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]])

In volume 1 issue 1 of this journal, Sandra Eddy's brief history of somatic practices gives a taste of the breadth of the work. It's dizzying.
- [[Mullan - Somatics - Investigating the common ground of western body-mind disciplines]] -- useful overview of somatic principles and how they unite this massive number of practices/techniques/some of which are trademarked.

## the claims we make

- [[possible benefits of somatic practices]]
- based on going through every article in every issue in JDSP. Not exhaustive in the sense that other claims are made in other journals (e.g. dance and psychotherapy), but it's a start.
- useful summary at beginning of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] -- describes pedagogic, better (more virtuosic) dancing, injury prevention and rehab
- "sometimes overzealous and too narrowly optimistic stances towards somatics" (written as a counter to this)[@fortin-2017-looking p.146]

## placing myself in this field

- biases, experiences, understandings -- plain and simple

I'm an insider-outsider (don't we all refer to ourselves in this way?). I have practiced somatics -- Feldenkrais, ideokinesis, bit of SRT, authentic movement -- and continue to do so. Also because training as a dancer in the 1990s meant being exposed to a smattering of somatics-informed principles, methods and approaches. Where I studied it was called _Applied Kinesiology_ -- given credit (mix-up across science and arts). Outsider because my world view, livelihood and identity are not dependent on the transmission and efficacy of somatic practices. Do I think the world would be a better place if we were more somatically informed? Yes. Note what my bio says.

## schism between science and somatic practices -- the question of legitimation

Ginot describes the imperative for somatic practices to legitimise themselves. She writes that they do this through two main methods: 1) proof by science; 2) first-person narratives of recovery emanating from "a singular, lived experience."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.14]

> What interests me here is determining to what extent somatics' usage of contemporary scientific research is centered on the protection of an ideology, and not on the questioning of its own presuppositions. New conceptualizations of the body don't seem to inhibit somatics' belief in a natural body, or in a body that is "more natural" than another.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.24]

- Ginot describes the kind of science used in (what she calls) endogenous somatic discourse (see p.13 -- discourses of the professional world) as representing "a form of homogeneous, nonhistoricized, almost eternal truth."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

- compare with [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] and their effort to integrate science (but so oddly). As if they are increasing the system of reference centred on itself.

Batson plays a key role in bridging science and somatic worlds. 

Introduce Ginot's appraisal of somatic practices dependence on science -- such a strange relationship.

>  In sum, the scientific discourse used in somatic practices is not necessarily a guarantee of the scientific value of the work engaged in, and even less so of the potentially scientific attitude of its author. The function of science is neither to introduce doubt, nor to situate somatics within current scientific debates. Somatics does not depend on traditional scientific procedure that would require the description of experiments, the determination of the limits of validity of an argument, or the possible presentation of contradictory hypotheses. The function of science within somatics is to foster belief.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]

"The function of science within somatics is to foster belief"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]. true stories are stories that are believed in. [[search for truth]] but also debate on [[internalism and externalism in epistemology]] -- something about how science functions? 

> The function of science within somatics is to foster belief. Whereas somatic practice incessantly exposes differences in and the immaterial and elusive nature of sensing, scientific discourse inscribes vertiginous individual experience into a larger scheme whose uniformity promotes generalization. Somatics induces us to believe in the "scientific," universal, and "provable" nature of experience, in order to provide a stable collective context for what is fundamentally an unstable, highly individualized experience.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15]



- strange article by [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]] about 'integration' (when what they are really asking for is for "somatic principles and experiences" (p.185) to get a seat at the table.
- but what kind of seat is this that isn't already present? 
- nothing that the Batson article includes Margaret Wilson who wrote [[six views of embodied cognition]] -- correct?
- compare Batson et al with [[Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices]] -- "translation" between two world views

- [[interoception]]

- review article?
- why Feldenkrais? 
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
- [[definition of body awareness]]
- mechanisms for change. On what grounds are we making claims? 
- [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]
- [[dance and embodiment (working title)]]

- note heavy (is that correct?) presence of Feldenkrais and Alexander in science literature. See [[ginot - epistemology of somatics#^ad8209]] -- Ginot claims because of empirical results. This is important -- sense of something observable (interoception is increasingly becoming part of that empirical world)
