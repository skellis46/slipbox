My experience and work: embodied practices in nature (with focus on felt sense, somatic sensitivity and non-dual awareness)

Looking to develop a multi-disciplinary project and funding bid with following aspects: 

- focus on embodied practices in nature
- collective sense or consciousness, social connection and interoception
- trans-species sensitivity
- body-focused first person subjective experiential methods, combined with third person data gathering 


Subject: Potential collaboration on embodied nature practices and collective sense

Dear ,

I am getting in touch to explore whether you might be interested in an initial conversation re collaborating on a new multi-disciplinary research project and associated funding bid focused on embodied practices in nature. My own work is grounded in embodied and somatic practices in natural environments, with particular emphasis on felt sense, somatic sensitivity and non-dual awareness.

The project I am developing would bring together body-focused first person experiential methods with more conventional third person data gathering. I am especially interested in working through collective consciousness (perhaps "social connection"?), trans-species orientations, social interoception and embodiment might be part of a complex confluence of ideas and practices to understand, evidence and sustain through time.

I am looking for co-investigators and collaborators from different disciplines who might see their own interests aligning with these concerns and who would be interested to shaping the bid and research design together. 

What do you think? I'd be happy to meet online for a short conversation if that might be useful. 

Best wishes

Simon Ellis

Contemporary responses to ecological crisis remain disembodied and data-driven, treating nature as a tool for wellbeing or behaviour change while sidelining lived, collective and more-than-human ways of knowing. This project addresses the lack of rigorous transdisciplinary methods for recognising, working with and evidencing those embodied human–nature relationships in research, governance and everyday life.

While large-scale psychological studies have demonstrated the importance of nature connectedness for wellbeing and behaviour, they work with simplified, individualised constructs and rely on self-report metrics. This project asks what is obscured when experience is flattened into such data, and develops alternative modes of inquiry grounded in embodied and collective practice.

- what benefits might this have to C-DaRE? to CC? to CU? 
- how does this sit with-in the Centre/Uni's plan and roadmap?
- why would the AHRC invest in this research? 
- who do we need on the team to ensure strong multi-disciplinary approach? 
- QR funds to cover a couple of days on it? 
- scale? 

Alignment re 2030 research strategy:
- Aligns with the Creative Cultures and Sustainability, Equity and Resilience themes by using arts and humanities methods to address contemporary socio-ecological challenges and more-than-human relations as critical real-world issues. 
- Contributes to the Research and Impact theme by delivering challenge-led, transdisciplinary research on eco-distress, nature connectedness and collective sense that is designed for significant societal and environmental impact. 
- Strengthens CU’s research environment and strategic partnerships by building high performing teams around embodied, participatory practice, co-creating knowledge with communities and positioning Coventry as an international leader in innovative, impact-driven creative research. 

## brief summary

- Problems: people feel less connected to the more-than-human world; embodied and place-based knowledge is ignored in decisions; there are few solid ways to combine arts, somatics, ecology and social science.
    
- Questions: how “collective sense” and trans-species participation work in practice; how they can be understood, evidenced and used to support long-term relationships with nature, not just short-term wellbeing or behaviour change.
    
- Strategy: multi-site, arts-led and somatic fieldwork co-designed with communities and ecological partners, creating sharable maps, descriptions and prototypes that can sit alongside numbers and indicators in planning, health and environmental governance.
    
- Internal fit (Coventry): directly supports challenge-led, transdisciplinary and impact-focused research; links to Creative Cultures, Health and Wellbeing and Sustainability, Equity and Resilience; builds high-performing teams, strategic partnerships and knowledge exchange.
    
- External fit (AHRC and UKRI): matches AHRC focus on arts and humanities leadership in place, environment and health; aligns with UKRI priorities on building a green future, better health and wellbeing, and fairer opportunities by addressing eco-distress, unequal access to nature and place-based responses to climate and biodiversity crises.


## problems

### problem 1:

Disconnection from nature undermines mental health and sustains a gap between abstract environmental concern and meaningful action, because most interventions treat nature as a tool for wellbeing or behaviour change rather than a field of kinship and shared sensing.

Project response  
The project investigates how embodied, transactional experiences and trans-species forms of “collective sense” can re-pattern long-term human–nature relationships beyond short-term wellbeing effects and instrumental framings.

### problem 2: 

Environmental planning and governance are dominated by quantitative indicators that sideline lived, embodied and place-based knowledges, leaving them with little evidential status in design and policy.
    
Project response  
The project develops and tests arts-based and somatic methods for collective, more-than-human sensing that can generate sharable descriptions and mappings, allowing these forms of experience to sit alongside quantitative data in decision-making.

### problem 3:
Despite funder and policy demands for transdisciplinary work on health, sustainability and equity, there are few robust toolkits or exemplars that integrate arts, somatics, ecological science and social science around more-than-human participation.

Project response
The project builds and trials a multi-site methodological toolkit that shows how somatic and practice-research approaches can produce rigorous, transferable knowledge about human–nature relations and supports the development of researchers able to work in this way.

## some questions (addressed)

1. What is the RQ?

How do situated practices of moving with and attending to specific environments generate _collective sense_ across human and more-than-human participants, and how can these experiential transactions be documented and analysed without reducing them to purely data-driven models of perception and consciousness?

2. what counts as data in this research?
List possible forms (movement documentation, audio, drawings, interview transcripts, collective scores, etc.) and how each will actually be analysed.

Relational events and traces: co-created movement practices, scores and tasks, micro-phenomenological interviews, sensory and affective fieldnotes, audio–video registrations of sessions, simple environmental measures, plus critically read outputs from existing nature-connectedness metrics. Data are the transactions and patterns across these, not just any one dataset.

3. What is 'collective sense'? 
could be: 
- converging reports of similar sensations?
- coordinated action without explicit negotiation?
- something like field or group consciousness?
I think it is the latter -- but what is that? 

A working definition: an emergent, shared field of attention and feeling in which human and non-human lives co-constitute each other’s perception and response. It is not the sum of individual experiences but an ongoing, more-than-individual sensibility that arises through repeated, situated interaction.

3. Are non-humans co-participants? 
Am I comfortable saying more-than-humans are co-participants in the research? If so, what are the consequences methodologically and ethically?

Conceptually yes – they are treated as agents that shape the encounters, affordances and tempos of the work, not as backdrop or “stimuli.” In governance terms only humans are formal research participants, but methods, protocols and interpretations explicitly recognise non-humans as co-constitutive partners in the collective sense that emerges.

4. What do we give back to the world at the end of it? 
Beyond articles and a monograph, what are the practice-based and policy-relevant outputs that a panel member can picture:
- A “kinship practices” toolkit for nature-based practitioners?
- New documentation methods for multi-species, spiritual, embodied heritage?
- Contributions to guidance on nature-based interventions?

To people and places: locally usable practices and toolkits for nature-based collective sensing, co-authored materials with partners, and clear language for resisting reductive datafication in policy and wellbeing agendas. To sites and ecologies: concrete stewardship actions agreed with partners, and protocols that do not just extract experience but deepen ongoing care for those environments.

4. Why standard and not curiosity? What demands this level of resource? 
What about this genuinely demands that scale of resource (size of team, multi-site work, long duration, cross-centre collaborations, non-academic partners)?

The project needs multi-year, multi-site, practice-led work with communities and landscapes, cross-disciplinary collaboration (arts, eco-psychology, environmental humanities), serious time for embodied fieldwork, and at least one PDRA to hold the methodological spine and data stewardship. A Standard Grant is justified by the scale of engagement, the depth of documentation and analysis required, and the expectation to deliver field-shaping concepts, methods and impact rather than a small experimental pilot.

## rough overview
How collective sense emerges in long-term, nature-based embodied practices across human and more-than-human relations.

- Dewey’s “experience as transaction” is the philosophical frame for why you refuse to reduce this to psychometric data.
- [[trans-species consciousness]] / more-than-human co-constitution is the ontological claim (humans are not the only “knowers” in the system).
- Kinship Workshop participants are the empirical site and co-researchers.

## differentiating from NCRG
Miles Richardson’s Nature Connectedness Research Group is established: large-scale surveys, psychometric indices, policy influence (UN, UK government), and “nature connectedness” as a psychological construct with clear wellbeing and pro-environmental behaviour links:
- Scales, indices, correlational work on nature connectedness and wellbeing/pro-environmental behaviour.
- A narrative that is still basically individual, cognitive-affective, and survey-friendly.

How to differentiate (while playing to our strengths):
- we are after collective, embodied, situated experience – not “how connected do you feel on a Likert scale”, but how connection is co-constituted in practice between humans, landscape, weather, plants, animals, spirits, etc.
- we are explicitly interested in the spiritual and more-than-human dimensions as felt and practiced, not just as variables in a regression model.

strategic to treat Derby as dominant paradigm:

While large-scale psychological studies have demonstrated the importance of nature connectedness for wellbeing and behaviour, they work with simplified, individualised constructs and rely on self-report metrics. This project asks what is obscured when experience is flattened into such data, and develops alternative modes of inquiry grounded in embodied and collective practice.

## leverage C-DaRE's expertise in 3 ways:
- practice research 
- could more than human kinship fit within cultural heritage paradigm? 
- critique of quantification and “experience as data” could connect to postdigital debates on platformisation, metrics, and AI in environmental governance (that is a stretch)

## [alignment with AHRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/remit-programmes-and-priorities/our-research-portfolio-and-priorities): 
- discovering ourselves: link to “collective sense”, trans-species consciousness and spiritual dimensions: we are re-describing what “self” and “experience” mean in a damaged planetary context.
- contemporary challenges / green future: we need a **hard claim** that modes of collective, more-than-human sensing cultivated in these practices are not just “interesting” but material to climate adaptation, biodiversity care, community resilience etc.
- cultural assets: position Kinship Workshop practices as cultural heritage of relational, nature-based embodiment, generating new forms of documentation and transmission (scores, films, toolkits, etc.).
- creative economy: Impacts on nature-based cultural practices, outdoor arts, health and community organisations, not just dance.

## clear critical stance re data. 
- We are not “anti-data”, we are against impoverished forms of data that detach experience from the relational fields that generate it.
- We treat embodied, narrative, somatic, poetic and spiritual articulations as legitimate data within a Deweyan “transactional” frame.
- We will experiment with ways to ‘thicken’ data: multimodal notations, co-created scores, micro-phenomenology, collective diaries, maybe very light numerical traces (e.g. seasons, durations, place recurrences) that show pattern without collapsing everything into metrics.
- BUT, need to address question of what our evidence is

## design 
- Longitudinal, seasonal structure
	+ Commit to at least two full years of seasonal cycles, with a clear pattern (e.g. 3–4 intensive gatherings per year + ongoing low-level practices).
	+ Ask: what specifically can only be seen over seasons? E.g. changing relations to particular trees, paths, animals, weathers; shifts in collective tacit knowledge.
- Collective and trans-species “sense” as method (not topic)
	+ Use scores and tasks that require attending to more-than-human signals (wind, soil, birds, water flows, etc.) and then collectively articulating how decisions were made in response.
	+ Treat the difficulty of describing collective spiritual experiences as a research object: you’re not just documenting, you are experimenting with forms of saying the unsayable (poetic writing, voice, drawing, movement, sound, etc.).
- Spiritual language and AHRC sensibilities
	+ Frame spirituality as a dimension of lived, embodied experience and value, not doctrine – very much in line with [emerging evidence that “spirituality” correlates with stronger nature connection globally](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/01/britain-one-of-least-nature-connected-nations-in-world-with-nepal-the-most).

- [[kinship bid possible partners]]

## very rough early thoughts
- the nature of [[experience as transaction]] that is less data driven 
- collective sense (including more than human or trans-human): "where human and nonhuman lives co-constitute each other’s perception and experience." (LLM) -- https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1548-1360.2010.01069.x. Perhaps this is 
- noting large body of work by Nature Connectedness Research Group for empirical work on nature connectedness. (Miles Richardson leads the group and foundations are in ecopsychology). This is a fairly conservative psychological frame.
- how might a new bid looking at embodied experiences with nature tie into: 
	+ other work at C-DaRE? 
	+ research themes at Coventry University?
	+ funding priorities of AHRC and UKRI? 
- how might the research sit within societal and ideological push towards more data and quantifiable experiences? Noting here Harris's emphasis that [[experience matters more than facts]]
- leaning towards working with a group of experienced kinship workshop participants over many seasons -- and could the focus be on communicating that which is difficult to communicate vis a vis collective sensations? Leaning much more into spiritual dimensions of the human and more than human.
