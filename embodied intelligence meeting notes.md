# embodied intelligence meeting notes

_previous note:_ [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project]]

_Meeting Monday 25 September 2023  
Siobhan Davies, Sally Dibb, Jane Aspell, Charlotte Waelde, Simon Ellis_

## Brief notes by SE designed to be a spur to memory (not an exhaustive account)

- Audio recordings (mp3 format): [morning](https://livecoventryac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ac1906_coventry_ac_uk/EQ2Js3IL5AlPnNGy23YYlPwBDVZj8UePvVgbJVsuTTYZjQ?e=1J5Ne5) / [afternoon](https://livecoventryac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ac1906_coventry_ac_uk/EY_UWq8OaHxJtD8htki6ijoBe4q8r-s8gV39QEADXe-k7g?e=JZdESn).
- What do dance experts mean when they say _dance_ and what do non-professionals assume?
- Speculative research
- Adapting a practice research project (Transparencies) for another context – in a sense, to instrumentalise it. Perhaps to use it as a springboard for inquiry.
- Regarding [Transparencies](https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/transparencies), SD: “trying not to make meaning”
- Is there a problem with content moderation online? (we moved away from content moderation and online harm over course of the day – is this an issue?)
- cross- and inter-disciplinary work takes time
- is there evidence of dancers being better at particular tasks?
- The question of transferability – do dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities?
- Some qualitative methods not unlike Transparencies: [Photo elicitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_elicitation) and [photo voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoice). Also discussed [experience sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method).
- We talked about whether Transparencies is the right practice for this nascent research (more on this below).
- Discussion about nomenclature: embodied intelligence, body intelligence, body awareness, body listening, open awareness (etc). How to account for the complexity of embodied expertise of dancers? (assuming they have such expertise)
- Experiential derived vocabulary as a means to understand such complexity
- [Interoceptive Ability Predicts Survival on a London Trading Floor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027524/)
- Tension between assumption that dancers are somehow special (and whether those special capacities are useful in other contexts) and not wanting to reify dance (and to let it be what it is).
- Acknowledging the joy of understanding
- Suggestion of two phases:
	+ 1. qualitative analysis of embodied intelligence of experienced (somatics) practitioners versus novices (ie people not trained in somatic practices) engaged in the Transparencies activity?; use thematic analysis to inform phase 2?
	+ 2. quantitative phase: take one or two aspects of the task (emerging from phase 1) and measure these. These measurements would act as ‘somatic markers’ or proxies. Perhaps this phase might involve learning/training for inexperienced participants
- Transparencies not a typical ‘somatic exercise’ but it might circumvent complexity of involving novices in more conventionally body-based activities (sidenote: people are terrified of anything like dance – I’ve (SE) described a somatic practice called authentic movement to a friend who described it as her ‘worst nightmare’)
- Noting that (contemporary) dancers are very used to approaching abstract and open-ended activities (like Transparencies) without fear of getting them wrong, or being judged, and as processes designed to open-up (creative) possibilities (including memory, imagination, corporeal sensitivity). These are creative processes filled with movement – that shift, change, adapt, morph and bend. This capacity of dancers (and other artists) may be quite distinct from body awareness/intelligence

## Afterthoughts

- On final point above, my (SE) hunch is that this very open attitude towards abstract activities (in which the dancer is given permission and support so as not to feel judged) makes possible heightened body awareness (or _listening_ to the body). If an attitude of “I don’t understand, I need to get this right, what if I get this wrong?” is present, then this would likely make it impossible to be sensitive to the body. The body’s capacity to sense and listen would be ‘blinded’ by doubt and perceived judgement.
- Dancers are in a constant state of exploration and transformation and a reductive approach to this state is somewhat paradoxical (or might de-nature such flux and movement) (SD)
- Is there a way to _lead_ with this dance thinking – movement and transformation? (SD)
- Is it necessary to prove the value of dance? Or perhaps rather a fundamental question might be what is there to be learned from dance/embodied practices for other fields?
- How might we honour the integrity of the Transparencies project while also finding playful and opportune ways to stretch our understanding of both it, and the people who engage with it?
- This is an art-based project (assuming that is we go to AHRC for funding) with support from science and other sources. Might a more quantitative and qualitative understanding of the things ‘we do’ in dance help generate broader understanding (and perhaps even value) for the importance of embodied understandings (whatever such an understanding is)?
