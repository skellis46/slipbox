# the truth must dazzle gradually

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

> But the sun is gloriously indifferent to my desires and pretensions. It cares not whether I would slow or speed its arrival. A fact that, and this is a crucial point, eludes my apprehension most days of the year because I am simply not paying attention or even situated so that I could pay attention.

> And it was good for me to feel this deeply, to be formed in this way. In one sense, of course, I would have affirmed the relevant propositions had I never taken this drive. But it is one thing to assent to or even articulate a proposition, it is quite another, as it turns out, to perceive a truth, if we may call it so, viscerally and poetically, as it was manifested in this compelling this intermingling of mind, body, and world. This, too, is a message of the medium.

- I think the viscerally and poetically perception of truth interests me; perhaps even to do with working with Katye in [[losing oneself]]
