# culture, assumptions and beliefs

_previous note:_ [[somatic feedback interrupts habits]]

---

I read a blog by Rick called [Flip Chart Fairy Tales](https://flipchartfairytales.wordpress.com). It's mostly about economics, but in a recent post he was discussing the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the long-term economy in relation to _culture_. He mentions the renowned organisational development expert [Edgar Schein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Schein) (who I'd never heard of before) and I think it's worth quoting Flip Chart Rick at length here:

>It was Edgar Schein who explained to us, 35 years ago, that culture is a pattern of shared basic assumptions and beliefs. Because these are unspoken, those who share them donâ€™t realise they are doing so. They just carry on assuming. They only stop assuming when the beliefs they have taken for granted are challenged. Even then, they will cling to these beliefs even in the face of powerful evidence. These assumptions and beliefs underpin the behaviour that produces the unwritten rules, the rituals and the visible artefacts that define the society. This is why changing culture is so difficult. Long-term behavioural change only happens when the assumptions and beliefs behind that behaviour change.

I'm fascinated by how unspoken beliefs and assumptions -- our cultural patterns -- are acquired, held and shared.  

_questions & thoughts:_

- Edgar Schein's work, e.g. <https://www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_schein_three_levels_culture.html>
- How might we come to understand our assumptions and beliefs about the body (about our own bodies)? 
- #question What body-based assumptions and beliefs are unspoken or taken for granted? 
- compare with Kahneman's idea that we can't change people's minds (metaphor of spring) in same podcast as [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]] ^4f0c9f
- Part of ongoing interest in [[cognitive biases]]

_consider:_ 

- [[preconceptions and the hermeneutic circle]]
- [[gestell and enframing]]	-- re experiences of things and culture become hidden or unclear
- [[direct experience through the senses]]
- [[search for truth]]
- [[art practice and artistic research]]
