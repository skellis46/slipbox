# looking and listening deeply

_previous note:_ [[the really real]]

> To know the real situation within ourselves, we have to survey our own territory thoroughly, including the elements within us that are at war with each other. To bring about harmony, reconciliation, and healing within, we have to understand ourselves. Looking and listening deeply, surveying our territory, is the beginning of love meditation.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.22] 

> "May I learn to identify and see the sources of anger, craving, and delusion in myself." "To identify" means to recognize the presence of something. "To see the sources" means to understand its nature—where it came from, what circumstances made it arise, and how long it has been there. This is a process of deep looking.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.40] 

> To meditate is to look deeply into the nature of things, including our own nature and the nature of the person in front of us. When we see the true nature of that person, we discover his or her difficulties, aspirations, suffering, and [p.94] anxieties.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings pp.93-94]
