# The principle of wonder

This principle is new for me so I am not sure about it. It is taken directly from the American poet Mary Ruefle: 

> I would rather wonder than know. [...] I think wondering is a way of inhabiting and lingering. [...] as human beings, our impulse is, once we know, once we have the answer, we move on. [Ruefle, in @naimon-2015-mary n.pag.] 

The principle of wonder resists knowing. It asks us to immerse ourselves in uncertainty and not-knowing, and to hold off from producing. It is where human beings make new things possible, and my suspicion is that practice research is uniquely suited to wondering as opposed to knowing.
