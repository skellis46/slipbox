# the dualism of self and other underlies egocentricity

_previous note:_ [[affect vs emotion]]

> The ninth-century Indian philosopher Śāntideva argues in *How to Lead an Awakened Life* (*Bodhicāryāvatāra*) that our conviction that we are selves arises from a primal fear of death, and that we construct the idea of a self as a bulwark against that fear.[10] Śāntideva also argues that the idea that we are selves arises primarily in emotionally charged situations, as when we perceive that we have been harmed, or when pride is aroused. It is then that we think not of our minds or bodies, but of we who possess those minds and bodies. David Hume adopts a similar view. He argues that the thought that we are selves is a product of the passions—that we posit the self as the object of pride and humility, and then reify it in thought.[11] If anything like these analyses is right, the idea of self is grounded not in reason or perception, but in affect.

- [[nonduality]]
- [[the pivot between being and non-being]]
- [[self-consciousness, flow and nonduality]]
- [[Garfield - Losing Ourselves]]
- [[breaking off the human from its sustaining conditions]]
- [[nature, art and habitat proposal]] re anthropogenic climate change

- this is a link between non duality and climate emergency in that the more we fear death the more we construct a self and then the self disengages us from being in relationship with the biosphere. We become separate. See [[Odell - Saving Time]] and a person who is isolated from effects of climate change.
