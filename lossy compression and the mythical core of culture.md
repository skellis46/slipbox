# lossy compression and the mythical core of culture

_previous note:_ [[wokeness and myth]]

---

In _Wokeness and Myth on Campus_ Alan Jacobs discusses operative in technological versus mythical cores of culture. Towards the end of the article Jacobs diverges into a brief discussion of _lossy vs lossless compression_: that in order for large digital files like images, audio and video to be copied and shared it is practical to compress them. However, increased compression results in degradation of the quality of the image, sound or video:  

>Creating compression algorithms is the art of finding the right balance between the virtues of low and high fidelity.[@jacobs_wokeness_2017 p.42] 

Jacobs suggests that because we are living in a uniquely "cognitively complex environment"[p.43] it becomes harder and harder to develop nuanced accounts of experience. His point is that:

>In circumstances of cognitive stress, the need for lossy compression drives us back toward the mythical core of culture.[@jacobs_wokeness_2017 p.43] 

>The discursive complexities of the technological core are more than we can manage; the comparative clarity and immediacy of the mythical become appealing as refuge.[p.43]

_thoughts & links:_

- his point is not to denigrate using 'lossy compression' to help make sense of complex experiences
- I'm reminded of de Sousa Santos' thinking re different resolution levels of methods and theories:

>Boaventura de Sousa Santos’s 2001 article _Toward an Epistemology of Blindness_. In it, he states that “the resolution level of our [scientific] methods is higher than the resolution level of our theories.” [quote from corporeal epistemics](https://www.skellis.net/corporeal-epistemics).
