# the future and technology

_previous note:_ [[the present is usually illegible to itself]]

> To ground ourselves, we can start with two quotes that should inform any estimates about the future. The first is [Amara’s Law:](https://substack.com/redirect/061edffd-10f9-473e-8dab-1702e77e3d43?j=eyJ1IjoiYXZ6eDQifQ.G0OEO2hYU5EfmDn6Y1N-lMJfqyCMC6azYH_trtWPtnc) “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” Social change is slower than technological change. We should not expect to see immediate global effects of AI in a major way, no matter how fast its adoption (and it is remarkably fast), yet we certainly will see it sooner than many people think. (Ethan Mollick from One Useful Thing, Signs and Portents)

> This brings us to our second quote, by William Gibson, who famously wrote “The future is already here - it is just unevenly distributed” - a point backed up by decades of research on user innovation. (Ethan Mollick from One Useful Thing, Signs and Portents)

- [[construal]] -- mentioned in Gibson's Agency.
- [[memory and the future]]
