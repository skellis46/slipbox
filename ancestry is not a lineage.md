# ancestry is not a lineage

_previous note:_ [[your body is an ancestor]]

> You do not need to build an ancestor altar. You do not need to trace your bloodline back ten generations. Ancestry isn’t a lineage. It is a nonlinear tangle of animacy with multiple points of entry. For me, ancestry extends beyond the human. It is rhizomatic, rooting into different species and deep time.[@strand-2021-your n.pag]

> Your body is an ancestor. Your body is an altar to your ancestors. Every one of your cells holds an ancient and anarchic love story. Around 2.7 billion years ago free-living prokaryotes melted into one another to form the mitochondria and organelles of the cells that build our bodies today. All you need to do to honor your ancestors is to roll up like a pill bug, into the innate shape of safety: the fetal position. The curl of your body, then, is an altar not just to the womb that grew you, but to the retroviruses that, 200 million years ago taught mammals how to develop the protein syncytin that creates the synctrophoblast layer of the placenta. Breathe in, slowly, knowing that your breath loops you into the biome of your ecosystem. Every seven to ten years your cells will have turned over, rearticulated by your inhales and exhales, your appetites and proclivity for certain flavors.[@strand-2021-your n.pag]

> You are the ongoing-ness of the dead.

> Your body is an ecosystem of ancestors. An outcome born not of a single human thread, but a web of relations that ripples outwards into the intimate ocean of deep time.
