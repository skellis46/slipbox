# artistic research as analogous to scientific research

_previous note:_ [[epistemic things, technical objects and Duchamp]]

Lesage is describing the situation post Bologna process (1999, see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process>) and the strict idea that teaching should be based on research. The idea meant that teaching in the arts should be based on artistic research. Lesage suggests that this imperative led to the sense that the natural sciences' hegemonic status vis-à-vis research was "under attack".[@lesage_whos_2009 p.5]

>it is my hypothesis that others deliberately (mis)understand the obligation for academies to do research as the obligation to do scientific research because they are actually afraid of... artistic research. The stubborn rhetorical identification of ‘research’ with ‘scientific research’ allows them to get rid of every form of research within the academy.[p.5]

>The notion of artistic research implies that artistic practice can be described in a way more or less analogous to scientific research. An artistic project, then, begins with the formulation, in a certain context, of an artistic problem, which necessitates an investigation, both artistic and topical, into a certain problematic, which may or may not lead to an artwork, intervention, performance or statement, with which the artist positions himself/herself with regard to the initial artistic problem and its context.[@lesage_whos_2009 p.5]

The "analogy argument should be handled with care"[@lesage_whos_2009 p.6]
