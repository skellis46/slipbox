# humanist qualitative methodology was ruined

_previous note:_ [[concept as method]]

Adams St. Pierre writes an extraordinary account of the plethora of 'concept deconstruction' in the early 1990s:

>But I was certainly not the only one deconstructing concepts that structure and organize conventional humanist qualitative methodology in the early 1990s. Lather (1993) and Scheurich (1993) deconstructed validity. Scheurich (1995) deconstructed the interview. In history, Scott (1991) deconstructed experience. Nespor and Barylske (1991) deconstructed narrative; and Visweswaran (1994) and Britzman (1995) deconstructed ethnography. Later, Lather (2000) deconstructed empathy, voice, and authenticity; Jackson (2003) deconstructed voice; and Pillow (2003) deconstructed reflexivity. By then, humanist qualitative methodology was, indeed, ruined.[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.8]

Has it been ruined though?

_thoughts & links:_

- included here because of the power of skittling everything and being left with ... what? It must have been so tempting in those days to ride that deconstruction wave. To tear everything to bits. To say 'nothing' has any value. It leaves me cold -- the cyncism of it, but also the power of it.
