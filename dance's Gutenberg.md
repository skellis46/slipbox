# dance's Gutenberg

>Meanwhile, dancers at home and in their backyards, on school grounds and public plazas, in streets and in clubs, in coffee shops and shopping malls, post their dances on YouTube and Facebook. Dance practices have always been on the move, and no amount of analysis will be able to account for the sheer variety of scenarios in which dancing appears–sometimes in a passing gesture or an accidental syncopated step. With increased access to video documentation, however, dance studies can attend to more aspects of dance’s movements across bodies, across populations and geographic distances, and across media technologies and devices.

>The impact of this unleashing of documentation could not be more profound. It has reshaped how choreographers source and generate movement material, fueling contemporary artists’ turn to the archive for inspiration and re-interpretation. It has altered the landscape of available gestures for both conceptual and popular artists, who find vast treasure troves of “found choreography” in social media sites. It has fundamentally changed the teaching of dance history, which once relied on photographs and grainy bootleg videos. And it has shifted the possibilities (and demands) for contemporary dance studies with the formulation and development of digital research projects. Let me be clear: for those of us who produce or conduct research in the areas of dance, movement, and gesture, this is our “Gutenberg.”
