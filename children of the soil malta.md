## Abstract (300 words maximum)

_Children of the Soil_ is a short film that explores the slow work of growth, gravity and decay. It was created through several practices: 1) falling slowly to the ground; 2) timelapse photography; 3) post-production explorations of spatialising time (using graphic novel 'panels'); 4) texts exploring the more-than-human world (Abram, 1996). I was relatively new to all of these practices before pre-production, although the body-based work is a natural extension of my ongoing corporeal practice. The four practices coalesce around two artistic contexts that I have worked in for 20-30 years: choreography and screendance. I don't yet know how to write about it as research and for which community of practice. I have tried to clarify these issues in a journal article called _Ecosystemic practice-research (for the benefit of others)_ (2023) but tend to think of it as research in and for the screendance community (albeit in an experimental way) that aims to question the role and presence of the human body without simply rendering it invisible.

Texts influenced by -- or drawn from -- the work and ideas of Nils Bubandt, Rainer Maria Rilke, Wendell Berry, Johnny Cash, Brother Phap Dung, Siobhan Davies, Donna Haraway, Heather Swanson, Anna Tsing and Elaine Gan.
