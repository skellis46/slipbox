# body being known

_previous note:_ [[embodiment and illusion of self]]

This comes directly from conversation between Sam Harris and Joseph Goldstein in which Goldstein describes a grammatical 'trick' that removes the subject. For instance, "I know the apple" (or I am knowing this apple) becomes "Apple being known". It got me thinking about knowing the body and how it might be written or spoken as: 

- I am a body
- I have a body 
- I am knowing my body

And these might become versions of:

- body being
- body having 
- body known
- body being known

The critical thing that this structure affords is the subsequent question: known by what? 

Body being known. Known by what? (and that there is nothing to find at that point -- non dual awareness). It seems to me that this might be a way of understanding embodiment. 

Note how Leder in [[the lived body and embodiment]] hints at this (through writing of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, and Straus) but it's so difficult to write about as slips into subject-object constructions: "organised around my corporeal position". Also seems to make the body a special kind of object -- which I am not convinced it is (or that we gain anything by making it so)
