# epistemological core of artistic research is not fixed

_previous note:_ [[something unforeseen]]

[Mika Elo's](https://www.uniarts.fi/henkilot/mika-elo/) chapter in [Futures of artistic research: at the intersection of Utopia, academia and power](https://taju.uniarts.fi/handle/10024/7125) is called _FAQ_. The chapter deals quite directly with the unknown in artistic research and how "sometimes one is lucky enough to come up with a question that points at something unforeseen" (p.49).

Elo writes that the "epistemological core of artistic research is not fixed – some even say it is empty – and appears only indirectly at the intersections or boundaries of different contexts" (p.51).

I take a lot of pleasure in the possibility that when we practice artistic research we might be filling this epistemic core (even if only for the duration of the research) and that the substance of that filling is strongly context dependent. 

Elo's thinking reminded me -- rather tangentially -- of how [Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn) has described meditation as the method of no method. In a way I understand artistic research to be a method of no method. It is certainly not a set of protocols that is more or less followed by its practitioners. 

But where does this very slippery thinking leave artist-researchers new to the field? Is there something more tangible for these people to grasp before they are able to live in the "mangle of practice" (Pickering, 1995) akin to [Keats' negative capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability)?
