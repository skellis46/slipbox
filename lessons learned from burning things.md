# lessons learned from burning things

_previous note:_ [[wood-fired oven]]

From Anil Dash <https://www.anildash.com//2024/11/30/making-fire/>

You’re designing an airflow system with fuel attached

> This is a conceptual shift from how most people think of fires. Unless you’re only burning a single log, you’re going to be replenishing the source of fuel over the lifespan of the fire. So any individual structure or support won’t persist. But what *will* stay constant in a well-made fire is the flow of air and heat that make it possible, with additional fuel being added as needed. So, build that flow and then make everything else subordinate to the ongoing combustion.


Each log is a year

> 	Depending on the species, and the dimensions, each log in your fire might represent the equivalent of a full years' growth for that tree. All of its effort to capture the energy of the sun, for the entirety of an orbit around that star, reduced to the fuel in your hand, and gone before your eyes. Maybe that's something to observe, and to practice being grateful for.
