# the self is another perception

_previous note:_ [[the self is a controlled hallucination]]

> The self is another perception, another controlled hallucination, though of a very special kind. From the sense of personal identity – like being a scientist, or a son – to experiences of having a body, and of simply ‘being’ a body, the many and varied elements of selfhood are Bayesian best guesses, designed by evolution to keep you alive.

- [[you are selfing your experience]]


> We intuitively treat experiences of self differently from experiences of the world. When it comes to the experience of being you it seems harder to resist the intuition that it reveals a genuine property of the way things are – in this case an actual self – rather than a collection of perceptions. One intuitive consequence of assuming the existence of an actual self is that there can be only one such self, not two, or two thirds, or many. (Location 2451)

> Kant, in his Critique of Pure Reason, argued that the concept of the self as a ‘simple substance’ is wrong, and Hume talked about the self as a ‘bundle’ of perceptions. Much more recently, the German philosopher Thomas Metzinger wrote a very brilliant book called Being No One – a powerful deconstruction of the singular self. Buddhists have long argued that there is no such thing as a permanent self and through meditation have attempted to reach entirely selfless states of consciousness. (Location 2457)

> The experience of being me, or of being you, is a perception itself – or better, a collection of perceptions – a tightly woven bundle of neurally encoded predictions geared towards keeping your body alive. And this, I believe, is all we need to be, to be who we are. (Location 2520)

- makes me think about the 'feeling safe' part of [[authentic movement]] (or other practices) -- that it's an environment which ought not to feel life or death (although under certain circumstances and with certain people no doubt it will feel that way)
