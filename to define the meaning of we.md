# to define the meaning of we

_previous note:_

> And that’s partly the point. It’s not about literal truth. But you said, “It gets under our skin by ghosting right past the logical mind,” which gets us into a lot of trouble — by thinking that facts alone can convey truth, for example. And you said metaphors are “like handles on the door of what we can know and what we can imagine.”

Tippett:
>What was it when you were 17 that made you start thinking about that?

Hirshfield:
>You know, I only remember one line of a poem I wrote then, but the line was, “To define the meaning of we is to find a life of a kind, but who is to say?”

> You know, that to me has always — who do we think of, when we use the pronoun “we”? And I want my “we” to be absolutely continuous amongst my fellow humans, amongst living beings, amongst the largeness of the expanding universe, down to the tiniest physics and particle.
