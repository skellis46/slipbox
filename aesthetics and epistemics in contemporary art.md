# aesthetics and epistemics in contemporary art

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experimental systems]]

>contemporary art seems to have managed to bind together two seemingly opposing forces, the aesthetic and the epistemic, without [p.160] installing a meaningful relationship between them that could act as a fail-safe at its borders. On the aesthetic side, contemporary art seems to flirt with the spectacle (Guy Debord), which even when aiming at critical practice risks being quickly absorbed into the marketplace; on the other, epistemic side—sometimes in relation to aesthetics defined as inaesthetics (Alain Badiou) or anaesthetics (Wolfgang Welsch)—we may have political art or institutional critique, in which art risks being overdetermined and made to fit into particular political programmes. (Although with a different aim in mind, Walter Benjamin already defined these two extremes in The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction when in the epilogue he says: “This is the situation of politics which Fascism is rendering aesthetic. Communism responds by politicizing art” [Benjamin 1999, 235].) The problem, though, is not the existence of such extremes; rather, it is that in the centre both paradigms seem to sit side by side without a discernible relationship of a kind that could be open to a critique comparable to the one that might be deployed in the aesthetic or the epistemic alone. The aesthetic and the epistemic almost act as independent variables within contemporary art.[@schwab_experimental_2019 pp.159-160]

_thoughts & links:_

- look up Welsch, Badiou in relation to those terms
- The Benjamin quote makes me think that #practice-research is really something trying to fit into a political (read institutional) programme. It's an unholy conversion -- from art to artistic-research. So where does that leave us/me? What value might there be in the favour being returned? That PaR might somehow be valuable to the arts (outside of the academy). Perhaps this is something for #finger-pointing-moon
