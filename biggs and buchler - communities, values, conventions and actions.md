# biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

---

Biggs and Büchler's describe that in artistic research there are two parent communities in conflict: academic researchers working in the universities, and professional practitioners working in professional contexts like theatres and galleries. These two communities have been "thrown together"[@biggs_communities_2011 p.83] to produce a third community of practitioner-researchers: 

>individuals who hold practitioner values but produce research in an academic context.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.83]

The key idea of this chapter is that the researcher-practitioner hybrid community produces dissatisfaction for both of its parent communities. Biggs and Büchler seek to diagnose this dissatisfaction and how the various communities have responded. 

>as a result of academicization, there is dissatisfaction from the academic community that what practitioners do is not research; and from the practice community that their values are not represented or reflected in academic research.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.89] 

They argue that there should be a distinct research model (not a hybrid) based on the meaningful values and actions of researcher-practitioners.

>Once the fundamental values of the community are visible, then meaningful actions can be identified and the significant activities conventionalized. in this way it will be clear why the practitioner-research community does what it does given what it believes and values.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.98]




>However, it is not the actions that characterize a community because actions on their own do not have meaning. It is only through their inter-connectedness to other meaningful actions that they become significant. Writing a report or making a painting is not significant per se but only as part of a network of other valued actions (Hirsch 1984).[pp.84-85]

>Our definition of academic conventions is that they are a cipher for the network of actions that constitute meaningful research, and establish membership of the community by determining its professional codes and standards. In the same way, the world of professional creative practice has its codes which determine success and by which membership can be judged. We claim this even for contemporary creative practice, which appears to thrive on breaking rules and changing standards. However, in our view the professional practice of any activity is never a case of ‘anything goes’, despite occasional appearances to the contrary.[p.85]

>We believe that academic conventions provide a kind of shorthand for what activities the academic community needs and wants. If these academic conventions are unpacked, it will be possible to identify what are the specific requirements of each academic community. If these conventions are considered as a meta-level system, it will be possible to identify the actions that constitute research activity that is significant to the academic community in general, and that thus reflect the values of the academy. These values include elements such as rationalism – meaning the ability to explain the logical connection between one concept and another; and communication – meaning that ideas are shared and the academic community grows in its knowledge by this process (Searle 1993). The aspect that we focused on was not whether this element or that element was important, but the observation that these elements described actions: the action of rationally connecting ideas, the action of disseminating outcomes, etc. These actions were undertaken because they reflected what the academic community valued, in this case for example, the values of connecting, building and sharing.[p.85]

>Connection through argumentation refers to a structure that produces an argument rather than any one particular argument – meaning that it refers to the rational connection of ideas rather than the advocacy of a particular position.[p.86]
- this is so distinct from [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]]and [[mesearch]]. 

>If research is defined as being cumulative then it is clear that one is concerned with academic research. Therefore the methods need to include inquiry into what has been done already, and making the outcomes public so that other researchers do not duplicate the work. It also clarifies that research is something done by communities resulting in collective benefit rather than by the isolated genius who does not share their work and whose potential contribution remains unknown.[p.86]

>The appropriateness of the answer to the question for the audience will be reflected in the use of methods that appropriately connect one to the other, and are used by the community who form the audience for the outcome. Thus we see that for a community, certain questions are relevant, certain actions are appropriate, and certain outcomes are of interest to their concerns. These communities constitute disciplines, but also share beliefs about what they are doing and therefore inhabit the same larger academic community. Discipline boundaries are defined by identifying communities of practice that share certain interests and concerns, and expressing it in this way brings to the fore the relationship of the community to its research and knowledge base (Wenger 1999). It identifies that certain questions are meaningful, that certain methods are preferred, certain solutions are regarded as satisfying, and others are not.[p.87]

- see [[a border is not a boundary]] while thinking about boundaries of a discipline 



>although these actions conform to the conventions of academic research, they do not result in a significant research activity. as we have said, actions are not meaningful in isolation. The performance of isolated actions results in a loss of coherence and in dissatisfaction.[p.89]


>Certain kinds of form are more effective for the communication of certain kinds of content. In order to understand the relationship between form and content it is necessary to step away from any prescribed form and revisit what is trying to be achieved in the process of research before assuming that this particular form is the best way of achieving that. The inclusion of creative practice in the academic research model requires a justification of whether the non-linguistic form is the most effective way of dealing with the issues at hand in the research.[p.95]


>most creative practices are not undertaken in order to have concrete outcomes and contribute to knowledge. Rather, the majority of creative practices are undertaken to produce experiences.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.94] ^15277b

Their summary:

>In the chapter overview we suggest that there cannot be a single research model that satisfies both communities. We have shown this is because any collaboration between the two communities would involve negotiation and compromise and this would lead to dissatisfaction. As an alternative, we propose that there is a third and distinct community that is the offspring of the two parent communities. In line with the concept of authenticity, there should be a distinct research model that emerges from this community’s own distinct values. This is not a third research model that can be hybridized from the values of the parent community, but instead should be faithfully linked to the values of this new distinct community of practitioner-researchers. The practitioner-research community needs to take responsibility for identifying its practice-academic values and to be critical of any values and conventions they feel they have inherited from their genealogical roots. Once the fundamental values of the community are visible, then meaningful actions can be identified and the significant activities conventionalized. In this way it will be clear why the practitioner-research community does what it does given what it believes and values.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.98]

- this seems like a shift from [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

>owing to the academic interest in accumulation, their activities have as an objective a singular shared interpretation of content.[@biggs_communities_2011 p.92]

- this is intriguing and I'm not sure I agree. I like to imagine that accumulation can still be important even if an interpretation of content is polysemous. That is, accumulation is not dependent on singularity.
