# embodied intelligence - proposal drafts

_previous note:_ [[embodied intelligence project]]

## chatGPT-assisted proposal from CW on 28 September 2023

The human body, with its intricate web of sensations, movements, and emotions, possesses an intelligence of its own, distinct from that of the analytical mind. This embodied wisdom, often eluding verbal description, has been at the heart of somatic practices for centuries. Yet, the relationship between science and somatic practices has historically been characterized as a dance of curiosity, skepticism, and tension (Ginot 2010; Batson et al 2012; Hutt 2010; Williamson 2009; Green 2007; Mehling 2020; Schwartz 2014; Wait 2023). This interplay poses an interesting question: Does a training in somatic practices make a tangible difference to bodily awareness? 

Qualitative research in somatics has traditionally explored the nuances of different practices, their efficacy, particularly in the domains of health and well-being, and their broader utility. Pioneering efforts in the field, such as those centered on "movement-based embodied contemplative practices" (Schmalzl 2014) and "mindful movement practices" (Mattes 2016 p.258), have sought to scientifically validate the potential benefits of these body-centric endeavors and the mechanisms driving change.  

Yet, the realm of somatic practices, and more pointedly, body awareness, remains a territory not fully mapped. Dancers, with their heightened bodily intelligence honed through rigorous somatic practices, offer a unique lens to decode this enigma. What can these artists teach us about the essence of embodied intelligence? 

In a novel attempt to fuse the worlds of art, somatics, and science, this research proposal takes inspiration from the art project "Transparencies" by Siobhan Davies (2020). This artistic endeavor presents an opportunity to delve into the intricate interplay between visual images, bodily awareness, and the range of emotional and non-conceptual responses they evoke. A pivotal question underpinning this exploration is whether those immersed in somatic practices, like contemporary dance, engage with the Transparencies methodology and its images differently compared to those untrained in somatics.  

To address these pressing queries, our research will harness a diverse array of mixed methodologies. By directly comparing two distinct groups—one steeped in the practice of somatics and the other with little to no exposure—we aim to uncover nuances in embodied awareness. Age and demographic factors will be accounted for to ensure comparability between the groups. Through qualitative self-reporting scales, such as the MAIA-II interoceptive awareness test [@mehling-2018-multidimensional], the five-facet mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ) [@baer-2008-construct], and the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) [@shields-1989-body], along with subsequent interviews and thematic analysis, we aspire to illuminate the oft-hidden facets of body intelligence and its relevance in our increasingly disembodied society.

- Prompts for above as follows: 
	+ Write a research proposal around the following research questions.  
	+ Does a training in somatic practices make a difference to bodily awareness?  If it can be shown that it does, what can broader society learn from that body intelligence? Could it be used, for example, to help us to determine what harmful internet content is?  
	+ Use the following in developing the proposal  
		- science and somatic practices have a long, strange and sometimes troubled relationship (e.g. Ginot 2010; Batson et al 2012; Hutt 2010; Williamson 2009; Green 2007; Mehling 2020; Schwartz 2014; Wait 2023)  
		- historically qualitative somatics research has focused on detailing different practices, efficacy of such practices (particularly re health and well-being), and their utility. 
		- scientific research into somatic practices, body awareness, "movement-based embodied contemplative practices" (Schmalzl 2014)  and other "mindful movement practices" (Mattes 2016 p.258) has, not surprisingly, attempted to verify the potential benefits of such body-based practices, and potential mechanisms for change.  
		- but what of the role of somatic practices -- and specifically body awareness   
		- what can we learn from somatic practices and specifically dancers about embodied intelligence?  
		- can we use the method underlying the art work Transparencies (Siobhan Davies, 2020) as a vehicle/activity to deepen understanding of the complex interactions between images, body awareness and affective responses (including non-conceptual content) while witnessing and engaging with a somatically informed art project.   
		- will those trained in bodily practices (somatics; contemporary dance) think/react differently to the Transparencies methodology and the images that is uses as compared with those who are not somatically trained?  
		- use a range of mixed methodologies to directly compare two groups of people: one group of experts in somatic practices; the other group with little or no experience of somatic practices. The groups will be matched for age and demographics. Use a series of qualitative self-reporting scales (e.g. MAIA-II interoceptive awareness test, five facet mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), and Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ, Shields et al., 1989)), interviews with subsequent thematic analysis
