# descriptions and sense data

_previous note:_ [[literature notes/Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature]]

---

Noë is discussing consciousness and how we experience things. He contrasts the perspective of Cartesian philosophers and modern-day neuroscientists -- "The idea of a world beyond consciousness ... that we construct or build up out of the data of sense"[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 16. The Sound of Music, n.p.] -- with his own (more traditional) philosophical view:

>there is no accurate, no faithful description of how things seem—of our conscious experience itself [...] If we want to confine our attention to what we really know, then what we really know is that that is how things seem to be. As the philosopher P. F. Strawson famously argued: we don’t step forward from sense data to build up a conception of the world. We step back from the world, in thought, to contrive the idea of sense data.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 16. The Sound of Music, n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- #finger-pointing-moon 
- I wonder how this contrasts my interest/curiosity in what is observable in practice-research (and perhaps relates to [[critical realism]]). My thought is that I'm in the middle of this work -- between _experience_ and _stepping back_. That is, I'm interested in working at the level of observation and perhaps even nomenclature (and understanding the limits of these in artistic practice). This is a person. Her arms are in the air. This is what "we really know": it is how things seem to be
