# ancestors provide the range of what it is to be human

_previous note:_ [[genuine emergency and cultural output]]

> Someone asked Zhaozhou,
> “Why did Bodhidharma come from the west?”
> Zhaozhou replied, “The cypress tree in the garden.”[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 11 The Cypress Tree in the Garden]

> If you just see your own kitchen without fear and longing, without veils, then it could be intensely alive. At a moment like that, Bodhidharma is looking at the kitchen. When you look at the counters, the verticality of the walls, the window, the tiles, the precision of the corners of the room, the cypress tree outside the window, the branches of the laurel entwined with it and the pickup with big wheels parked in the drive, you are already looking with Bodhidharma’s eyes. The thusness of things steps forward out of a surrounding darkness. Whatever you see might seem to have been present from everlasting, and to have an exactness, an emphatic quality of being precisely what it is. This is not the usual way to think of an inheritance: it isn’t the armchairs and titles to land that are handed down, but the eyes to see with.

> Then he looked at trees. His discoveries didn’t feel personal; he didn‘t think them up; it was just that while he kept company with this koan, a larger point of view appeared. He and a tree were both an act of imagination on the part of the universe. In some way he could honestly say, “I am a tree.”
> He also said, “With this koan there was a period when I identified with everything. I would go for a walk downtown and become the Styrofoam cup, the tree, the dog, the homeless person. I had always identified with the foreground of life, but now I was identifying with the background. At first I knew that I was the tree but I didn’t yet know that I was Zhaozhou. 

> There is a tendency to think that the goodness of ancestors is necessary; yet that can’t be true, since everyone has criminal ancestors somewhere in the tree. If Hitler was your ancestor, you bear no guilt. If Buddha was your ancestor, you bear no credit. The more you get to know them in a genuine way, as the painter did, the more your relationship with your ancestors grows and changes and becomes interestingly complicated. Genghis Khan is a national hero in Mongolia, though not in China. I have navigated using charts drawn by Captain Cook, yet he is not a culture hero to Australian Aborigines.

> Ancestors provide the range of what it is to be human—the kindness and terror, the shame and forgiveness that you have to come to terms with to be able to bless your life.[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 11 The Cypress Tree in the Garden: The Trouble with Ancestors]
