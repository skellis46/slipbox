# unlocking keywords

_previous note:_ [[keywords]]

I've been reading a remarkable edited collection by Joel Burges and Amy J. Elias called _Time: a vocabulary of the present_. I highly recommend it, particularly if you make films ... or exist in the past, present or future. 

In their introduction, Burges and Elias worry that those words _past_, _present_ and _future_ seem too limited to express our complex experiences of time. Rather, they describe how these words might be _keywords_ in the original sense of that word: "a word that acts as the key to a cipher or code"[^1]. That is, according to Burges and Elias, the words _past_, _present_ and _future_ function as ciphers that "unlock the historicity of time."[^1]

Here are Jachin and Boaz writing in _Jerusalem Lodge_ in 1762:

> If they could not find a Key-Word about him, it was lost, for there were only three in the World to whom it was known.[^2]

Speaking of being lost, here's a drawing I happened across just the other day. Must have been my first existential crisis back in about 1972. Note whoever-it-was's feedback in the corner. Good! Good what? Talk about being left hanging.

But back to keywords.

I suspect I'm not alone in having never thought about the origins of the term _keyword_ and was flabbergasted by how knowing those origins has made me think how lazy or perhaps limited I have been when considering their value.   

By the time you read this I'll be just starting in a period of creative research and practice at [NAHR](https://nahr.it) in Italy for a project that has a working title _Footfall_. In my preparation I've been taking a lot of care considering the ways in which keywords might broaden my understanding of the practices, but also bring those practices into some tension. 

I wondered what it even might be like to incorporate some initial keywords -- _ground_ and _falling_ -- into a haiku, as if attempting to wrestle the keywords into a different form. Here's one to close this brief email:

Summer din—
A man falls to the ground
Earth pays no mind
