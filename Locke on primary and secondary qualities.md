# Locke on primary and secondary qualities

_previous note:_ [[embodied intelligence project]]

> Enlightenment philosopher John Locke called ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ qualities. Locke proposed that the primary qualities of an object are those that exist independently of an observer, such as occupying space, having solidity, and moving. An oncoming train has these primary qualities in abundance, which is why jumping in front of one is a bad idea, whether or not you are observing it, and whatever beliefs you might hold about the nature of perception. Secondary qualities are those whose existence does depend on an observer. These are properties of objects that produce sensations – or ‘ideas’ – in the mind, and cannot be said to independently exist in the object. Colour is a good example of a secondary quality, since the experience of colour depends on the interaction of a particular kind of perceptual apparatus with an object.
