# the scale-dependence of emptiness and form

[Lsusr](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/lsusr) describes the difference between form and emptiness as being one of scale. In fundamental physics a cat "is a collection of particles no more special than any other collection of particles". This is emptiness. But a cat can also be a representation created by the human mind. This is form. 

>The perspective "cats are real" is called "form". The perspective "cats are an arbitrary ontology with no well-defined meaning amongst the fundamental laws of the universe" is called "emptiness". There is no conflict between form and emptiness just as there is no conflict between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. They are different ways interpreting the same thing at different scales.[@lsusr-2020-emptiness n.pag.]

Lsusr loosely connects emptiness and form with the [[map and territory]] dichotomy where form corresponds to map and emptiness to territory. However, the comparison is not quite right according to Lsusr because the map and territory refer to reality and models of reality. They describe this as a materialist perspective. In contrast, the form-emptiness dichotomy is an "informatic perspective":

>If there is no difference between a map and a territory then—mathematically—the map and the territory are isomorphic respresentations of the same group.[@lsusr-2020-emptiness n.pag]

But where Lsusr's post gets interesting for me is in their discussion of ontologies. The world as emptiness is transformed into an ontology called _form_ through our subjectivity ("our Bayesian priors"). Lsusr uses a sigmoid function to illustrate form and emptiness:

>When we zoom in we see continuity (emptiness), which is a prerequisite for gradient descent. When we zoom out, we see a discrete system (form), which is necessary for the emergence of ontologies. Emptiness and form work together to produce emergent ontologies.[@lsusr-2020-emptiness n.pag]

_thoughts & links:_

- I'm surprised at the elegance of this thinking, and it pushes all sorts of buttons for me in my early understanding of discrete and analog systems
- [[analog chauvinism and the qualitative]] and also re analog and digital philosophers
- reminds me somewhat of poiesis in [[technics, techne, and technology]] and similar emergent ontologies are (through our 'Bayesian priors' and subjectivity)
- not clear though how to relate to [[modes of thought and practices enabled by modes of thought]] in how ontological are "practices enabled by modes of thought" and the epistemological are the modes of thought. 
- also links with my other writing on long-time thinking and stewardship; e.g. in [ellis-2019-pause.pdf](hook://file/uT1QQvcSq?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=ellis-2019-pause.pdf)
