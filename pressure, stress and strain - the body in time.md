# pressure, stress and strain - the body in time

### self-introduction: I am a body

Good morning everyone. It is an honour and a pleasure to be here with you this morning. Actually, in the last two years it has become hard for me to even imagine what it's like to be _with_ other people; and it's not so accurate to say I am _with_ you. I'm not even with you on the same screen. Isn't it true that screens are now the principle means by which we humans are atomised? Perhaps we are on the same cloud-based server? I am honoured to be on the same web server as you this morning. Actually I suspect that's not right either. Perhaps all I can say is that I am honoured to be on Zoom at the same time as you. Let's go with that. 

My name is Simon Ellis and, just in case you are wondering, I have a body, and this body is not just a head and shoulders.(add image of me as I am sitting there) 

That word _have_ in "I have a body" is strange isn't it? Like a possession. As in: I have a car; I have a washing machine; I have a mind, or I have a cat. If I were to say "I am a body" then, in English at least, it seems to diminish my agency or identity, as if I am _only_ a body. How would that idea translate? Into Cantonese? Italian? Farsi? 

So in English when we say "I have a body" it's hard to shake this sense of it being something external that we have possession of. In their 2021 book called _The Dawn of Everything_, anthropologist David Graeber and archeologist David Wengrow describe the sacred quality of private property in historical European social thought, and how this sacred quality extends to ownership of our own bodies as a kind of human right. The Canadian political scientist C. B. Macpherson called this _possessive individualism_ in how we are thought to be the sole proprietors of our skills (and by extension our bodies), and how we owe nothing to society for them.[@little-2011-possessive]

In saying all this -- in this rather strange introduction -- you might have guessed that I am a dancer, and to state the most obvious of facts, this means I am interested in the body, in bodies, in your bodies, in my body, in the human body and indeed the bodies of animals. In that same book by Graeber and Wengrow they describe "extremely human activities" like "gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag] I love that dancing is up there with gossip and arguing as an extremely human activity. 

I make dance performances and films and I've been doing this for more than 30 years. They have all been tiny. Small scale. Insignificant. I am unheralded. Unheard of. Perhaps this is where human beings are most equal: in our complete cosmic insignificance. Perhaps Walt Whitman was wrong, and we are actually not large, and we do not contain multitudes. These performances I made were microscopic. No, that's not true, all were able to be seen with the naked eye although I like the idea of making literally microscopic dances. Each of these choreographies reflected my interests -- and the interests of the people I collaborated with -- at those times. They reveal the changes in my interests through my life as an artist, and the things that have not changed. (show stills). You might even say -- if you were being unkind -- that these choreographies were all really just about me. It's fine, by the way, if you'd like to be unkind. You can be unkind right there in the Zoom chat. Could there be a more contemporary way to start an online conference than with a bit of chat-room trolling? 

The thing when you _are_ a body, and a body that performs, it's hard for choreographies not to be thought to be personal or about you (even if you don't want them to be). The emeritus professor of medicine and mindfulness Jon Kabat-Zinn describes how, in meditation (and in life) even the _not me story_ is the _story of me_.

What follows this morning is a guided tour -- or maybe even misguided tour -- of the body under pressure and in time. There will be a few diversions, a brief aside, perhaps even a dead-end if we are lucky. I make some claims, share some ideas, and propose something for us to consider in relation to experiences of stress, and what this might mean for artistic (and perhaps pedagogic) practices, including those that are called artistic research practices. But at its heart this talk is about the kinds of things we make and for whom -- and for when -- they are made. 

### a brief aside [.ptbrief]

There's an Artificial Intelligence theorist whose name is Eliezer Yudkowsky. He is also the founder of the rationalist website _LessWrong_. Yudkowsky is perhaps best known for creating the term "friendly artificial intelligence." In his formerly prolific blogging days he used to drop in what he called _meditations_. He describes these meditations as being like "puzzles"[@yudkowsky-2012-useful n.p.] designed to help people remember the ideas in the writing. I'm going to steal Yudkowsky's idea at various moments in this presentation but with two different purposes in mind. The first is to recognise that time in this online space -- a webinar -- is experienced as a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances and limits. To give you space to rest your eyes, and to acknowledge that how I choreograph this space-time makes a difference to how you experience it. The second is to provoke specific reflections from you. Each _meditation_ will last just 1 minute, and each will give you a chance to rest, reflect, note, imagine, drift or engage as you prefer. I imagine some of you might even flick over to check your email -- maybe something important has arrived. You. Never. Know.

So, let's try one, even at this early stage of the talk.

_Meditation 1:_ If a practice is something we do regularly or repeatedly then what is your practice? Not what you think it is, or what you want it to be, but what it actually is. 

Here's 1 minute. [timer.mp4]

### understanding practice-research

At a certain point -- just over 20 years ago -- I started to integrate ideas about research into my dancing practice. I don't mean the commonplace kind of research that artists do into the subject of their work. For instance, if you were developing an artistic project about, say, climate change, then you'd do a whole lot of reading and background research into climate change. Your research would be a way for you to gather images, ideas, inspiration ... to become informed on the subject matter, while also stoking or loading your imagination. It's more like background information to be more informed, and there are no parameters for how the research might happen. I'm not talking about that kind of research -- like when funding organisations talk about 'research and development'. Not that there's anything wrong with this kind of research.

Here's a brief and rather curious list. 

- Science research  
- Pizza research 
- Music research 
- Dance research  

When we attach the word 'research' to anything it implies a desire to find out or understand something differently. If I say to a friend that I need to do some research before choosing a pizzeria tonight they'd understand that there's a decision to be made, and that without the _research_ we might not make the best decision. 

Now let's apply two different words to each of the items in the list above:

- research about science / research through science  
- research about pizza / research through pizza  
- research about music / research through music  
- research about dance / research through dance  

The word _about_ tells us the object of the research, but not how that research might happen. For example, research _about_ music might be something relatively informal or trivial like a web search to find the latest release from a particular artist. But research _about_ music also might use formal historical methods (with the traditions or conventions that historians use) to understand a piece of music differently. In the same way, research _about_ dance might use anthropology, history, sociology, or science (etc) as methods to increase human understanding of dance. 

When we research _through_ something a method is already implied, but the object is not. Research through science uses the scientific method to explore a phenomenon. Research through dance uses the practices of dance in order to explore ideas, phenomena, etc. In both cases, what is able to be examined, what is understood, and how understanding is presented (or made accessible) is in no small part determined by the methods used. 

This is what practice-as-research is. It is when we investigate ideas through artistic practices. It is not necessarily _about_ those practices (although it might be), but it is most definitely through those practices. 

### jump cut to talk about pressure, stress and strain; oh ... and neoliberalism

I have a friend who is an exercise physiologist. His name is Jim, Jim Cotter. Here he is. Not so long ago he and I were in a car together and I asked Jim if he was stressed. He smiled because his first thought was to think of stress the way physical scientists or engineers think about the term. It goes something like this:

Stress is "generated whenever a force is applied on a body to deform it" <https://whatispiping.com/pressure-vs-stress/>. Stress is produced inside a material body and is the _intensity_ of internal resistance to the force or pressure applied. 

Pressure, then, is the "intensity of external forces acting at a point." Pressure is exerted on the body.<https://whatispiping.com/pressure-vs-stress/>

Jim also used another word: strain.

Strain is how stress is measured in the physical sciences, and is a material property of a body's change in shape. It refers to the "amount of deformation experienced by the body" in the direction of an applied force <https://byjus.com/physics/stress-and-strain/#what-is-strain> Think of how a flexible body responds to pressure -- an external force -- differently from a rigid body. Not better or worse, just differently. 

In psychology, stress is the feeling we get when we perceive pressure from internal or external conditions as being beyond our ability to cope. In both understandings of stress, it's useful to note that there is a point beyond which we -- our bodies, or the material bodies in question -- cannot cope. There is some quantity of psychological or physical deformation beyond which we -- or systems, or bodies -- break. We cannot continue deforming. 

In the arts and humanities in the UK, when we talk about pressure, stress and strain at work, we often pair those experiences or feelings with the word neoliberalism. That, in some way, neoliberalism generates pressure that causes stress that -- in time -- we feel unable to cope with. That we are being deformed by neoliberalism. 

I don't want to get into the nuts and bolts of neoliberalism, but I also want to take care not to write it off because the everyday version of this "uninhibited private market"[@verdouw-2017-subject p.524] -- most commonly associated with Reagan and Thatcher in the 1980s -- underpins unregulated hyper-individualism, ill-conceived faith in the meritocracy,[@sandel-2020-tyranny] loneliness, and the commodification of behaviour and thought.[see for instance, @zuboff-2019-age] It drives the idea that each of us is solely responsible for continual production. The pressure to produce without careful consideration of the physical, temporal, material and psychological resources available both now and in the future is disastrous. This. Now this. Now this. _This_ is a body under pressure. 

[hamster.mp4]

Each of us -- as academics, as artists, as teachers, as human beings -- will have felt these demands in various ways. But the worst part of it -- at least in terms of this presentation -- is that "short-termism is built into the genetic code of the neoliberal paradigm."[@krznaric-2021-good p.196]

### zoom in: presence, body-based practices and now

In which I discuss short-termism, two paradoxical kinds of _now_, and the future.

#### being present

In this moment, this body that seems to be me -- or that I call _mine_ -- is sitting in front of a screen. How does _your_ body feel right now? Where does it feel right now? What weighs heavily on your body that you might let go of? Isn't it remarkable -- and beautiful -- that you are able to recognise these feelings in your body and recognise them as belonging to you? **Damasio and consciousness??**

In dance and performance practices -- both in and outside of the University -- what do we artists do? We make performances. They are performances of enormously different scales, shapes, sizes, and colours. Sometimes they involve many many people, other times just a few (rarely just one, even when we call them "solos"). They are sometimes unpopular, sometimes popular. Sometimes they are under-developed, sometimes over-cooked, sometimes successful, sometimes not (however you might imagine 'success' to be gauged) They express ideas, they captivate, they alienate, they distract, they are didactic, they are open to interpretation. In dance -- or at least in so much of dance -- they are people moving (sometimes to music, sometimes not). 

I'd also like to propose that one thing all dance (perhaps all performance including theatre and opera) has in common -- from social dancing, to artistic dancing -- is a concern for, pleasure in, and deep curiosity about something that is called many things, but most often _presence_. That _being present_ is an essential part of dancing (and performance) -- perhaps even an essential part of being human -- and somehow not being present is a bad thing, or something to be avoided. Being present is the opposite of blanking while performing; or being so self-conscious -- or perhaps hyper-judgmental -- while out social dancing that your body refuses to move, or you refuse to move it. Remember your cousin Jo's wedding?

And if you were to quietly agree with me, at least for a moment, that being present -- whatever that really is -- seems important, then it is more than a little odd that most products or things we make -- including performances -- were summed up by the economist Kate Rawroth as "take, make, use, lose."[Raworth, in @krznaric-2021-good p.206] In other words, we take the Earth's materials, make them into things we want or like, use them a bit (or present them), and then they are discarded or lost. Which is not to say that they don't produce some cultural value.

I think you can entertain or imagine the tension or contradiction between such a mode of production, and a set of artistic practices predicated on presence. It's a strange formula:

Take. Make. Use. Lose. Oh, and yeah, be present. 

#### one type of now: process-oriented body-based artistic practices

The linear model of production in dance and performance is disheartening and unsustainable. The feeling of running to stand still is stronger and stronger, and the economics no longer add up, if they ever did. Under these conditions of production, I've become increasingly curious about process-oriented body-based practices, and I've done this for a number of reasons: i) my aging body -- it is physically capable of less. In case you were wondering, this is also called _making a virtue out of necessity_; ii) each choreography, each performance seems to take longer and longer to make (and to use more and more resources), but is seen or presented fewer and fewer times; iii) a deeper focus on research through practice; iv) the desire to seek practices that don't fit or make sense in current models of production.  

By process-oriented body-based practices, I mean things like somatics that distinguish the body as observed from the outside -- the body as spectacle or as it is seen -- versus the soma as perceived from the inside. These are practices known by names like Feldenkrais, Alexander technique, Body Mind Centering and Skinner Releasing Technique. 

The distinction I've just stated between inner and outer worlds, between what can be seen and what can only be felt, is an important one. It is perhaps even _radical_ given our oculocentric TikToking Instagramming world, and that body-based practices like somatics seem to resist so many of the tropes of the body under pressure: pressure to take, pressure to make, pressure to use, pressure to lose. The pressures of production.

If I push a bit further and consider body-based practices within the context of practice-research, then such practices become vital and difficult for five reasons: 

1. These body-based practices have a complex and often fraught relationship with language. That is, how does descriptive or analytical language function with these practices? 
2. The experiential nuances are felt, and not seen. 
3. Body-based practices intersect with contested issues of so-called embodied knowledge and tacit awareness. That is, when doing these practices, how might we recognise what is understood or known by the practitioners and how that understanding changes through time? 
4. These practices complicate decades-old problems in practice-research to do with arts practices that are ephemeral (or that 'disappear') and how they might be documented, and how they even resist documentation. 
5. Finally, body-based practices ask us to slow down. They introduce "slack time"[@munger-2021-it n.pag], a chance to adjust ourselves to different experiences of the unfolding of time. 

In fact, somatics practitioners are so enamoured with slowness that they use the Weber-Fechner Law to justify working at slow and deliberate speeds.[e.g. Shusterman, in @ginot-2010-shusterman] The Weber-Fechner Law describes the relationship between the actual change in a stimuli and the perceived change. For example, if a stimulus has an initial value of 1 arbitrary unit, and is increased by 10, our perception of this change will be very different if, for example the initial value is 400 and is increased to 410. In other words, if we slow the body right down, then our sensitivity to the same _quantity_ of change is heightened.

Another somatic practice commonly used in dance is the oddly named Authentic Movement. Authentic Movement was developed for therapeutic situations, but it is also used by dance and movement artists as a way to tune the body's senses, and less commonly as choreographic process and performance.[e.g. @mcleod-2016-movement] Authentic Movement does not require participants to be experienced or trained. There are two roles; the first is the mover who has their eyes closed. This person moves in direct response to what they are noticing, experiencing, feeling, sensing or imagining. Their task or activity is to be awake to the "full universe of sensations associated with the body being itself,"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon n.pag] and to cultivate awareness without judgement. The other person keeps the mover safe, and simply observes them without judgement. After the improvisation -- which might last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour (or longer), the mover reflects verbally on their experience while the watcher listens. They then change roles. Two people, one observing their inner world and moving, the other observing the other person in the outer world. 

The distinction between inner and outer worlds, between what is felt and what is seen, is critical. The distinction reminds us that when we are dealing with body-based practices what we can observe bears little or no relationship to the experiential complexity of what happened.  

I see Authentic Movement as a body-based process that involves empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation, and although it is simple to describe, it generates complex psycho-physical experiences. What is profound about the experience is the simple-in-theory attempt to practice observation (internally and externally) without judgement. How often in our lives -- other than when we were very small children -- do we get to move, play and be supported without judgment? Even just imagining the attempt to stop judging ourselves and others is destabilising for many people. What remains beyond judgement? 

It might already seem quite clear to you that given all of this Authentic Movement is akin to a contemplative practice like mindfulness; a set of processes in which we practice "the timeless present we call now";[Kabat-Zinn in @mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon _Mindfulness of the body as a whole_ n.pag.] where we breathe and move out of clock time and into non-judgemental awareness. 

Curiously, the Pali term _sati_ (or _smṛti_ in Sanskrit) was first translated into English as _mindfulness_ in 1881 by English scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids. Sati means memory or to remember and this sense of remembering is lost in the English translation _mindfulness_. The meditation teacher and author Sebene Selassie writes of the importance of remembering in contemplative practices -- of coming back to the body (she calls this _bodyfulness_), or re-membering the body:

>Interestingly, to dismember means to pull the body apart piece by piece ... Maybe we are re–membering. [...] coming to our senses, cultivating an embodied awareness ... putting our bodies back together breath by breath.[@selassie_getting_nodate n.d.; n.p.]

I am talking through all of this background in somatics and Authentic Movement because I understand the concept of presence in the performing arts to be _non-judgemental awareness_. It's the keystone of dancing, and perhaps all of the performing arts; it's akin to Csikszentmihalyi's famous concept _flow_[@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow] in which concepts of self seem to fall away; that the language and sense of I, I, I, me, me, me, and my, my, my, is rendered obsolete, or has no place in non-judgemental awareness. 

But so what?

I want to propose that such practices remind us that there is an opportunity -- regardless of the practices we are involved in as artists, or teachers or researchers -- to seek methods of doing what we do that distill production from consumption. I'll say that again: to seek methods of creating and making that distill production from consumption. That rather than making something simply to be seen (or consumed in some other way), we interrogate our responsibilities as practitioners and seek to de-instrumentalize processes of making in order to understand more deeply their purpose; to consider deeply that to understand their purpose (including the possibility that they have no purpose) is one's only task. That as soon as we fall out of flow, or cease "holding the whole body in awareness"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon] we jolt into the unwieldy self-consciousness of instrumental production: I do this in order to get this sometime in the near future. These are our bodies that gravitate towards wondering what something might bring us. Under these conditions, all roads lead to mesearch. The consequences of this gravitational pull towards I, I, I, me, me, me, my, my, my, are devastating. They are devastating not only because of the profound internal and external stresses created by short-term production, but because they lead us to turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] 

But more of this in a moment. 

---
_Meditation:_ We don't _have_ time, we _are_ time. 

Consider this for 1 minute.

---

#### a brief excursion into another type of now

I want to briefly note that there is another type of now that is different in kind from what I've just been describing as presence based on non-judgemental awareness. It is summed up by the cultural anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson as follows:

> "the great irony of our time is that even as we are living longer, we are thinking shorter.” This is the age of the tyranny of the now.[Bateson, in @krznaric-2021-good pp.4-5]

The _sine qua non_ contemporary mode of Bateson's tyranny is doom-scrolling. The philosopher of technology Albert Borgmann -- building on the thinking and writing of the Trappist monk Thomas Merton -- describes technologically induced distraction as a "permanent, if attractively glamorous, fog".[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.8]

Distraction under these everyday day conditions is time unfelt as it is smothered or erased by streams of algorithmically delivered images. It is a feeling of being _lost in now_ closely related to neoliberally induced hyper-productive busyness, and is the precise opposite of the timeless quality of now experienced by holding the body in non-judgemental awareness. I see this as a kind of paradox of time, or perhaps paradox of now. One version of _now_ voids the past, present and future. The other harnesses the present to expand our understanding, experience and imagination of the past and the future. 

And it is to the future that I want to turn.

### zoom out: artistic practices for the future

In which I // A small section that seems to be a diversion but ends up being a transition into the heart of this presentation.

#### Being out of touch

What became clear, even in the earliest days of the pandemic, was that touching others -- making physical contact with others -- was under direct and immediate pressure to change. We went from people who touch each other all of the time (in different circumstances, conventions and situations) to a species that avoided touch. We avoided touch to protect ourselves and to protect others. For some, this was a kind of relief from social awkwardness; for others not at all. We became out of touch.

To be _out of touch_ in English means of course to be disconnected or out of date, as if we have no remaining touch left: "Sorry I'm all out of touch. I have no touch left to give." The way in which middle-aged people become out of touch with the culture and language of young people. 

Yet during this pandemic we have all felt the pressure to stay connected or be in touch. We experienced -- and likely still experience -- zoom fatigue. A kind of hyper-connectivity made possible by 21st century digital technologies. We were desperate to stay in touch while knowing deep down in our zoom-fatigued bodies that we also remained profoundly out of touch. Touch was dangerous. Touch was certainly no longer innocent (was it ever?). Touch led to virality.

As we homo sapiens worked hard to be physically out of touch with each other, I reflected on the possibility that all of this work -- and in particular all of _my_ work -- was out of touch. This has nothing at all to do with the pandemic and everything to do with fire. 

In _On Time and Water_ Andri Magnason reminds us of the mid to late 1700s in Scotland when James Watt gifted humankind the steam engine. Magnason describes it beautifully:

> Watt allowed us to tame fire; gradually we learned to hide the flames better, isolating the heat, smoke and soot until fire has become invisible under the glossy hoods of air-conditioned cars that go cruising around the world with their upholstered seats and pumping music.[@magnason-2021-time p.191]

That this is really how we humans are out of touch. That the mechanisms by which we burn resources are powerfully hidden from view. These invisible fires have fueled, and continue to fuel, what is now commonly -- but not officially in the geologic time scale -- referred to as the anthropocene.

I wonder if you are still with me. I seem to have created a terrible mess here. How to knit together these various things I've placed in or on this shared desktop? You see I am trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, rapacious human body, and to make sense of it in a way that each of us might find useful. This is not some abstract, hypothetical game with no consequences. Pressure. Stress. Strain. Time. That when I start to reflect critically on the work I'm doing, and while taking into account time beyond one's own lifetime, individualism, now-ness, personal ambition, and most pressing of all the climate emergency, I start to wonder, what might a body-based practice be in the long now? In deep time? What might it be like to be "blinded by the excess of clarity"?[@merton-1954-elected p.30]

#### The game of people you have loved and who will love you

There's a simple game to play. I first read about it in _On Time and Water_. The game is to measure the span of time of people you have loved and who will love you.[@magnason-2021-time p.308]

Here's my version. My grandmother, Gladys Hopkins, was born in December 1913. Here she is singing. Gladys gave birth to my mother, Gabrielle Eastwood-Ellis, in 1937. Here she is in 1960. I was born in 1968, and here I am in about 1973. My niece Rebecca was born in 1980; and Rebecca's daughter -- my great niece -- Zoe Ellis-Craig was born in 2016. If we imagine that Zoe lives until she is 90 then this would mean she would die in 2106. 

Gladys: 1913 - 2005  
Gabrielle: 1937 - 2021  
Simon: 1968 -  
Rebecca: 1980 -   
Zoe: 2016 - 

That is 193 years of people I have loved and who have loved me. 193 years. This small, insignificant, delicate body extended through time, and "beyond the ego boundary of [my] own mortality".[@krznaric-2021-good pp.14-15] This body's hopes, dreams, traumas, desires, and limitations; its 206 discrete bones, 650 or so muscles, and 100 billion neurons. This a body that counts. These are the bodies that count. 

#### To be a good ancestor

There's another version of this game in which you imagine yourself to be that last person you know who will love you -- in this case my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig -- and write a letter to yourself as if you were the elderly version of that person. Might she describe me as a good ancestor? That these practices of performance, dance and film are in fact insignificant compared with how I stepped on the planet so that I might have been a good ancestor for Zoe Ellis-Craig? Will she judge my life as "laughable and foolish"[@magnason-2021-time p.259] or recognise how I squandered resource after resource making dances about myself? Will she recognise how even the _not me dances_ were really the _me dances_? 

In this part of the presentation I'm going to draw heavily on the writing of Roman Krznaric, who describes himself as a "public philosopher." In particular, I'm using some of the ideas he presents in his remarkable book _The Good Ancestor_ (2021), and I want to acknowledge just how inspiring that writing has been for me. It also happens to be a coincidence that when I was asked to present to you I just happened to be reading it.

Krznaric mentions a person called Jonas Salk. He looked like this. Salk died in 1995, and he was an American virologist and medical researcher most famous for one thing: the development of the polio vaccine. Salk refused to patent the vaccine so it would be a gift to humanity, and he also said that the most important question we must ask ourselves is this:

"Are we being good ancestors?"

I love this question. It is haunting, and for me it operates on two profound levels. The first is that it engenders a strong sense of what Krznaric describes as "deep-time humility"[@krznaric-2021-good p.39] in which our radical insignificance as organisms liberates us from the distracted now. The second is about responsibility, and here Krznaric cites the philosopher Derek Parfit's concept of the arrow:

> Remoteness in time has, in itself, no more significance than remoteness in space. Suppose that I shoot some arrow into a distant wood, where it wounds some person. If I should have known that there might be someone in this wood, I am guilty of gross negligence. Because this person is far away, I cannot identify the person whom I harm. But this is no excuse. Nor is it any excuse that this person is far away. We should make the same claims about effects on people who are temporally remote.[Parfit (1987), in @krznaric-2021-good p.81]

These temporally remote bodies are the bodies under real pressure: the bodies and lives of the future. They are out of sight and out of mind, and their futures are being colonized by our rapacious present. The Paleontologist Tim Flannery describes our human species as “the future eaters”.[in @krznaric-2021-good p.141]

None of this is surprising particularly given just how seductive is the logic of instrumentalization. The writer Oliver Burkeman describes the global economy as a "giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters -- the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”) -- in the service of future profit." [@burkeman-2021-four n.pag.]

The blooming of practice-research as part of the professionalisation of the arts in Western academies over the last 30 years means that artistic research is profoundly caught in this web of instrumentalisation. Practice-research predicated on short-term instrumentalization creates bodies in the service of hidden fires; the body as yet another resource to be consumed; the body as a technology - "as a tool for assuaging my own anxiety".[@burkeman-2021-four n.pag] To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More published. More awarded. More progressed. More promoted. These are bodies under stress that exhaust resources and colonise the future. These are bodies living in the short-term me-future. 

I, I, I. Me, me, me. My, my, my.

And under such conditions of stress, strain, and pressure, if we fall or collapse into the various and shiny short-term futures that are always pulling us, cajoling us, haunting us, then I think we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as it is, and as a means to be a good ancestor. The body de-instrumentalised is radically in the present of awareness, and is not judged or massaged for other short-term future means. This is a body filled with the humility of its insignificance, while profoundly aware of bodies yet to be.

The question then that each of us must ask and understand deeply -- and then ask again, and understand differently -- is, what is the fundamental purpose of one's practice? That to start to understand a practice's purpose is to start to enter deeply into what sociologist Andrew Pickering so memorably described as "the mangle of practice"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.1] 

And if your practice is body-based then the question becomes more specific: What is the fundamental purpose of this body in this practice?

Perhaps only then might we continue to understand and be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else, including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, and measured. These are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies to be swiped or scrolled. These are radically analogue bodies deep in non-judgmental awareness that are meeting and sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.

### Two descriptions

I'd like to describe two art ideas -- one imagined, the other started -- that attempt to consider the body beyond its lifetime, and harness humility and responsibility, while not being built on hidden fire. Both are inspired by art works like Katie Paterson's _Future Library_ (2014) or Danny Hillis's _Clock of the Long Now_ (1999), or Walter de Maria's _The Lightning Field_ (1977) or Juha van Ingen's animated gif called _AS Long As Possible (ASLAP)_ (2015) or Jem Finer's _LongPlayer_ (2000). Yet, in describing these two art ideas I understand profoundly that, as Andri Magnason wrote, "nothing is as magnificent as a glacier, nothing so mysterious as a rainforest at night."[@magnason-2021-time pp.259-260]

They are descriptions of practices or activities that are defined by not being able to be completed; their ontology is to be ongoing. They are "artworks as processes or the seeds for processes -- things that exist and change in time, things that are never finished".[@eno-2000-big n.pag.] They stretch into time beyond those we love and who love us. They are an attempt to shift our attention from something extrinsic to our practices to something intrinsic to them. They are an attempt to generate signal without generating noise. They are so-called _atelic activities_ meaning their value is not derived from their telos or aim[@burkeman-2021-four] because, after all, how might I even begin to contemplate their affects (or lack of affect) when they continue long after I am gone? 

There is a haiku by the Japanese poet and Buddhist priest Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828). I first heard it quite recently when the poet Jane Hirshfield read it:

> In this world  
we walk on the roof of hell  
gathering blossoms.

It provided a fatally obvious link between simple physical practices that acknowledge the hidden fires. These two descriptions that follow express a desire to make things that extend into the future that are most certainly not about legacy. But rather, about those people in the future, those yet to be. That they (in the future) might know that we thought about them. We paid them attention, even as human corporations continued to suck fossil fuels out of the ground. 

#### Description 1: Custodians (imagined)

Perhaps you know of the Shinto shrine in Japan called Ise Jingū that has been torn down and rebuilt to the same design every 20 years for more than 1300 years. It is described as a "building forever new and forever ancient."[@krznaric-2021-good p.96]

Perhaps you've also thought about how cities are more than just tangible solid things that last for hundreds or thousands of years; and that "in human terms they are never stable"[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] with people constantly arriving and leaving. Rather, according to Graeber and Wengrow, a city is a place that is thought of -- or imagined to be -- a city because we humans "think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or Muscovites or Calcuttans."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 

These two things -- one an ancient re-building in Japan, the other a way of understanding the city as an imagined structure spawned a simple idea. What kind of fluid infrastructure -- or score -- could be created that mirrored these ideas? What kind of framework to be replaced or rebuilt every, say, 10 years? That through its cyclical destruction and reconstruction it might gather resilience and motility -- the capacity to absorb pressure, be ready for unseen and unknown stressors, and to be flexible. What if this _infrastructure_ were predicated on a literal and metaphorical body unable to be owned, a public body. What if one dance were to be performed at the same time in a specified place each year? That one body, one person, were responsible for making this dance happen every year, for 10 years. To be a custodian of that dance for 10 years. What if, at that point, another custodian took over and rebuilt the same infrastructure and acted as a steward for another 10 years? One dance for the long now, with or without an audience. The smallest of footprints. How would this body be named?    

#### Description 2: This body (started)

This is the simplest of ideas that attempts to express how each of us is a humble steward for our bodies. Whenever I meet or see someone, I've been asking them a simple question. _What is your body to you?_ I then ask them to respond by starting with the words "This body" (or however that may be translated into their mother tongue).

I would love for you to email yours to me -- se@skellis.net -- in whichever language you choose. This would be a treasured gift and it would honour the work that I'm slowly starting to realise is my life. It's strange how a life sneaks up on you. Being young is most definitely poor practice for becoming old.

I like to imagine having a physical location to collect all these instances of _this body_, perhaps like the sociologist Niklas Luhmann's zettelkasten or slipboxes. Like the analogue library catalogues I remember from my youth. Each instance of _This body_ would be a removable card: something to be held, to be touched, reflected on. Something that long after my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig is dead, some time after 2106, would not require any hidden fires to sustain it, but just a little bit of space in someone's home. People could visit it, photograph it, steal from it, add to it. Perhaps such a simple thing might be a way to become a good ancestor while paying attention to the smallness and profound humility of the human body.  

Here is a sample of what I have collected so far.  

This body is aging.
This body makes things possible.
This body is constantly reinventing itself. 
This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies. 
This body knows how to walk, run and dance.
This body is not like the others.
This body feels.
This body is wounded. 
This body sees and is seen.
This body is a chameleon. 
This body has buried the bodies of others. 
This body adapts.
This body has been exploited. 
This body cannot be known.
This body will die.
This body is no longer the same. 
This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard". 
This body is at a loss.
This body is enveloped by skin.
This body houses these feelings. 
This body is consciousness and self-knowing. 
This body cannot escape technology.
This body is unknown and cannot be known.
This body is bleeding.
This body has bled.
This body is technological.
This body is broken.
This body is a time-traveler.
This body is overwhelmed by detail. 
This body is the place through which experiences flood.
This body is where I need to go.
This body belongs to this mind.
This body trusts you.
This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory.
This body is in pain.
This body has no boundary.
This body has betrayed me. 
This body is worthy of trust. 
This body is mine.
This body is always reinventing itself.
This body is not far from death and I am not afraid.
This body humbles me over and over again.
This body takes pleasure.
This body plays.
This body is untouchable.

One final thing. I use a document version control system called Git and as such most of current writing and work is openly accessible under a Creative Commons license at Github. This means that the entire history of this presentation -- every edit, every mistake, every tangent -- is able to be viewed via what is called the document's _blame_ file at https://bit.ly/ellis-pressure. Terrifying, but who would not want a blame file?

I'd like to acknowledge an enormous debt of gratitude to Roman Krznaric, David Graeber and David Wengrow, Oliver Burkeman and Andris Snær Magnason -- the authors of _The Good Ancestor_, _The Dawn of Everything_, _Four Thousand Weeks_ and _On Time and Water_. Their work underpins so many of the ideas presented here, and I have mercilessly adopted and adapted their ideas without their permission. At the same time, they also just happened to be the books I was reading when I was asked to build this presentation. 

Thank you. And thank you once again for being given this tremendous honour to present these ideas to you this morning. It has been a pleasure and this body is most certainly humbled.
