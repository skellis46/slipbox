# pressure, stress and strain - the body in time in practice as research

{**.self**}

## self-introduction: I am a body

My name is Simon Ellis and I have a body, and this body is not just a head and shoulders. 

{**OPEN firefox: 'body.gif**}

{**.cat**}

That word _have_ in "I have a body" is strange. Like a possession.  As in: I have a car or I have a cat. If I were to say "I _am_ a body" then, in English at least, it seems to diminish my agency or identity, as if I am _only_ a body. How would that idea translate into your mother tongue? 

So in English when we say "I have a body" it's hard to shake this sense of it being something external that we have possession of. {**.ad**} The neurobiologist Antonio Damasio simply states that consciousness itself is the recognition that feelings and sensations are assumed to belong to the body each of us identifies as mine.[@damasio-2021-feeling] {**.doe**} In their 2021 book _The Dawn of Everything_, anthropologist David Graeber and archeologist David Wengrow describe the sacred quality of private property in historical European social thought, and how this sacred quality extends to ownership of our own bodies as a kind of human right.

In saying all this -- in this rather strange introduction -- you might have guessed that I am a dancer, and to state the obvious, this means I am interested in the body and bodies. Graeber and Wengrow describe "extremely human activities" like "gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag] I love that dancing is up there with gossip and arguing as an extremely human activity. 

I make dance performances and films and I've been doing this for about 30 years. They have all been tiny. Insignificant. Perhaps this is where human beings are most equal: in our complete cosmic insignificance. You might even say these performances I made were microscopic. Well, that's not true, all were able to be seen with the naked eye although I like the idea of making literally microscopic dances. These choreographies reveal how my interests have changed through time. 

{**.prev**}

You might even say -- if you were being unkind -- that these choreographies were all really just about me. {**.jon**} The health and mindfulness specialist Jon Kabat-Zinn describes how, in meditation (and in life) even the _not me story_ is the _story of me_. It's fine, by the way, if you'd like to be unkind. 

What follows this morning is a guided -- or maybe misguided -- tour of the body under pressure and in time. At its heart are the things each of us makes, and for whom -- and for when -- they are made. 

{**.bri**}

## a brief aside

{**.yud**} There's an Artificial Intelligence theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky who is best known for creating the term "friendly artificial intelligence." In his blogging days he used to include what he called _meditations_ or "puzzles" for readers to think through.[@yudkowsky-2012-useful n.p.] I'm going to steal Yudkowsky's idea but with two different purposes in mind. The first is to recognise that time in this online space -- a webinar -- is experienced as a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances and limits; and to acknowledge that how I choreograph this space-time makes a difference to how you experience it. The second is to provoke specific reflections from you. Each meditation will last 1 minute, and each will give you the viewer a chance to reflect, note or drift as you prefer. I imagine some of you might even flick over to check your email -- maybe something important has arrived. You. Never. Know.

## understanding practice-research

At a certain point -- just over 20 years ago -- I started to integrate ideas about research into my dancing. Here's a brief and rather curious list. 

{**.pizza**}

- Science research  
- Pizza research 
- Music research 
- Dance research  

When we attach the word 'research' to anything it implies a desire to find out or understand something differently. If I say to a friend that I need to do some research before choosing a pizzeria tonight they'd understand that there's a decision to be made, and that without the _research_ we might not get to eat the best pizza. 

But what about this? 

{**.about**}

- research about science 
- research about pizza  
- research about music  
- research about dance  

The word _about_ tells us the object of the research, but not how that research might happen. For example, research _about_ music might be something relatively informal or trivial like a web search to find the latest release from a particular artist. But research _about_ music also might use formal historical methods (within the traditions or conventions that historians use) to understand a piece of music differently. In the same way, research _about_ dance might use anthropology, history, sociology, or science (etc) as methods to increase human understanding of dance. 

And this?

{**EDIT the list in sublime text**}

- research through science  
- research through pizza  
- research through music  
- research through dance  

When we research _through_ something a method is already implied, but the object is not. Research through science uses the scientific method to explore a phenomenon. Research through dance uses the practices of dance in order to explore ideas, phenomena, etc. In both cases, what is able to be examined, what is understood, and how understanding is presented (or made accessible) is in no small part determined by the methods used. 

This is what practice-as-research is. It is when we investigate ideas through artistic practices. It is not necessarily _about_ those practices (although it often is), but it is most definitely through those practices. 

{**.jum**}

## jump cut to talk about pressure, stress and strain ... and neoliberalism

I have a friend who is an exercise physiologist. His name is Jim, Jim Cotter. Here he is. {**'jim.jpg**} Not so long ago he and I were in a car together and I asked Jim if he was stressed. He smiled because his first thought was to think of stress the way physical scientists or engineers think about the term. It goes something like this:

Stress is "generated whenever a force is applied on a body to deform it".[@deyin-nodate-pressure n.pag.] Stress occurs inside a material body. 

Pressure, then, is the "intensity of external forces acting at a point." Pressure is exerted on the body.[@deyin-nodate-pressure n.pag.]

Jim also used another word: strain.

Strain is how stress is measured in the physical sciences, and is a material property of a body's change in shape. It refers to the "amount of deformation experienced by the body".[@noauthor-nodate-stress] Think of how a flexible or malleable body responds to pressure -- an external force -- differently from a rigid body. Not better or worse, just differently. 

{**'hamster.mp4**}

In psychology, stress is the feeling we get when we perceive pressure from internal or external conditions as being beyond our ability to cope. In both understandings of stress, there is a point beyond which we -- our bodies, or the material bodies in question -- cannot cope. There is some quantity of psychological or physical deformation beyond which we -- or systems, or bodies -- break. We cannot continue deforming. 

In the arts and humanities in the UK, when we talk about pressure, stress and strain at work, we often pair those experiences or feelings with the word neoliberalism. In some way, neoliberalism generates pressure that causes stress that -- in time or at times -- we feel unable to cope with. That we are being deformed by neoliberalism. 

The everyday version of neoliberalism underpins unregulated hyper-individualism, ill-conceived faith in the meritocracy,[@sandel-2020-tyranny] loneliness, and the commodification of behaviour and thought.[see for instance, @zuboff-2019-age] Neoliberalism drives the idea that each of us is solely responsible for continual production. The pressure to produce without careful consideration of the physical, temporal, material and psychological resources available both now and in the future is disastrous. This. Now this. Now this. _This_ is a body under pressure. 

Each of us -- as academics, as artists, as teachers, as human beings -- will have felt these demands in various volumes and ways. But the worst part is that "short-termism is built into the genetic code of the neoliberal paradigm."[@krznaric-2021-good p.196]

## zoom in: presence, body-based practices and now

{**.+be**}

### being present

In dance and performance practices -- both in and outside of the University -- what do we choreographers and artists do? We make art and performances. I'd like to propose one thing all dance (perhaps even all performance including theatre and opera) has in common -- from social dancing, to artistic dancing -- is a concern for, pleasure in, and deep curiosity about something called many things, but most often _presence_. That _being present_ is an essential part of dancing -- perhaps even an essential part of being human -- and somehow not being present is a bad thing, or something to be avoided. Being present is the opposite of blanking while performing; or being so self-conscious -- or perhaps hyper-judgmental -- while out social dancing that your body refuses to move, or you refuse to move it. 

{**'wedding.mp4**}

{**.kate**}

And if you were to quietly agree with me, at least for a moment, that being present -- whatever that really is -- seems important, then it is more than a little odd that most products or things we make -- including performances -- can be summed up by what the economist Kate Raworth describes as "take, make, use, lose."[Raworth, in @krznaric-2021-good p.206] In other words, we take the Earth's materials, make them into things we want or like, use them a bit (or present them), and then they are discarded or lost. 

I think you can entertain or imagine the tension or contradiction between such a mode of production, and a set of artistic practices predicated on presence. It's a strange formula:

{**.form**}

Take. Make. Use. Lose. Oh, and yeah, be present. 

{**.+now**}

### now: process-oriented body-based artistic practices

The linear model of production in dance and performance is unsustainable. The feeling of running to stand still is getting stronger. 

Under these conditions of production, I've become increasingly curious about process-oriented body-based practices. By these I mean things like somatics that distinguish the body as observed from the outside versus the soma as perceived from the inside. These are practices known by names like Feldenkrais, Alexander technique and Skinner Releasing Technique. 

The distinction I've just stated between inner and outer worlds, between what can be seen and what can only be felt, is an important one. It is perhaps even _radical_ given our oculocentric TikToking world, and that body-based practices like somatics seem to resist so many of the tropes of the body under pressure: pressure to take, pressure to make, pressure to use, pressure to lose. The pressures of production.

Another somatic practice commonly used in dance is the oddly named Authentic Movement. Authentic Movement was developed as a therapy, but it is also used by dance and movement artists as a way to tune the body's senses, and less commonly as choreographic process and performance.[e.g. @mcleod-2016-movement] There are two roles; the first is the mover who has their eyes closed. This person moves in direct response to what they are experiencing, remembering, feeling, sensing or imagining. Their task or activity is to be awake to the "full universe of sensations associated with the body being itself,"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon n.pag] and to cultivate awareness without judgement. The other person keeps the mover physically safe, and simply observes them without judgement. They change roles. Two people, one observing their inner world and moving, the other observing the other person in the outer world. 

{**'currency.jpg**}

What is profound about Authentic Movement is the simple-in-theory attempt to practice internal and external observation without judgement. How often in our lives -- other than when we were very small children -- do we get to move, play and be without judgment? For adults it's difficult to imagine what lies outside of judgement. 

It might already seem quite clear to you that Authentic Movement is really a contemplative practice like mindfulness; a set of processes in which we practice "the timeless present we call now";[Kabat-Zinn in @mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon n.pag.] where we breathe and move out of clock time and into non-judgemental awareness. 

But so what?

I want to propose that such practices remind us that there is an opportunity -- regardless of our roles as artists, or teachers or researchers -- to seek methods of doing what we do that distill production from consumption. That rather than making something simply to be seen (or consumed in some other way), we interrogate our responsibilities as practitioners and seek to de-instrumentalize processes of making in order to understand more slowly and deeply their purpose; to consider deeply that to understand their purpose (including the possibility that they have no purpose) is one's only task. That as soon as we cease "holding the whole body in awareness"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon] we jolt into the unwieldy self-consciousness of instrumental production: I do this in order to get this sometime in the near future. These are our bodies that gravitate towards wondering what something might bring us. The consequences of this gravitational pull towards I, me and my are devastating. They are devastating not only because of the profound internal and external stressors created by short-term production, but because they lead us to turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] 

{**.+2now**}

### a brief excursion into another type of now

I want to briefly note that there is another type of now that is different in kind from what I've just been describing as presence based on non-judgemental awareness. {**'bateson.jpg**} It is summed up by the cultural anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson as follows:

{**.irony**}

> "the great irony of our time is that even as we are living longer, we are thinking shorter.” This is the age of the tyranny of the now.[Bateson, in @krznaric-2021-good pp.4-5]

{**.bor**}

The _sine qua non_ contemporary mode of such tyranny is doom-scrolling. The philosopher of technology Albert Borgmann -- building on the thinking and writing of the Trappist monk Thomas Merton -- describes technologically induced distraction as a "permanent, if attractively glamorous, fog".[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.8]

Distraction under these everyday conditions is time unfelt as it is smothered or erased by streams of algorithmically delivered images. It is a feeling of being _lost in now_ closely related to neoliberally induced hyper-productive busyness, and is the precise opposite of the timeless quality of now experienced by re-membering the body in non-judgemental awareness. I see this as a kind of paradox of time, or perhaps paradox of now. One version of _now_ voids the past, present and future. The other harnesses the present to expand our understanding, experience and imagination of the past and the future. 

And it is to the future that I now turn.

{**.zout**}

## zoom out: artistic practices for the future

{**.+t**}

### being out of touch

What became clear, even in the earliest days of the pandemic, was that touching others -- making physical contact with others -- was under direct and immediate pressure to change. We went from people who touch each other all of the time (in different circumstances, conventions and situations) to a species that avoided touch. We became out of touch. Touch was dangerous. Touch was contagious.

To be _out of touch_ in English means of course to be disconnected or out of date, as if we have no remaining touch left. During the pandemic, I reflected on the possibility that all of this work -- and in particular all of _my_ work -- was out of touch. 

This had nothing at all to do with the pandemic and everything to do with fire. 

{**.mag**} 

In _On Time and Water_ Andri Magnason reminds us of the 1700s in Scotland when James Watt gifted humankind the steam engine. 

Magnason describes it like this:

{**.watt**}

> Watt allowed us to tame fire; gradually we learned to hide the flames better, isolating the heat, smoke and soot until fire has become invisible under the glossy hoods of air-conditioned cars that go cruising around the world with their upholstered seats and pumping music.[@magnason-2021-time p.191]

This is how we humans are really out of touch: the mechanisms by which we burn resources are powerfully hidden from view. These invisible fires have fueled, and continue to fuel, what is now commonly -- but not officially in the geologic time scale -- referred to as the anthropocene.

I seem to have created a terrible mess here. 

{**manually minimise images**}

How to knit together these various things I've placed on this shared desktop? I am trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, hungry human body in a way that each of us might find useful. This is not some abstract, hypothetical game with no consequences. Pressure. Stress. Strain. Time. If I start to take into account the time beyond one's own lifetime, individualism, now-ness, personal ambition, and most pressing of all the climate emergency, I start to wonder, what might a body-based practice be in the long now? In deep time? 

{**.+ga**}

### the game of people you have loved and who will love you

There's a simple game to play. The game is to measure the span of time of people you have loved and who will love you.[@magnason-2021-time p.308]

My grandmother, Gladys Hopkins, was born in 1913. Here she is singing. {**'gladys.mp4**} Gladys gave birth to my mother, Gabrielle Eastwood, in 1937. Here she is in 1960. {**'gabrielle.jpg**} I was born in 1968, and here I am in about 1971.{**'glasses.jpg**} My niece Rebecca was born in 1980; and Rebecca's daughter -- my great niece -- Zoe Ellis-Craig was born in 2016.{**'zoebex.jpg**} If we imagine that Zoe lives until she is 90 then this would mean she would die in 2106. 

From 1913 to 2106 is 193 years of people I have loved and who have loved me. 193 years. This small, insignificant, delicate body extended through time, and "beyond the ego boundary of [my] own mortality".[@krznaric-2021-good pp.14-15] This body's hopes, dreams, traumas, desires, and limitations; its 206 discrete bones, 650 or so muscles, and 100 billion neurons. This a body that counts. These are the bodies that count. 

{**.+an**}

### to be a good ancestor

{**.rom**}

In this next part I'm going to draw heavily on the writing of Roman Krznaric, who describes himself as a "public philosopher." In particular, I'm using some of the ideas he presents in his book _The Good Ancestor_ (2021), and I want to acknowledge just how inspiring that writing has been for me. 

{**.salk**}

Krznaric writes about Jonas Salk. Salk was an American virologist most famous for one thing: the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s. Salk refused to patent the vaccine so it would be a gift to humanity, and he also said that the most important question we must ask ourselves is this:

{**ONE space LEFT**}

"Are we being good ancestors?"

I love this question. It is haunting, and for me it operates on two profound levels. The first is that it engenders a strong sense of what Krznaric describes as "deep-time humility"[@krznaric-2021-good p.39] in which our radical insignificance as organisms is underlined. The second is about responsibility towards the bodies and lives of the future. These temporally remote bodies are the bodies under real pressure. They are out of sight and out of mind, and their futures are being colonized by our rapacious present. We are, according to the Paleontologist Tim Flannery, “the future eaters”.[in @krznaric-2021-good p.141]

{**.ver**}

None of this is surprising particularly given just how seductive is the logic of instrumentalization. The writer Oliver Burkeman describes the global economy as a "giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters -- the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”) -- in the service of future profit." [@burkeman-2021-four n.pag.]

The blooming of practice-research as part of the professionalisation of the arts in Western academies over the last 30 years means that artistic research is profoundly caught in this web of instrumentalisation. Practice-research predicated on short-term instrumentalization creates bodies in the service of hidden fires; the body as yet another resource to be consumed; the body as a technology. To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More published. More awarded. More promoted. These are bodies under stress that exhaust resources and colonise the future. These are bodies living in the short-term me-future. 

{**open photo booth**}

It's a future that sounds like I, I, I. Me, me, me. My, my, my.

And under such conditions of stress, strain, and pressure, if we collapse into the various and shiny short-term futures that are always pulling us, cajoling us, haunting us, then I think we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as it is, and the body as a means to be a good ancestor. The body de-instrumentalised is radically in the present of awareness, and is not judged or massaged for other short-term future means. This is a body filled with the humility and dignity of its insignificance, while profoundly aware of bodies yet to be.

The question then that each of us must ask and understand deeply -- and then ask again, and understand differently -- is, what is the fundamental purpose of one's practice? 

And if your practice is body-based then the question becomes more specific: What is the fundamental purpose of this body in this practice?

Perhaps only then might we continue to understand and be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else, including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, and measured. These are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies to be swiped or scrolled. These are radically analogue bodies deep in non-judgmental awareness that are meeting and sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.

{**.two**}

## two descriptions

I'd like to describe two art project ideas -- one imagined, the other started -- that attempt to consider the body beyond its lifetime, and harness humility and responsibility, while not being built on hidden fires. {**.fut**} Both are inspired by art works like Katie Paterson's _Future Library_ (2014) or Danny Hillis's _Clock of the Long Now_ (1999), or Walter de Maria's _The Lightning Field_ (1977). They are descriptions of practices or activities that are defined by not being able to be completed. They stretch into time beyond those we love and who love us. 

{**issa.jpg**}

There is a haiku by the Japanese poet and Buddhist priest Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828). I include it here because some 300 years later it places side by side a simple physical practice that happens to acknowledge the hidden fires that sustain our unsustainable way of life. 

{**.hai**}

> In this world  
we walk on the roof of hell  
gathering blossoms.

{**.+cus**}

### description 1: custodians (imagined)

{**.inn**}

Perhaps you know of the Shinto shrine in Japan called Ise Jingū in which the inner and outer shrines have been torn down and rebuilt to the same design every 20 years for more than 1300 years. It is described as a "building forever new and forever ancient."[@krznaric-2021-good p.96]

Perhaps you've also thought about how cities are more than just fixed things that last for centuries; and that "in human terms they are never stable"[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] with people constantly arriving and leaving. According to Graeber and Wengrow a city is a place that is thought of -- or imagined to be -- a city because we humans "think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or [...] Calcuttans" or Melbournians.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 

These two things -- one an ancient re-building in Japan, the other a way of understanding the city as an imagined structure -- generated a simple idea for me. What kind of score could be created that mirrored these things? What kind of framework to be replaced or rebuilt every, say, 10 years? That through its cyclical destruction and reconstruction it might gather resilience and motility -- the capacity to absorb pressure, be ready for unseen and unknown stressors, and to be flexible. What if this _infrastructure_ were predicated on a literal and metaphorical body unable to be owned, a public body. What if one dance were to be performed at the same time in a specified place each year? That one body, one person, were responsible for organising this dance every year, for 10 years. To be a custodian of that dance for 10 years. What if, at that point, another custodian took over and rebuilt the same infrastructure and acted as a steward for another 10 years? And so on. One dance for the long now, with or without an audience. The smallest of footprints. How would this body be named?

{**+.bo**}

### description 2: this body (started)

This is the simplest of ideas that attempts to express how each of us is a humble steward for our bodies. Whenever I meet or see someone, I've been asking them a simple question. _What is your body to you?_ I then ask them to respond by starting with the words "This body". 

---

{**.med3**}

_Meditation:_ What is your body to you? ("This body ...")

{**timer.mp4**}

---


I would love for you to email yours to me in whichever language you choose. This would be a treasured gift and it would honour the work that I'm slowly starting to realise is my life. It's strange how a life sneaks up on you. Being young is most definitely poor practice for becoming old.

{**.zet**} 

I like to imagine having a physical location to collect all these instances of _this body_. Perhaps like the sociologist Niklas Luhmann's zettelkasten. Each instance of _This body_ would be a removable card: something to be held, to be touched, reflected on. Something that would not require any hidden fires to sustain it, but just a little bit of space in someone's home. People could visit it, photograph it, steal from it, add to it. Perhaps such a simple thing might be a way to become a good ancestor while paying attention to the smallness and profound humility of the human body.  

Here's Zoe Ellis-Craig to dance for you.

{**'zoe-ellis-craig.mp4**}

And here is a sample of what I have collected so far. 

{**TWO spaces RIGHT**]

This body is aging.
This body makes things possible.
This body is constantly reinventing itself. 
This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies. 
This body knows how to walk, run and dance.
This body is not like the others.
This body feels.
This body grows.
This body changes.
This body is wounded.
This body is bruised. 
This body sees and is seen.
This body is a chameleon. 
This body has buried the bodies of others. 
This body adapts.
This body has been exploited. 
This body cannot be known.
This body will die.
This body touches the earth.
This body has a birthmark.
This body is no longer the same. 
This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard". 
This body is at a loss.
This body is enveloped by skin.
This body houses these feelings. 
This body is consciousness and self-knowing. 
This body cannot escape technology.
This body is unknown and cannot be known.
This body is bleeding.
This body has bled.
This body marks the planet.
This body is technological.
This body is broken.
This body is a time-traveler.
This body is overwhelmed by detail. 
This body is the place through which experiences flood.
This body is where I need to go.
This body belongs to this mind.
This body trusts you.
This body consumes resources.
This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory.
This body is in pain.
This body has no boundary.
This body has betrayed me. 
This body is worthy of trust. 
This body is mine.
This body walks.
This body is always reinventing itself.
This body is not far from death and I am not afraid.
This body humbles me over and over again.
This body takes pleasure.
This body plays.
This body is untouchable.



## unused meditations

This is the body that takes the time it needs to take. I think this is body based PaR. A body under consideration that takes the time it needs to take. 

Q (for meditation?): what is the role of "control" and "force" in such a body?

Meditation: what is the role of patience in your work and research? What (if anything) does it have to do with originality? 

Meditation: when to admit to not-knowing? That the territory is unattainable. That paradox lies at the heart of research.

Quality of the questioning. The questions lack precision. They are more like drag nets. Capturing all. What is the risk in the precision? To narrow attention. I don't have evidence of this. It's a feeling. Perhaps a proposition. 

- domestication -- requires human intervention (else it dies). opposite of this for PaR and the body. The danger of domestication. Keeping it wild. The lightest of touches. But also narrowing and being specific. (re questions).

I don't mean the usual research artists do into the subject of their work. For instance, if you were developing an artistic project about, say, climate change, then you'd do a whole lot of reading and background research into climate change. Your research would be a way for you to gather images, ideas, inspiration ... to become informed on the subject matter, while also stoking or loading your imagination. There are no parameters for how the research might happen.

The thing when you _are_ a body, and a body that performs, it's hard for choreographies not to be thought to be personal or about you (even if you don't want them to be). 

The Canadian political scientist C. B. Macpherson called this _possessive individualism_ in how we are thought to be the sole proprietors of our skills (and by extension our bodies), and how we owe nothing to society for them.[@little-2011-possessive]

One final thing. I use a document version control system called Git and as such most of my current writing and work is openly accessible under a Creative Commons license at Github. This means that the entire history of this presentation -- every edit, every mistake, every tangent -- is able to be viewed via what is called the document's _blame_ file: https://bit.ly/ellis-pressure. Terrifying, but who would not want a blame file?

What might it be like to be "blinded" as Thomas Merton said by an "excess of clarity"?[@merton-1954-elected p.30]



I am talking through all of this background in somatics because I understand the concept of presence in the performing arts to be _non-judgemental awareness_. It's the keystone of dancing, and perhaps all of the performing arts; it's akin to Csikszentmihalyi's famous idea _flow_[@csikszentmihalyi-2009-flow] in which concepts of self seem to fall away; that the language and sense of I, I, I, me, me, me, my, my, my, is rendered obsolete, or has no place in non-judgemental awareness. 

Curiously, the Pali term _sati_ was first translated into English as _mindfulness_ in 1881 by English scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids. Sati means memory or to remember and this sense of remembering is lost in the English translation _mindfulness_. The meditation practitioner Sebene Selassie writes of the importance of remembering in contemplative practices -- of coming back to the body (she calls this _bodyfulness_), or re-membering the body:

>to dismember means to pull the body apart piece by piece ... Maybe we are re–membering. [...] coming to our senses, cultivating an embodied awareness ... putting our bodies back together.[@selassie_getting_nodate n.d.; n.p.]

If I push a bit further and consider body-based practices within the context of practice-research, then such practices become vital and difficult for five reasons: 

1. Body-based practices have a complex and often fraught relationship with language. That is, how does descriptive or analytical language function with these practices? 
2. Their experiential nuances are felt, and not seen. 
3. Body-based practices intersect with contested issues of embodied knowledge and tacit awareness. That is, when doing these practices, how might we recognise what is understood or known by the practitioners and how that understanding changes through time? 
4. These practices complicate decades-old problems in artistic research to do with practices that are ephemeral and how they might be documented. 
5. Finally, body-based practices ask us to slow down. They introduce "slack time"[@munger-2021-it n.pag], a chance to adjust ourselves to different experiences of the unfolding of time. 

and I've done this for four reasons: i) my aging body -- it is physically capable of less. This is also called _making a virtue out of necessity_; ii) each choreography, each performance seems to take longer to make (and uses more resources), but is seen or presented fewer times; iii) a deeper focus on research through practice; and iv) the desire to seek practices that don't fit or make sense in current models of production.  



These two descriptions that follow express a desire to make things that extend into the future that are most certainly not about legacy. But rather, about those people in the future, those yet to be. That they (in the future) might know that we thought about them. We paid them attention, even as human corporations continued to suck fossil fuels out of the ground. 

They are an attempt to shift our attention from something extrinsic to our practices to something intrinsic to them. 

They are descriptions of practices or activities that are defined by not being able to be completed; their ontology is to be ongoing. They are "artworks as processes or the seeds for processes -- things that exist and change in time, things that are never finished".[@eno-2000-big n.pag.] They stretch into time beyond those we love and who love us. They are an attempt to shift our attention from something extrinsic to our practices to something intrinsic to them. They are _atelic activities_ meaning their value is not derived from their telos or aim[.@burkeman-2021-four]

That to start to understand a practice's purpose is to start to enter deeply into what sociologist Andrew Pickering so memorably described as "the mangle of practice"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.1] 

Yet during this pandemic we have all felt the pressure to stay connected or be in touch. We experienced -- and likely still experience -- zoom fatigue. A kind of hyper-connectivity made possible by 21st century digital technologies. We were desperate to stay in touch while knowing deep down in our zoom-fatigued bodies that we also remained profoundly out of touch. 

We avoided touch to protect ourselves and to protect others. For some, this was a kind of relief from social awkwardness; for others not at all. 

I see Authentic Movement as a body-based process that involves empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation, and although it is simple to describe, it generates complex psycho-physical experiences. The distinction between inner and outer worlds makes apparent that what we can observe bears little or no relationship to the experiential complexity of what happened. 

In fact, somatics practitioners are so enamoured with slowness that they use the Weber-Fechner Law to justify working at slow and deliberate speeds.[e.g. Shusterman, in @ginot-2010-shusterman] The Weber-Fechner Law describes the relationship between the actual change in a stimuli and the perceived change. For example, if a stimulus has an initial value of 1 arbitrary unit, and is increased by 10, our perception of this change will be very different if, for example the initial value is 400 and is increased to 410. In other words, if we slow the body right down, then our sensitivity to the same _quantity_ of change is heightened.

They express ideas, they captivate, they alienate, they distract, they are didactic, they are open to interpretation. In dance -- or at least in so much of dance -- they are people moving (sometimes to music, sometimes not). 
They are performances of enormously different scales. Sometimes they involve many many people, other times just a few (rarely just one, even when we call them "solos"). They are sometimes unpopular, sometimes popular. Sometimes they are under-developed, sometimes over-cooked, sometimes successful, sometimes not (however you might imagine 'success' to be gauged) 

Isn't it remarkable -- and beautiful -- that you are able to recognise these feelings in your body and recognise them as belonging to you? In this moment, this body that seems to be me -- or that I call _mine_ -- is sitting in front of a screen.  

There's another version of this game in which you imagine yourself to be that last person you know who will love you -- in this case my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig -- and write a letter to yourself as if you were the elderly version of that person. Might she describe me as a good ancestor? That these practices of performance, dance and film are in fact insignificant compared with how I stepped on the planet so that I might have been a good ancestor for Zoe Ellis-Craig? Will she judge my life as "laughable and foolish"[@magnason-2021-time p.259] or recognise how I squandered resource after resource making dances about myself? Will she recognise how even the _not me dances_ were really the _me dances_? 

, and here Krznaric cites the philosopher Derek Parfit's concept of the arrow:

> Remoteness in time has, in itself, no more significance than remoteness in space. Suppose that I shoot some arrow into a distant wood, where it wounds some person. If I should have known that there might be someone in this wood, I am guilty of gross negligence. Because this person is far away, I cannot identify the person whom I harm. But this is no excuse. Nor is it any excuse that this person is far away. We should make the same claims about effects on people who are temporally remote.[Parfit (1987), in @krznaric-2021-good p.81]


because, after all, how might I even begin to contemplate their affects (or lack of affect) when they continue long after I am gone? 

They are an attempt to generate signal without generating noise. 

Yet, in describing these two art ideas I understand profoundly that, as Andri Magnason wrote, "nothing is as magnificent as a glacier, nothing so mysterious as a rainforest at night."[@magnason-2021-time pp.259-260]

I'd also like to acknowledge Roman Krznaric, David Graeber and David Wengrow, Oliver Burkeman and Andris Snær Magnason -- the respective authors of _The Good Ancestor_, _The Dawn of Everything_, _Four Thousand Weeks_ and _On Time and Water_. Their work underpins so many of the ideas presented here, and I have mercilessly adopted and adapted their thinking without their permission. At the same time, they also just happened to be the books I was reading when I was asked to build this presentation. 

Good morning everyone. It is an honour and a pleasure to be here with you this morning. Actually, in the last two years it has become hard for me to even imagine what it's like to be _with_ other people; and it's not so accurate to say I am _with_ you. I'm not even with you on the same screen. Isn't it true that screens are now the principle means by which we humans are atomised? Perhaps we are on the same cloud-based server? I am honoured to be on the same web server as you this morning. Actually I suspect that's not right either. Perhaps all I can say is that I am honoured to be on Zoom at the same time as you. Let's go with that. 

It's absurd to attempt to characterise the set of global human artistic practices that might fall under the banner of 'dance' or 'performance' as I've just done. So forgive me my hubris. But 

-- although not nearly as culturally relevant as film or music

People in dance use the word 'body' like this quite a bit -- as in "I want to work with some bodies", as if these bodies are merely instruments or abstractions with which to choreograph space and time. 

> Cities are tangible things. Certain elements of their physical infrastructure – walls, roads, parks, sewers – might remain fixed for hundreds or even thousands of years; but in human terms they are never stable. People are constantly moving in and out of them, whether permanently, or seasonally for holidays and festivals, to visit relatives, trade, raid, tour around, and so on; or just in the course of their daily rounds. Yet cities have a life that transcends all this. This is not because of the permanence of stone or brick or adobe; neither is it because most people in a city actually meet one another. It is because they will often think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or Muscovites or Calcuttans.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 
- a practice more akin to a city? It is a thing that depends on certain characteristics. Hong Kong. geography, history, architecture. 

> In other words, from the perspective of someone living in an ancient city, the city itself was not so entirely different from earlier landscapes of clans or moieties that extended across hundreds of miles. It was a structure raised primarily in the human imagination, which allowed for the possibility of amicable relations with people they had never met.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]

- infrastructure of a shared body; a body unable to be owned, a public body. Or perhaps it's a name ... dance of the long now. _Custodians_. To do one dance a year at a specific time and place. How would this body be named? It does not even need an audience. 
- Flexibility, absorbing strain, lightness 
- infrastructure with the long now in mind. So different from the short now. 


- Of all my privileges, this one -- to be able to imagine futures beyond my current needs -- is one that seems vital to take advantage of.

> The particular mix depended largely on where in the world the cities happened to be, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that history’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]

Magnason describes it like this: 

> [This is the] time you can touch with your own hands. Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds you. And your time is also the time of the people you *will* know and love. The time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future every single day.’[@magnason-2021-time p.309]

Limitation. Narrow the attention. The resources. To touch the earth and our bodies on it lightly. But what do I mean by _scale of time?_

Seems like a nowness that is an [[obsession with generating noise]] - vs signal

Independence acts as a moral proxy for neoliberal faith in individualism and self-sufficiency; that each of us earns or does not earn our just deserts, and yet the more “we think of ourselves as self-made and self-sufﬁcient, the harder it is to learn gratitude and humility. And without these sentiments, it is hard to care for the common good.”[@sandel-2020-tyranny n.pag]

In _The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good?_ Michael Sandel unpicks Western democracies’ faith in meritocracy as a cornerstone of neoliberal and global consumer capitalism. He describes how the meritocratic ethic is “corrosive of commonality” in how it celebrates the morality of freedom and autonomy through markets that “give people what they deserve.”  For Sandel, meritocracy is not a solution to inequality but a way to justify it. 

The rationalisation of decisions, ideas, and progress based solely on market-led thinking is a core principle of neoliberalism: “a widespread shift towards the uninhibited private market as the primary source of human advancement.”[@verdouw-2017-subject p.524]

What I find interesting is that I see these scientific uses of the terms pressure, stress and strain as being abstractions. Yet, I suspect Jim, in that moment, saw clarity in them as a response to my abstract question: Are you stressed? 


Tell story about Jim. But these conceptualisations (try as I might) -- perhaps even abstractions -- have no place in this story this morning. Sorry Jim.
Placing these ideas on the table. They are a means by which to frame what will come. 

The massive cultural difference is that when we hear the word research, it pairs easily or conventionally with the word science. But conventions hide possibilities and ought not limit the ways in which humans seek understanding. 

Trigger warning: I'm going to use the word practice a lot in this presentation.

Conference Title: Harnessing a 21st Century Approach to Performing Arts: Technology Practice, Education & Research.

### Title

Pressure, stress and strain: the body in time in practice-as-research

### Abstract

This is a shared screen desktop performance that explores the body under stress, and the role that artistic research practices might play in helping us understand the temporal scale of our fleeting, fragile and rapacious human bodies. Where so many body-based practices are predicated on nuanced and refined encounters with presence or awareness, what might the purpose of the body be in artistic research practices that extend through time? My grandmother, the artist Gladys Eastwood (1913-2005), used to joke that, "If you are going to have delusions, you may as well have delusions of grandeur." Indeed, it is easy to measure, admire or fetishise the grandeur of the human body's possibilities. But what if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? What then for how we steward the body in motion and the body under duress?

### Biography

Simon Ellis is an artist working with research practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now lives in London. He grew up in a politicised family environment where they often talked about things like human dignity, consumerism and even technology. These, in turn, have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. Simon also thinks a lot about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and likes to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

In dance, we also often talk about 'training our instrument', meaning, training our bodies. Language is so telling or instructive isn't it? Wittgenstein famously wrote that "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." (Ludwig Wittgenstein’s “Tractatus Logico Philosophicus,” published in 1921) And just in case you imagine me to have spent time reading Wittgenstein, I actually read that quote in Brene Brown's latest book. I feel no shame over this.

Not to do this in order to ... that understanding its purpose (including the possibility it has no purpose) is one's only task. When shift from that you are serving something or someone else. Not because of what it might bring me, but because of the ideas themselves. No utility. It is the body "in the service of" that creates the pressure and stress. but humility??

of performing to be seen, and to do this in plain sight. I understand dance, and perhaps all of the performing arts, to be a small enough field -- and collection of practices -- to interrogate and resist the logic of production predicated on consumption. In contemporary dance we have talked about such resistance for years as a community but as dance has become more and more visible on social media and the "immediacy of appropriation"[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30], the temptation is to celebrate these days in the sun, and turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] 

These are high resolution experiences masked byThat is, we have high resolution experiences, and low resolution representations of those experiences, even as . The process gently asks us deeper into corporeal experiences that cannot be observed.

At the time, the word _mindfulness_ already existed in English; it was most definitely not a neologism. 

Perhaps it's not surprising that these kinds of practices like authentic movement seem to mirror mindfulness strategies (and growing industry of mindfulness in the West -- McMindfulness).  But also a way to cope. To cope with the pressure of neoliberalism. 

I think his concept of resolution is useful, even if I am robbing him of his thinking that was written for a particular context in a particular field. My digital theft of de Sousa Santos' thinking is to remind us that. And that gap applies irrespective of how fancy our technocratic solutions are to the problem of archiving movement and choreography.


In 2019 the dancer-choreographer Shaun McLeod and I worked together with the movement practice called Authentic Movement. What can be said about what happened in that space during those six weeks of practice? If all of us here had been there what would we all have heard and/or seen that we could agree on?

The mover moved around the space; sometimes this was more like a series of stillnesses, other times it was everyday: like walking or sitting. Still other times the mover might do things that were a little less everyday. These movements were sometimes strung together; most of us in this room would call that -- or recognise it as -- contemporary dance, or maybe somatically informed contemporary dance if we were being a bit fancy. But it was definitely not the kind of contemporary dance I've seen on "So You Think You Can Dance". [expand: so.mp4] I would say the mover looked a little like they were _feeling_ or _sensing_, maybe _looking inside_. But I couldn't be sure, and nor do I think we would agree on this.

It turns out that the smartphone was taking a photograph every 30 seconds, and the screen was darkened so the watcher wouldn't know when a photo was being taken nor how anything might be framed in the lens of the camera. 

One person -- the mover -- had their eyes closed. The other person -- the watcher -- was watching the mover. The watcher was also holding a smartphone _directed_ towards the mover, but was not paying attention to the phone's screen. A phone hyphen camera is not a regular part of Authentic Movement and you may or may not know that.

Here is a set of photos from one 20 minute Authentic Movement session with Shaun as the mover. These photos were taken at random without the watcher or  mover knowing when a photo was being taken, or how it was framed. [expand: 31shaun.jpg]]

This collection of photos is the visual remains of the practice. It is thirty-one photos, randomly framed, systematically taken and turned into a collection -- as if to seem complete. The strip is probably quite rich compared with how I've just verbally described what was happening in the studio. We can see the room, positions on the floor, clothing, the light, postures, hints of gestures, expressions. But an enormous quantity of experiential data have not made it from what was in the room to what you can see here. 

We can also infer some things from these photos, the most seductive being what kind of movement occurred. But we are _inferring_ movement, and by that I mean _implying_. We'd also be inferring understanding, and we would be inferring the presence or absence of this thing that gets called _embodied knowledge_. Even if these images were replaced by video ... still be inferring. It would still be

_Conditions for these proposals:_

- atelic
- intrinsic (not dependent on extrinsic resources -- care for externalities)
- body is present (why?)
- minimal footprint

Atelic: Presenting an action or event as being incomplete. (Is a hobby!) But there's a lie here isn't there? But in recognising the difference we are changed. Our bodies are changed. The pressures are changed. 

> We need more lithium today, and merely hope to find greater reserves—or a suitable replacement—tomorrow. This revaluation has the effect of shifting the place of the natural order from something intrinsic to our practices to something extrinsic. The whole of nature becomes what economists tellingly call an _externality_.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

> Taking a walk in the countryside, like listening to a favorite song or meeting friends for an evening of conversation, is thus a good example of what the philosopher Kieran Setiya calls an “atelic activity,” meaning that its value isn’t derived from its telos, or ultimate aim. You shouldn’t be aiming to get a walk “done”; nor are you likely to reach a point in life when you’ve accomplished all the walking you were aiming to do. “You can stop doing these things, and you eventually will, but you cannot complete them,” Setiya explains. They have “no outcome whose achievement exhausts them and therefore brings them to an end.” And so the only reason to do them is for themselves alone: “There is no more to going for a walk than what you are doing right now.” (4000 weeks)

Resist with all our hearts the instrumental and short-term future-focused way. That industrial practice-research will do this. Industrial performing arts will do this. In order to do or get this I must do this. It's living in the short-term me future. 

To de-instrumentalise the body. It's not a body FOR this or that thing. It is a body that is. It is a body under stress. Under pressure. It is not a body under pressure in order for something else to happen: justice, etc. 
A body radically in the present - not judged for another (short-term future) means. 


The purpose of this body, under these conditions is to be this body under these conditions. These are the practices -- the research practices -- in which we acknowledge and even resist the pressure to make it a body under these conditions instrumentalised to be another kind of body with other kinds of purposes. This is to write, understand and embody the body as it is.

> Admittedly, it’s not entirely our own fault that we approach our finite time in such a perversely instrumental and future-focused way. Powerful external pressures push us in this direction, too, because we exist inside an economic system that is instrumentalist to its core. One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit.

Whitman was right after all. We do contain multitudes. 

> Suzuki recognizes that seeing humans as interdependent with the living world lies at the heart of the seventh-generation principle. The environment is not something “out there”; as he puts it, “we are the environment.” We are connected to the landscape, just as we are to future generations, through the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil in which we grow our food.
> The oxygen we breathe in, for instance, circulates in our blood-stream and around half remains in our lungs, so there is no clear line separating where the air ends and we begin. When we exhale, our breath mixes with the air and is taken in by other people, birds, mammals, and reptiles. “If I am air and you are air, then I am you,” writes Suzuki. But the atoms in the air also persist through time. According to one study, there are 3 x 1019 (three followed by nineteen zeros) argon atoms in a breath of air. These quintillions of atoms are continually being blown around the planet, so wherever you are, you will breathe in around 15 argon atoms that you breathed in a year earlier. And that’s not all. Each breath we take contains argon atoms that were probably once inhaled by Cleopatra and Gautama Buddha, and will be breathed in by our descendants seven generations from today. “Air,” says Suzuki, plays an essential role “linking all life in a single matrix, and joining past, present and future in a single flowing entity.”32 [@krznaric-2021-good p.88]

> Is there an ideal time horizon to which we should aspire in the tug-of-war against short-termism? This book proposes a hundred years as a minimum threshold for long-term thinking.

So said Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine in 1953 but refused to patent it--forgoing profit so that more lives could be saved.

But when leading philosopher Roman Krznaric examines society today, he sees just the opposite: Our short term, exploitative mindsets have "colonized the future." (The Good Ancestor blurb)

> To recognize the close parallels between private property and notions of the sacred is also to recognize what is so historically odd about European social thought. Which is that – quite unlike free societies – we take this absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human rights and freedoms. This is what the political scientist C. B. Macpherson meant by ‘possessive individualism’. Just as every man’s home is his castle, so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the idea that you own your own body, just as you own your chattels and possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or house, or car, and so on.53 As we’ve seen, those who did not share this particular European conception of the sacred could indeed be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned – and, from Amazonia to Oceania, they often were. [@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag.]

- possessive individualism. Macpherson _Political Theory of Possessive Individualism_ (1962) (talks about negative rights versus positive rights, see footnote 53 in Graeber)

> One vivid example of how the capitalist pressure toward instrumentalizing your time saps meaning from life is the notorious case of corporate lawyers. 

>Seeing things this way helps explain the otherwise mysterious truth that rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable. They’re very good at instrumentalizing their time, for the purpose of generating wealth for themselves; that’s the definition of being successful in a capitalist world. But in focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness. And so their days are sapped of meaning, even as their bank balances increase. (4000 weeks)

They feel different. I can feel the difference now. Typing while on my bed. I am quite into this. Deep in thought, in reading. I am in the process of coming to understand what to present and how.

> "Because children grow up, we think a child’s purpose is to grow up,” Herzen says. “But a child’s purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn’t disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment…Life’s bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.” -- 4000 weeks. 

Like that Zizek who talked about checking out.

> [Heidegger's] answer is that our being is totally, utterly bound up with our finite time. So bound up, in fact, that the two are synonymous: to be, for a human, is above all to exist temporally, in the stretch between birth and death, certain that the end will come, yet unable to know when. We tend to speak about our having a limited amount of time. But it might make more sense, from Heidegger’s strange perspective, to say that we are a limited amount of time. That’s how completely our limited time defines us.[@burkeman-2021-four Chapter 3 Facing Finitude: Thrown into Time, n.pag.]

> Most of the products you will see—from socks to smartphones to cotton balls to deodorant—are made through an old-fashioned linear model of industrial design that Kate Raworth sums up as “take, make, use, lose.”  We take Earth’s materials, make them into things we want, use them for a while—sometimes only once—and then throw them away. And it is this linear degenerative economic model that pushes us over the brink of planetary boundaries.26 [@krznaric-2021-good p.206]

> Kirk explained that there are two ways to make a map: actual exploration to collect your own data, and using data provided by other people. Either way, maps are about layers. If you’re using existing data, you might start with elevation, then use a different set of data to layer on roads, then perhaps use hydrography data to find the lakes, streams, and rivers, and so on. He helped me understand that while different maps may use different layers, the one thing that all maps do is provide readers with orientation.[@brown-2021-atlas Introduction>You are here, n.pag.]
