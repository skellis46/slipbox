### Title

Pressure, stress and strain: the body in time in practice-as-research

### Abstract

This is a shared screen desktop performance that explores the body under stress, and the role that artistic research practices might play in helping us understand the temporal scale of our fleeting, fragile and rapacious human bodies. Where so many body-based practices are predicated on nuanced and refined encounters with presence or awareness, what might the purpose of the body be in artistic research practices that extend through time? My grandmother, the artist Gladys Eastwood (1913-2005), used to joke that, "If you are going to have delusions, you may as well have delusions of grandeur." Indeed, it is easy to measure, admire or fetishise the grandeur of the human body's possibilities. But what if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? What then for how we steward the body in motion and the body under duress?

### Biography

Simon Ellis is an artist working with research practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now lives in London. He grew up in a politicised family environment where they often talked about things like human dignity, consumerism and even technology. These, in turn, have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. Simon also thinks a lot about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and likes to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

## keynote

### self-introduction: I am a body

Good morning everyone. It is an honour and a pleasure to be here with you this morning. Well, not _with_ you, but ... among? Around? Next to? I'm certainly not on the same screen as you. Screens (personal) as atoms. Perhaps on the same cloud-based server? I am honoured to be on the same server as you this morning. Actually I suspect that's not right either. I am honoured to be on Zoom at the same time as you. Let's go with that. In the last two years it has become hard for me to even imagine what it's like to be _with_ other people.

My name is Simon Ellis and, just in case you are wondering ... I have a body, and this body is not just a head and shoulders. 

That word _have_ in "I have a body" is strange isn't it? Like a possession. Like: I have a car; I have a washing machine; or I have a cat. If I were to say "I am a body" then, in English at least, it seems to diminish my agency or identity, as if I am _only_ a body. How would that idea translate? Into Cantonese? Italian? Farsi? People in dance use the word 'body' like this quite a bit -- as in "I want to work with some bodies", as if these bodies are merely instruments with which to choreograph space and time. In dance, we also often talk about 'training our instrument', meaning, our bodies. Language is so telling or instructive isn't it? Wittgenstein famously wrote that "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." (read that in Brene Brown lest I sound too fancy).

In saying all this, you might have guessed that I am a dancer. Recently, I read a book that described "extremely human activities" like "gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag] I love that dancing is up there with gossip and arguing as an extremely human activity. But probably not the kind of dancing I was trained in. 

I make dance performances and films and I've been doing this for more than 30 years. They have all been tiny. Small scale. Insignificant. I am unheralded. Unheard of. Perhaps this is where human beings are most equal: in our complete cosmic insignificance. Perhaps Walt Whitman was wrong, and we are not large, and we do not contain multitudes. These performances were microscopic. No, that's not true, all were able to be seen with the naked eye although I like the idea of making literally microscopic dances. Each of these choreographies in my past reflected my interests -- and the interests of the people I collaborated with -- at the time. They reveal the changes in my interests through my life as an artist, and the things that have remained. (show stills). You might even say -- if you were being unkind -- that they were all really just about me. It's fine if you'd like to be unkind. You can be unkind right there in the Zoom chat -- I'll weep over it later. That's the thing when you _are_ a body, and a body that performs, it's hard for those choreographies not to be thought to be personal or about you (even if you don't want them to be). The emeritus professor of medicine and mindfulness Jon Kabat-Zinn describes how even the not me story is the story of me.

- I am performing for a camera like we have all been performing for camera these last two years. my armpits are sweaty. it's not even 2am local time. 

some kind of map to orient the listener/viewer?

What is my warrant in making these claims? What right do I have to suggest such things. I will let you decide depending on their value to you. 

### practice-research

At a certain point -- just over 20 years ago -- I started to integrate ideas about research into my dancing practice. I don't mean the commonplace kind of research that artists do into the subject of their work. For instance, if you were developing an artistic project about, say, climate change, then you'd do a whole lot of reading and background research into climate change. Your research would be a way for you to gather images, ideas, inspiration ... to become informed on the subject matter, while also stoking or loading your imagination. It's more like background information or work. I'm not talking about that kind of research -- like when funding organisations talk about 'research and development'. Not that there's anything wrong with this kind of research. Some of my best friends do research and development.  

I'm talking about: go to list (opportunity for meditation[^med] -- to interrupt me talking and to consider possibilities -- and use it fully [[making sense of dance research]]. This is what practice-as-research is. It is when we investigate ideas through artistic practices. It is not necessarily _about_ those practices (although it might be), but it is most definitely through those practices. 

Meditations. A way to knowledge that the time in this space, online, is a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances, limits. That in this time, there is time for you to reflect, note, imagine, drift. 

PaR - expansion. Blossoming. Products. 

> ‘Societies’, wrote Mauss, ‘live by borrowing from each other, but they define themselves rather by the refusal of borrowing than by its acceptance.’14[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 5, n.pag.]
- paradox of artistic research is desire for originality/uniqueness ... to be different. To stamp one's identity on an artistic work. Define ourselves by refusal of borrowing. But how to live? Openly borrow. System of exchange.

### zoom in: presence, body-based practices and now

So far, we have a body. In this moment, it is a body sitting in front of a screen. It is a body under pressure ... physical, psychological, cultural. How does your body feel right now? Where does it feel right now? What are you noticing? 

In dance and performance practices -- both in and outside of the University -- what do we artists do? We make performances. They are performances of enormously different scales, shapes, sizes, and colours. Sometimes they involve many many people, other times just a few (rarely just one, even when we call them "solos"). They are sometimes unpopular, sometimes popular -- although not nearly as culturally relevant as film or music. Sometimes they are under-developed, sometimes over-cooked, sometimes successful, sometimes not (however you might imagine 'success' to be gauged) They express ideas, they captivate, they alienate, they distract, they are didactic, they are open to interpretation. In dance -- or at least in so much of dance -- they are people moving (sometimes to music, sometimes not). It's absurd to attempt to characterise the set of global artistic practices that might fall under the banner of 'dance' or 'performance' as I've just done. So forgive me my hubris. But I'd like to propose that one thing all dance (perhaps all performance including theatre and opera) has is in common -- from social dancing, to artistic dancing -- is a concern or deep curiosity about something we call "presence." That _being present_ is an essential part of performance, and not being present is a bad thing. 

Nevertheless, most products -- including performances -- can be summed up as "take, make, use, lose."[Kate Raworth, in @krznaric-2021-good p.206] We take the Earth's materials, make them into things we want or like, use them a bit (or present them), and then they are discarded or lost. 

- use of resources in performing arts / spectacles.

You can imagine the tension or contradiction between such a mode of production, and a set of artistic practices bound to some idea of presence.  

Take. Make. Use. Lose. But be present. 

I have to confess that I've found the almost exclusively linear model of production in dance and performance to be increasingly disheartening. Each choreography, each performance seemed to take longer and longer to make (and to use more and more resources), but was seen less and less. The feeling of running to stand still got stronger and stronger, and certainly the economics no longer add up, if they ever did. Perhaps it's not surprising that for a number of reasons I've moved increasingly towards process-oriented body-based practices. These reasons are: i) an aging body -- it is physically capable of less; ii) sense of disillusionment with making and making and making for outcomes that were gone, often after only 2 or 3 performances; iii) deeper and deeper engagement with research through practice; iv) desire to seek practices that don't fit or make sense in current models of production. 

By process-oriented body-bases practices, I mean things like somatics that distinguish the body as observed from the outside -- the body as spectacle or as it is seen, oculocentric -- versus the soma as perceived from the inside. This distinction between inner and outer worlds, between what can be seen and what can only be felt is an important one. It is perhaps even radical given just how visually oriented human beings are in a world of TikTok (etc), and that body-based practices like somatics seem to resist so many of the tropes of the body under pressure: pressure to take, pressure to make, pressure to use, pressure to lose. The pressures of production.  

If I consider body-based practices with respect to the conditions and history of practice-research, then such practices are unique for five reasons. First, they have a complex and often fraught relationship with language. That is, how does language function (in a descriptive or analytical way) with these practices? Limited. Second, as I've just said, the experiential nuances are not seen but felt. Third, these practices intersect with contested issues of so-called embodied knowledge and tacit awareness. That is, when one is doing these practices, how might we recognise what is understood by the practitioners, and how that understanding changes with practice? Fourth, these practices complicate decades-old problems in practice-research to do arts practices that are ephemeral (or that 'disappear') and how they might be documented, and how they even resist documentation. Fifth, and finally, they ask us to slow down. 

- [[weber-fechner law]] - and compare with [[Magnason - On Time and Water#Back in time]] -- slow slow slow down. 
> The first step is to give more individual humans and small groups time: slack time, to adjust themselves and their relationships to contemporary reality.[@munger-2021-it n.pag]

But what kinds of practices am I talking about? Feldenkrais, Alexander technique, BMC, ideokinesis, Skinner Release Technique. One other is the oddly named Authentic Movement. 
It affords a body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. Contemplative practices like AM are also often beyond the reach of language and are complicated to document. In _Finger Pointing Moon_ AM is a prototypical system through which to observe the epistemic limits and possibilities of body-based work, and to propose extrapolations of these limits to other practice-research fields; for example theatre, visual art and music. 

In 2019 the dancer-choreographer Shaun McLeod and I worked together with the movement practice called Authentic Movement. What can be said about what happened in that space during those six weeks of practice? If all of us here had been there what would we all have heard and/or seen that we could agree on?

One person -- the mover -- had their eyes closed. The other person -- the watcher -- was watching the mover. The watcher was also holding a smartphone _directed_ towards the mover, but was not paying attention to the phone's screen. A phone hyphen camera is not a regular part of Authentic Movement and you may or may not know that.

The mover moved around the space; sometimes this was more like a series of stillnesses, other times it was everyday: like walking or sitting. Still other times the mover might do things that were a little less everyday. These movements were sometimes strung together; most of us in this room would call that -- or recognise it as -- contemporary dance, or maybe somatically informed contemporary dance if we were being a bit fancy. But it was definitely not the kind of contemporary dance I've seen on "So You Think You Can Dance". [expand: so.mp4] I would say the mover looked a little like they were _feeling_ or _sensing_, maybe _looking inside_. But I couldn't be sure, and nor do I think we would agree on this.

It turns out that the smartphone was taking a photograph every 30 seconds, and the screen was darkened so the watcher wouldn't know when a photo was being taken nor how anything might be framed in the lens of the camera. 

Here is a set of photos from one 20 minute Authentic Movement session with Shaun as the mover. [expand: 31shaun.jpg]]

This collection of photos is the visual remains of the practice. It is thirty-one photos, randomly framed, systematically taken and turned into a collection -- as if to seem complete. The strip is probably quite rich compared with how I've just verbally described what was happening in the studio. We can see the room, positions on the floor, clothing, the light, postures, hints of gestures, expressions. But an enormous quantity of experiential data have not made it from what was in the room to what you can see here. 

We can also infer some things from these photos, the most seductive being what kind of movement occurred. But we are _inferring_ movement, and by that I mean _implying_. We'd also be inferring understanding, and we would be inferring the presence or absence of this thing that gets called _embodied knowledge_. Even if these images were replaced by video ... still be inferring. It would still be 

I think his concept of resolution is useful, even if I am robbing him of his thinking that was written for a particular context in a particular field. My digital theft of de Sousa Santos' thinking is to remind us that when we are dealing with body-based practices what we can observe bears little or no relationship to the experiential complexity of what happened. That is, we have high resolution experiences, and low resolution representations of those experiences. And that gap applies irrespective of how fancy our technocratic solutions are to the problem of archiving movement and choreography.

- see also [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]
Perhaps it's not surprising that these kinds of practices like authentic movement seem to mirror mindfulness strategies (and growing industry of mindfulness in the West -- McMindfulness). Like that Zizek who talked about checking out. But also a way to cope. To cope with the pressure of neoliberalism. 

- constraint/limitation of PaR -- oriented towards the self (and often solo practices)

- understand this to be vital important work. The unit of our experience. The means to our experience. Some Damasio here?

In this moment non-judgmentally 


I must be careful here. I think it's too easy to conflate two types of _now_. One seems to be an obsession with now that distracts us from the past or the future. This is what Bateson calls it:

> the [4] great irony of our time,” writes the anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, “is that even as we are living longer, we are thinking shorter.”2 This is the age of the tyranny of the now.[@krznaric-2021-good pp.4-5]

> Quick now, here, now, always—  
> Ridiculous the waste sad time  
> Stretching before and after. 

-- TS Eliot, Four Quartets
Seems like a nowness that is an [[obsession with generating noise]] - vs signal

Distinct from The timeless quality of the present moment. I see this as a kind of paradox of time (or scale and time?). The one version of 'now' voids the past, present and future. The other harnesses the present to expand our understanding, experience and imagination of the past and the future. 

### zoom out: artistic practices for the future

#### Being out of touch

What became clear, even in the earliest days of the pandemic, was that touching others -- making physical contact with others -- was under direct and immediate pressure to change. We went from people who touch each other all of the time (in different circumstances, conventions and situations) to a species that avoided touch. We avoided touch to protect ourselves and to protect others. For some, this was a kind of relief; for others not at all. We became out of touch.

To be _out of touch_ in English of course means to be disconnected or out of date. As if we have no remaining touch left. "Sorry I'm all out of touch. I have no touch left to give." The way in which middle-aged people become out of touch with the culture and language of young people. As in: That guy is so out of touch. Not up to speed. Disconnected. Not with it. To no longer be able to 'read the room' because the room has moved on beyond one's grasp.

Yet we felt the pressure to stay connected or be in touch. We experienced -- and likely still experience -- zoom fatigue. A kind of hyper-connectivity made possible by 21st century technologies. We were desperate to stay in touch while knowing deep down in our zoom-fatigued bodies that we also remained deeply out of touch. Touch was dangerous. Touch was certainly no longer innocent (was it ever?)

I started (and continue) to get the sense that this work was out of touch. That all this work. Disconnected. 

Trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, rapacious human body. Pressure. Force. Stress. Strain. That when I start to reflect critically on the work I'm doing, and while taking into account the scale of time, of individualism, of now-ness, of personal ambition, and most pressing of all the climate emergency, I start to wonder, what might a body-based practice be in the long now? In deep time? as if "blinded by the excess of clarity" [@merton-1954-elected p.30] with respect to what is now commonly -- but not officially in the geologic time scale -- referred to as the anthropocene: 

> a proposed geological epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene)

Limitation. Narrow the attention. The resources. To touch the earth and our bodies on it lightly. But what do I mean by _scale of time?_

#### The game of people we loved and were loved by

There's a simple game to play; it's a game based on people we loved and were loved by. I first read about it in Andri Snaer Magnason's _On Time and Water_. 

> When is someone you will love still going to be alive?[@magnason-2021-time p.308]

> [This is the] time you can touch with your own hands. Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds you. And your time is also the time of the people you will know and love. The time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future every single day.’[@magnason-2021-time p.309]

The game of people we loved and were loved by. Gladys. Recording of her singing? Zoe. Delusions of grandeur. 1913 (2005) - 1937 (2021) - 1968 - 1980 - 2016 - 2106
Just five generations, only two of these people are dead.

193 years. This small, insignificant, delicate body extended through time. It's traumas, hopes, dreams, desires, limitations; it's 206 discrete bones, 650 or so muscles, 100 billion neurons. This a body that counts. These are the bodies that count. 

[[Magnason - On Time and Water#^f0cae3]] -- purposelessness. Focus on the empty. But to build these practices so that they touch the earth lightly. 

#### to be a good ancestor

There's another version of this game in which you imagine yourself to be that last person you know who will love you -- in this case my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig -- and write a letter to yourself as if you were that person. Might she describe me as a good ancestor? That these practices of performance, dance and film are insignificant compared with how I stepped on the planet so that I might have been a good ancestor for Zoe Ellis-Craig. (video of her?) Will she judge my life as "laughable and foolish"[@magnason-2021-time p.259] or recognise how I squandered resource after resource making dances about myself ;-)? That even the not me dances were really the me dances. 

Concept of good ancestor. There was a man called Jonas Salk. He looked like this. Salk died in 1995, and he was an American virologist and medical researcher most famous for one single thing: the development of the polio vaccine. 

> The most important question we must ask ourselves is, "Are we being good ancestors?" So said Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine in 1953 but refused to patent it--forgoing profit so that more lives could be saved. Salk's radical generosity to future generations should inspire us. But when leading philosopher Roman Krznaric examines society today, he sees just the opposite: Our short term, exploitative mindsets have "colonized the future." (The Good Ancestor blurb)

> Is there an ideal time horizon to which we should aspire in the tug-of-war against short-termism? This book proposes a hundred years as a minimum threshold for long-term thinking. This is the current length of a long human lifespan, taking us beyond the ego [p.15] boundary of our own mortality so we begin to imagine futures that we can influence yet not participate in ourselves.[@krznaric-2021-good pp.14-15]

> An essential starting point is to develop a sense of deep-time humility, where we grasp the insignificance of our own transitory existence in relation to the vast time frame of cosmic history, freeing our minds to look both far into the past and beyond our lifetimes into a distant future. We must accept the reality that our personal stories from birth to death, and all the achievements and tragedies of human civilization, will barely register in the annals of cosmological time.[@krznaric-2021-good p.39]


> The Arrow concerns the extent to which we are responsible for the future consequences of our actions. One of its best-known formulations appears in the writing of philosopher Derek Parfit:
> >Remoteness in time has, in itself, no more significance than remoteness in space. Suppose that I shoot some arrow into a distant wood, where it wounds some person. If I should have known that there might be someone in this wood, I am guilty of gross negligence. Because this person is far away, I cannot identify the person whom I harm. But this is no excuse. Nor is it any excuse that this person is far away. We should make the same claims about effects on people who are temporally remote.18 [@krznaric-2021-good p.81]
- these are bodies under pressure: the bodies of the future, organisms of the future. They are out of sight, and out of mind these bodies under pressure. Their futures are being colonized by our present.

“Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.” - Huxley

> Suzuki recognizes that seeing humans as interdependent with the living world lies at the heart of the seventh-generation principle. The environment is not something “out there”; as he puts it, “we are the environment.” We are connected to the landscape, just as we are to future generations, through the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil in which we grow our food.
> The oxygen we breathe in, for instance, circulates in our blood-stream and around half remains in our lungs, so there is no clear line separating where the air ends and we begin. When we exhale, our breath mixes with the air and is taken in by other people, birds, mammals, and reptiles. “If I am air and you are air, then I am you,” writes Suzuki. But the atoms in the air also persist through time. According to one study, there are 3 x 1019 (three followed by nineteen zeros) argon atoms in a breath of air. These quintillions of atoms are continually being blown around the planet, so wherever you are, you will breathe in around 15 argon atoms that you breathed in a year earlier. And that’s not all. Each breath we take contains argon atoms that were probably once inhaled by Cleopatra and Gautama Buddha, and will be breathed in by our descendants seven generations from today. “Air,” says Suzuki, plays an essential role “linking all life in a single matrix, and joining past, present and future in a single flowing entity.”32 [@krznaric-2021-good p.88]

Whitman was right after all. We do contain multitudes. 


> To recognize the close parallels between private property and notions of the sacred is also to recognize what is so historically odd about European social thought. Which is that – quite unlike free societies – we take this absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human rights and freedoms. This is what the political scientist C. B. Macpherson meant by ‘possessive individualism’. Just as every man’s home is his castle, so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the idea that you own your own body, just as you own your chattels and possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or house, or car, and so on.53 As we’ve seen, those who did not share this particular European conception of the sacred could indeed be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned – and, from Amazonia to Oceania, they often were. [@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag.]

Maps and territory - human body 

To de-instrumentalise the body. It's not a body FOR this or that thing. It is a body that is. It is a body under stress. Under pressure. It is not a body under pressure in order for something else to happen: justice, etc. professionalisation of arts through PaR creates this danger quite explicitly. It creates bodies in the service of. The body as yet another resource to be consumed. These are bodies under stress. Body as a tool - a technology - to "as a tool for assuaging my own anxiety" (4000 weeks). To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More awarded. A body radically in the present - not judged for another(future) means. 

> "Because children grow up, we think a child’s purpose is to grow up,” Herzen says. “But a child’s purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn’t disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment…Life’s bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.” -- 4000 weeks. 

The purpose of this body, under these conditions is to be this body under these conditions. These are the practices, the researches in which we resist temptation to make it a body under these conditions in order to be a body under other (instrumental) conditions. To write/understand that body as it was, this body as it is. The question then, is, what is the purpose of this body in this practice? That to understand it's purpose or purposes is to start to enter deeply the mangle of practice. That even under the worst conditions of stress, pain, and pressure, if we look to the future or futures then we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as a territory. That those futures are only maps. Useful, interesting, but partial, flawed and red herrings. The research is in the body as territory

Resist with all our hearts the instrumental and future-focused way. That industrial PAR will do this. In order to do or get this I must do this. 

>  Admittedly, it’s not entirely our own fault that we approach our finite time in such a perversely instrumental and future-focused way. Powerful external pressures push us in this direction, too, because we exist inside an economic system that is instrumentalist to its core. One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit. Seeing things this way helps explain the otherwise mysterious truth that rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable. They’re very good at instrumentalizing their time, for the purpose of generating wealth for themselves; that’s the definition of being successful in a capitalist world. But in focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness.

That we find or be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else (including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, measured, etc). They are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies (the ultimate body to be swiped, or scrolled). These Are Radically analogue bodies in now. that are meeting and sensitive to deep time / long now.

Kind of opposite to Brand's stuff in lithium. To slow down the art. To wrestle it from the culture of rapidity.

I am proposing that we must seek methods of making that distill production from consumption; that our work is to pry apart the discombobulating effects of screendancing to be seen, and to do this in plain sight. I understand screendance to be a small enough field—and collection of practices—to interrogate and resist the logic of production predicated on consumption. We have talked about such resistance for years as a community but as dance has become more and more visible on social media, the temptation is to celebrate these days in the sun, and turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] Western culture's crash zoom to social media since around the introduction of Facebook's Like button in 2009[@alter-2017-irresistible Chapter 5 Feedback, n.pag.] has made the stakes high and ambiguous for screendance: the promise of being transmitted and seen (finally!) at the cost of extractive consumption and the "immediacy of appropriation":[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]



Not to do this in order to ... that understanding its purpose (including the possibility it has no purpose) is one's only task. When shift from that you are serving something or someone else. They feel different. I can feel the difference now. Typing while on my bed. I am quite into this. Deep in thought, in reading. I am in the process of coming to understand what to present and how. Not because of what it might bring me, but because of the ideas themselves. No utility. It is the body "in the service of" that creates the pressure and stress. but humility??



> [Heidegger's] answer is that our being is totally, utterly bound up with our finite time. So bound up, in fact, that the two are synonymous: to be, for a human, is above all to exist temporally, in the stretch between birth and death, certain that the end will come, yet unable to know when. We tend to speak about our having a limited amount of time. But it might make more sense, from Heidegger’s strange perspective, to say that we are a limited amount of time. That’s how completely our limited time defines us.[@burkeman-2021-four Chapter 3 Facing Finitude: Thrown into Time, n.pag.]

That is, we are time. 

"Entering space and time completely" - von Franz [in @burkeman-2021-four]

Quality of the questioning. The questions lack precision. They are more like drag nets. Capturing all. What is the risk in the precision? To narrow attention. I don't have evidence of this. It's a feeling. Perhaps a proposition. 

- domestication -- requires human intervention (else it dies). opposite of this for PaR and the body. The danger of domestication. Keeping it wild. The lightest of touches. But also narrowing and being specific. (re questions).

### two propositions

(one imagined, the other started)

Haiku by Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828): (was a Japanese poet and lay Buddhist priest)

In this world  
we walk on the roof of hell  
gathering blossoms.

> who do we think of, when we use the pronoun “we”? And I want my “we” to be absolutely continuous amongst my fellow humans, amongst living beings, amongst the largeness of the expanding universe, down to the tiniest physics and particle. -- Jane Hirshfield (https://onbeing.org/programs/jane-hirshfield-the-fullness-of-things/#)

> nothing we produce can hold a candle to the ocean itself, nothing is as magnificent as a glacier,[p.260] nothing so mysterious as a rainforest at night. Nothing we have done will be considered remarkable if achieving it has meant closing our eyes to science and throwing away the life and happiness of future generations.[@magnason-2021-time pp.259-260]

So, yes, just collecting blossoms while acknolweding the heat from below. to make something for the future that is not about legacy. That we thought about them. We paid them attention, even as continued to suck fossil fuels out of the ground. 

_Conditions for these proposals:_

- atelic
- intrinsic (not dependent on extrinsic resources -- care for externalities)
- body is present (why?)
- minimal footprint

They are practices that are defined by not being able to be completed (see Eno essay). Their ontology is to be ongoing. Work that goes on. That is followed. They stretch into time the way those we love and who love us:

> Taking a walk in the countryside, like listening to a favorite song or meeting friends for an evening of conversation, is thus a good example of what the philosopher Kieran Setiya calls an “atelic activity,” meaning that its value isn’t derived from its telos, or ultimate aim. You shouldn’t be aiming to get a walk “done”; nor are you likely to reach a point in life when you’ve accomplished all the walking you were aiming to do. “You can stop doing these things, and you eventually will, but you cannot complete them,” Setiya explains. They have “no outcome whose achievement exhausts them and therefore brings them to an end.” And so the only reason to do them is for themselves alone: “There is no more to going for a walk than what you are doing right now.” (4000 weeks)

Atelic: Presenting an action or event as being incomplete. (Is a hobby!) But there's a lie here isn't there? But in recognising the difference we are changed. Our bodies are changed. The pressures are changed. 

> We need more lithium today, and merely hope to find greater reserves—or a suitable replacement—tomorrow. This revaluation has the effect of shifting the place of the natural order from something intrinsic to our practices to something extrinsic. The whole of nature becomes what economists tellingly call an _externality_.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

#### The steward

> Ise Jingū, Japan
> A Shinto shrine that has been torn down and rebuilt to exactly the same design every 20 years since 690 CE. A building forever new and forever ancient.[@krznaric-2021-good p.96]

- what kind of framework for an practice like this. One in which the infrastructure is replaced every 20 years. What might we understand by infrastructure in this case? That in its cyclical destruction and construction is gathers resilience and mobility: the capacity to absorb contemporary pressure, be ready for unseen and unknown stressors, and to be flexible.  
- resilience of body under pressure
- infrastructure of a shared body; a body unable to be owned, a public body. Or perhaps it's a name ... dance of the long now. _Custodians_. To do one dance a year at a specific time and place. How would this body be named? It does not even need an audience. 
- Flexibility, absorbing strain, lightness 
- infrastructure with the long now in mind. So different from the short now. 

> Cities are tangible things. Certain elements of their physical infrastructure – walls, roads, parks, sewers – might remain fixed for hundreds or even thousands of years; but in human terms they are never stable. People are constantly moving in and out of them, whether permanently, or seasonally for holidays and festivals, to visit relatives, trade, raid, tour around, and so on; or just in the course of their daily rounds. Yet cities have a life that transcends all this. This is not because of the permanence of stone or brick or adobe; neither is it because most people in a city actually meet one another. It is because they will often think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or Muscovites or Calcuttans.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 
- a practice more akin to a city? It is a thing that depends on certain characteristics. Hong Kong. geography, history, architecture. 

> In other words, from the perspective of someone living in an ancient city, the city itself was not so entirely different from earlier landscapes of clans or moieties that extended across hundreds of miles. It was a structure raised primarily in the human imagination, which allowed for the possibility of amicable relations with people they had never met.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]

> The particular mix depended largely on where in the world the cities happened to be, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that history’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]
- a practice with small footprint 
- Of all my privileges, this one -- to be able to imagine futures beyond my current needs -- is one that seems vital to take advantage of.


#### This body

> By understanding as a full-body phenomenon the consciousness that lenses our view of reality and shapes our life-experience, we can not only become better stewards of our own bodies and of the planet we share with other bodies, human and nonhuman, but we can begin to dismantle the artificial hierarchies and categories by which we have long bolstered our creaturely centrality across the various scales and spectra of existence, from Ptolemism to anthropocentrism to racism, choosing instead to be both humbled and hallowed by the evolutionary wonder of consciousness.

Recently, whenever I meet or see someone, I've been asking them a simple question. What is your body to you? I then ask them to respond by starting with the words "This body" (or however that may be translated into their mother language). For instance, in Italian, it would be "Questo corpo".

Note how I started with "I have a body". Ownership.

Meditation.

I would love for you to email yours to me -- in whichever language you choose. Or even just put them in the chat. This would be a beautiful gift and it would honour me.

I like to imagine having a physical location to collect all these instances of _this body_, perhaps like Nichlas Luhrman's zettelkasten or slipboxes (image). Like the analogue library catalogues I remember from my youth. Each instance a removable card: something to be held, to be touched, reflected on. Something that long after my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig is dead, some time after 2106, would not require any hidden fires to sustain it, but just a little bit of space in someone's home. People could visit it, photograph it, steal from it, add to it. Perhaps such a simple thing might be a way to become a good ancestor while paying attention to the smallness of the human body.  

Here is a sample of what I have collected so far.  

This body is aging
This body makes things possible 
This body is constantly reinventing itself 
This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies 
This body knows how to walk, run and dance
This body is not like the others
This body feels
This body is wounded 
This body sees and is seen
This body has buried the bodies of others 
This body adapts
This body has been exploited 
This body cannot be known
This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard" 
This body is at a loss
This body houses these feelings 
This body is consciousness and self-knowing 
This body cannot escape technology
This body is unknown and cannot be known
This body is bleeding
This body is broken
This body is a time-traveler
This body is overwhelmed in detail 
This body is the place through which experiences flood 
This body is where I need to go
This body belongs to this mind
This body trusts you
This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory 
This body is in pain
This body has no boundary
This body has betrayed me. 
This body is worthy of trust. 
This body is mine (Lee Miller, 20220108)
This body is not far from death and I am not afraid
This body will die
This body humbles me over and over again

Thank you. And thank you once again for being given this tremendous honour to present these ideas to you this morning. It has been a pleasure and this body is most certainly humbled.

### unused meditations

This is the body that takes the time it needs to take. I think this is body based PaR. A body under consideration that takes the time it needs to take. 

Q (for meditation?): what is the role of "control" and "force" in such a body?

Meditation: what is the role of patience in your work and research? What (if anything) does it have to do with originality? 

Meditation: when to admit to not-knowing? That the territory is unattainable. That paradox lies at the heart of research. 

### uncertain

> As Milton Friedman put it, while a crisis provides the opportunity for change, “when that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.”28 The tragedy of the 2008 financial crisis was that there was no obvious alternative economic vision on offer.[@krznaric-2021-good p.114]

What does it mean to go slow? Consider that word. P155 of Time and Water - about plastic. Must must slow down. 

> In a world where changes in many areas have been exponential, there have been more changes in the last decade than in the entire twentieth century.

> Most of the products you will see—from socks to smartphones to cotton balls to deodorant—are made through an old-fashioned linear model of industrial design that Kate Raworth sums up as “take, make, use, lose.”  We take Earth’s materials, make them into things we want, use them for a while—sometimes only once—and then throw them away. And it is this linear degenerative economic model that pushes us over the brink of planetary boundaries.26 [@krznaric-2021-good p.206]

> Kirk explained that there are two ways to make a map: actual exploration to collect your own data, and using data provided by other people. Either way, maps are about layers. If you’re using existing data, you might start with elevation, then use a different set of data to layer on roads, then perhaps use hydrography data to find the lakes, streams, and rivers, and so on. He helped me understand that while different maps may use different layers, the one thing that all maps do is provide readers with orientation.[@brown-2021-atlas Introduction>You are here, n.pag.]
