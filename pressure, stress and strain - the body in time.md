# pressure, stress and strain - the body in time [.h1]

## self-introduction: I am a body [.self]

Good morning everyone and thank you so much to the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts for the invitation to present to you. My name is Simon Ellis and, just in case you are wondering, I have a body, and this body is not just a head and shoulders. [body.jpg] 

That word _have_ in "I have a body" is strange. Like a possession. As in: [catcar] I have a car or I have a cat. If I were to say "I am a body" then, in English at least, it seems to diminish my agency or identity, as if I am _only_ a body. How would that idea translate into Cantonese? or Hindi? 

So in English when we say "I have a body" it's hard to shake this sense of it being something external that we have possession of. [ad.png] Neurobiologist Antonio Damasio simply states that consciousness itself is the recognition that feelings and sensations belong to this body of mine.[@damasio-2021-feeling] In their 2021 book [doe.jpg] _The Dawn of Everything_, anthropologist David Graeber and archeologist David Wengrow describe the sacred quality of private property in historical European social thought, and how this sacred quality extends to ownership of our own bodies as a kind of human right.

In saying all this -- in this rather strange introduction -- you might have guessed that I am a dancer, and to state the obvious, this means I am interested in the body. Graeber and Wengrow describe "extremely human activities" like "gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag] I love that dancing is there with gossip and arguing as an extremely human activity. 

I make dance performances and films and I've been doing this for about 30 years. They have all been tiny. Insignificant. Perhaps this is where human beings are most equal: in our complete cosmic insignificance. These performances I made were microscopic. No, that's not true, all were able to be seen with the naked eye although I like the idea of making literally microscopic dances. These choreographies reveal in time my interests as an artist.[previous-works] You might even say -- if you were being unkind -- that these choreographies were all really just about me. [jkz.jpg] The health and mindfulness specialist Jon Kabat-Zinn describes how, in meditation (and in life) even the _not me story_ is the _story of me_. It's fine, by the way, if you'd like to be unkind. You can be unkind right there in the Zoom chat.[arrow] Could there be a more contemporary way to start an online conference than with a bit of chat-room trolling? 

What follows this morning is a guided -- or maybe misguided -- tour of the body under pressure and in time. At its heart are the things each of us makes, and for whom -- and for when -- they are made. 

### a brief aside [.ptbrief]

[yudkowsky.jpg] There's an Artificial Intelligence theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky who is best known for creating the term "friendly artificial intelligence." In his blogging days he used to include what he called _meditations_ or "puzzles" for readers to think through.[@yudkowsky-2012-useful n.p.] I'm going to steal Yudkowsky's idea this morning but with two different purposes in mind. The first is to recognise that time in this online space -- a webinar -- is experienced as a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances and limits; and to acknowledge that how I choreograph this space-time makes a difference to how you experience it. The second is to provoke specific reflections from you. Each _meditation_ will last 1 minute, and each will give you a chance to rest, reflect, note or drift as you prefer. I imagine some of you might even flick over to check your email -- maybe something important has arrived. You. Never. Know.

Here's 1 minute. [timer.mp4]

### understanding practice-research [.ptund]

At a certain point -- just over 20 years ago -- I started to integrate ideas about research into my dancing. Here's a brief and rather curious list. 

[.ptlist]
- Science research  
- Pizza research 
- Music research 
- Dance research  

When we attach the word 'research' to anything it implies a desire to find out or understand something differently. If I say to a friend that I need to do some research before choosing a pizza place tonight they'd understand that there's a decision to be made, and that without the _research_ we might not get to eat the best pizza. 

Now let's apply two different words to each of the items in the list above:

[.pt2list]

- research about science | research through science  
- research about pizza | research through pizza  
- research about music | research through music  
- research about dance | research through dance  

The word _about_ tells us the object of the research, but not how that research might happen. For example, research _about_ music might be something relatively informal or trivial like a web search to find the latest release from a particular artist. But research _about_ music also might use formal historical methods (within the traditions or conventions that historians use) to understand a piece of music differently. In the same way, research _about_ dance might use anthropology, history, sociology, or science (etc) as methods to increase human understanding of dance. 

When we research _through_ something a method is already implied, but the object is not. Research through science uses the scientific method to explore a phenomenon. Research through dance uses the practices of dance in order to explore ideas, phenomena, etc. In both cases, what is able to be examined, what is understood, and how understanding is presented (or made accessible) is in no small part determined by the methods used. 

This is what practice-as-research is. It is when we investigate ideas through artistic practices. It is not necessarily _about_ those practices (although it often is), but it is most definitely through those practices. 

### jump cut to talk about pressure, stress and strain; oh ... and neoliberalism [.ptjump]

I have a friend who is an exercise physiologist. His name is Jim, Jim Cotter. Here he is. Not so long ago he and I were in a car together and I asked Jim if he was stressed. He smiled because his first thought was to think of stress the way physical scientists or engineers think about the term. It goes something like this:

Stress is "generated whenever a force is applied on a body to deform it".[@deyin-nodate-pressure n.pag.] Stress is produced inside a material body. 

Pressure, then, is the "intensity of external forces acting at a point." Pressure is exerted on the body.[@deyin-nodate-pressure n.pag.]

Jim also used another word: strain.

Strain is how stress is measured in the physical sciences, and is a material property of a body's change in shape. It refers to the "amount of deformation experienced by the body".[@noauthor-nodate-stress] Think of how a flexible or malleable body responds to pressure -- an external force -- differently from a rigid body. Not better or worse, just differently. 

In psychology, stress is the feeling we get when we perceive pressure from internal or external conditions as being beyond our ability to cope. In both understandings of stress, there is a point beyond which we -- our bodies, or the material bodies in question -- cannot cope. There is some quantity of psychological or physical deformation beyond which we -- or systems, or bodies -- break. We cannot continue deforming. 

In the arts and humanities in the UK, when we talk about pressure, stress and strain at work, we often pair those experiences or feelings with the word neoliberalism. In some way, neoliberalism generates pressure that causes stress that -- in time or at times -- we feel unable to cope with. That we are being deformed by neoliberalism. 

The everyday version of this "uninhibited private market"[@verdouw-2017-subject p.524] underpins unregulated hyper-individualism, ill-conceived faith in the meritocracy,[@sandel-2020-tyranny] loneliness, and the commodification of behaviour and thought.[see for instance, @zuboff-2019-age] Neoliberalism drives the idea that each of us is solely responsible for continual production. The pressure to produce without careful consideration of the physical, temporal, material and psychological resources available both now and in the future is disastrous. This. Now this. Now this. _This_ is a body under pressure. 

[hamster.mp4]

Each of us -- as academics, as artists, as teachers, as human beings -- will have felt these demands in various volumes and ways. But the worst part is that "short-termism is built into the genetic code of the neoliberal paradigm."[@krznaric-2021-good p.196]

### zoom in: presence, body-based practices and now [.pt1zoom]

#### being present [.ptbeing]

In dance and performance practices -- both in and outside of the University -- what do we choreographers and artists do? We make art and performances. I'd like to propose one thing all dance (perhaps even all performance including theatre and opera) has in common -- from social dancing, to artistic dancing -- is a concern for, pleasure in, and deep curiosity about something called many things, but most often _presence_. That _being present_ is an essential part of dancing -- perhaps even an essential part of being human -- and somehow not being present is a bad thing, or something to be avoided. Being present is the opposite of blanking while performing; or being so self-conscious -- or perhaps hyper-judgmental -- while out social dancing that your body refuses to move, or you refuse to move it. [wedding.mp4]

And if you were to quietly agree with me, at least for a moment, that being present -- whatever that really is -- seems important, then it is more than a little odd that most products or things we make -- including performances -- can be summed up by the economist Kate Raworth as "take, make, use, lose."[Raworth, in @krznaric-2021-good p.206] In other words, we take the Earth's materials, make them into things we want or like, use them a bit (or present them), and then they are discarded or lost. 

I think you can entertain or imagine the tension or contradiction between such a mode of production, and a set of artistic practices predicated on presence. It's a strange formula:

Take. Make. Use. Lose. Oh, and yeah, be present. 

#### one type of now: process-oriented body-based artistic practices [.pt1type]

The linear model of production in dance and performance is unsustainable. The feeling of running to stand still is getting stronger. Under these conditions of production, I've become increasingly curious about process-oriented body-based practices. By these I mean things like somatics that distinguish the body as observed from the outside versus the soma as perceived from the inside. These are practices known by names like Feldenkrais, Alexander technique and Skinner Releasing Technique. 

The distinction I've just stated between inner and outer worlds, between what can be seen and what can only be felt, is an important one. It is perhaps even _radical_ given our oculocentric TikToking Instagramming world, and that body-based practices like somatics seem to resist so many of the tropes of the body under pressure: pressure to take, pressure to make, pressure to use, pressure to lose. The pressures of production.

Another somatic practice commonly used in dance is the oddly named Authentic Movement. Authentic Movement was developed as a therapy, but it is also used by dance and movement artists as a way to tune the body's senses, and less commonly as choreographic process and performance.[e.g. @mcleod-2016-movement] There are two roles; the first is the mover who has their eyes closed. This person moves in direct response to what they are experiencing, remembering, feeling, sensing or imagining. Their task or activity is to be awake to the "full universe of sensations associated with the body being itself,"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon n.pag] and to cultivate awareness without judgement. The other person keeps the mover physically safe, and simply observes them without judgement. They change roles. Two people, one observing their inner world and moving, the other observing the other person in the outer world. 

What is profound about Authentic Movement is the simple-in-theory attempt to practice internal and external observation without judgement. How often in our lives -- other than when we were very small children -- do we get to move, play and be without judgment? For adults it's difficult to imagine what lies outside of judgement. 

It might already seem quite clear to you that Authentic Movement is really a contemplative practice like mindfulness; a set of processes in which we practice "the timeless present we call now";[Kabat-Zinn in @mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon _Mindfulness of the body as a whole_ n.pag.] where we breathe and move out of clock time and into non-judgemental awareness. 

But so what?

I want to propose that such practices remind us that there is an opportunity -- regardless of our roles as artists, or teachers or researchers -- to seek methods of doing what we do that distill production from consumption. That rather than making something simply to be seen (or consumed in some other way), we interrogate our responsibilities as practitioners and seek to de-instrumentalize processes of making in order to understand more slowly and deeply their purpose; to consider deeply that to understand their purpose (including the possibility that they have no purpose) is one's only task. That as soon as we cease "holding the whole body in awareness"[@mindfulnessappsswedenab-2021-jon] we jolt into the unwieldy self-consciousness of instrumental production: I do this in order to get this sometime in the near future. These are our bodies that gravitate towards wondering what something might bring us. The consequences of this gravitational pull towards I, me and my are devastating. They are devastating not only because of the profound internal and external stressors created by short-term production, but because they lead us to turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.]

### zoom out: artistic practices for the future [.pt2zoom]

#### Being out of touch [.pttouch]

What became clear, even in the earliest days of the pandemic, was that touching others -- making physical contact with others -- was under direct and immediate pressure to change. We went from people who touch each other all of the time (in different circumstances, conventions and situations) to a species that avoided touch. We became out of touch. Touch was dangerous. Touch was contagious.

To be _out of touch_ in English means of course to be disconnected or out of date, as if we have no remaining touch left. During the pandemic, I reflected on the possibility that all of this work -- and in particular all of _my_ work -- was out of touch. 

This had nothing at all to do with the pandemic and everything to do with fire. 

In _On Time and Water_ Andri Magnason reminds us of the 1700s in Scotland when James Watt gifted humankind the steam engine. Magnason describes it like this:

> Watt allowed us to tame fire; gradually we learned to hide the flames better, isolating the heat, smoke and soot until fire has become invisible under the glossy hoods of air-conditioned cars that go cruising around the world with their upholstered seats and pumping music.[@magnason-2021-time p.191]

This is how we humans are really out of touch: the mechanisms by which we burn resources are powerfully hidden from view. These invisible fires have fueled, and continue to fuel, what is now commonly -- but not officially in the geologic time scale -- referred to as the anthropocene.[darth?]

I seem to have created a terrible mess here. How to knit together these various things I've placed on this shared desktop? I am trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, rapacious human body in a way that each of us might find useful. This is not some abstract, hypothetical game with no consequences. Pressure. Stress. Strain. Time. That if I start to take into account the time beyond one's own lifetime, individualism, now-ness, personal ambition, and most pressing of all the climate emergency, I start to wonder, what might a body-based practice be in the long now? In deep time? 

#### The game of people you have loved and who will love you [.ptgame]

There's a simple game to play. The game is to measure the span of time of people you have loved and who will love you.[@magnason-2021-time p.308]

My grandmother, Gladys Hopkins, was born in 1913. Here she is singing. Gladys gave birth to my mother, Gabrielle Eastwood, in 1937. Here she is in 1960. I was born in 1968, and here I am in about 1973. My niece Rebecca was born in 1980; and Rebecca's daughter -- my great niece -- Zoe Ellis-Craig was born in 2016. If we imagine that Zoe lives until she is 90 then this would mean she would die in 2106. 

From 1913 to 2106 is 193 years of people I have loved and who have loved me. 193 years. This small, insignificant, delicate body extended through time, and "beyond the ego boundary of [my] own mortality".[@krznaric-2021-good pp.14-15] This body's hopes, dreams, traumas, desires, and limitations; its 206 discrete bones, 650 or so muscles, and 100 billion neurons. This a body that counts. These are the bodies that count. 

#### To be a good ancestor [.ptgood]

In his recent book _The Good Ancestor_ (2021) the self-described public philosopher -- Roman Krznaric -- writes about Jonas Salk. Salk was an American virologist most famous for one thing: the development of the polio vaccine. Salk refused to patent the vaccine so it would be a gift to humanity, and he also said that the most important question we must ask ourselves is this:

"Are we being good ancestors?"

I love this question. It is haunting, and for me it operates on two profound levels. The first is that it engenders a strong sense of what Krznaric describes as "deep-time humility"[@krznaric-2021-good p.39] in which our radical insignificance as organisms is underlined. The second is about responsibility towards the bodies and lives of the future. These temporally remote bodies are the bodies under real pressure. They are out of sight and out of mind, and their futures are being colonized by our rapacious present. We are, according to the Paleontologist Tim Flannery, “the future eaters”.[in @krznaric-2021-good p.141]

None of this is surprising particularly given just how seductive is the logic of instrumentalization. The writer Oliver Burkeman describes the global economy as a "giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters -- the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”) -- in the service of future profit." [@burkeman-2021-four n.pag.]

The blooming of practice-research as part of the professionalisation of the arts in Western academies over the last 30 years means that artistic research is profoundly caught in this web of instrumentalisation. Practice-research predicated on short-term instrumentalization creates bodies in the service of hidden fires; the body as yet another resource to be consumed; the body as a technology. To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More published. More awarded. More promoted. These are bodies under stress that exhaust resources and colonise the future. These are bodies living in the short-term me-future. 

I, I, I. Me, me, me. My, my, my.

And under such conditions of stress, strain, and pressure, if we collapse into the various and shiny short-term futures that are always pulling us, cajoling us, haunting us, then I think we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as it is, and as a means to be a good ancestor. The body de-instrumentalised is radically in the present of awareness, and is not judged or massaged for other short-term future means. This is a body filled with the humility of its insignificance, while profoundly aware of bodies yet to be.

The question then that each of us must ask and understand deeply -- and then ask again, and understand differently -- is, what is the fundamental purpose of one's practice? 

And if your practice is body-based then the question becomes more specific: What is the fundamental purpose of this body in this practice?

Perhaps only then might we continue to understand and be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else, including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, and measured. These are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies to be swiped or scrolled. These are radically analogue bodies deep in non-judgmental awareness that are meeting and sensitive to deep time or the long now. These are bodies as stewards for those organisms yet to exist.

### Two descriptions

I'd like to describe two art project ideas -- one imagined, the other started -- that attempt to consider the body beyond its lifetime, and harness humility and responsibility, while not being built on hidden fires. Both are inspired by art works like Katie Paterson's _Future Library_ (2014) or Danny Hillis's _Clock of the Long Now_ (1999), or Walter de Maria's _The Lightning Field_ (1977). They are descriptions of practices or activities that are defined by not being able to be completed. They stretch into time beyond those we love and who love us. 

There is a haiku by the Japanese poet and Buddhist priest Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828). I include it here because some 300 years later it places side by side a simple physical practice that understands the hidden fires that sustain our unsustainable way of life. 

> In this world  
we walk on the roof of hell  
gathering blossoms.

#### Description 1: Custodians (imagined)

Perhaps you know of the Shinto shrine in Japan called Ise Jingū that has been torn down and rebuilt to the same design every 20 years for more than 1300 years. It is described as a "building forever new and forever ancient."[@krznaric-2021-good p.96]

Perhaps you've also thought about how cities are more than just fixed things that last for centuries; and that "in human terms they are never stable"[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] with people constantly arriving and leaving. According to Graeber and Wengrow a city is a place that is thought of -- or imagined to be -- a city because we humans "think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or [...] Calcuttans" or Melbournians.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 

These two things -- one an ancient re-building in Japan, the other a way of understanding the city as an imagined structure -- generated a simple idea for me. What kind of score could be created that mirrored these things? What kind of framework to be replaced or rebuilt every, say, 10 years? That through its cyclical destruction and reconstruction it might gather resilience and motility -- the capacity to absorb pressure, be ready for unseen and unknown stressors, and to be flexible. What if this _infrastructure_ were predicated on a literal and metaphorical body unable to be owned, a public body. What if one dance were to be performed at the same time in a specified place each year? That one body, one person, were responsible for organising this dance every year, for 10 years. To be a custodian of that dance for 10 years. What if, at that point, another custodian took over and rebuilt the same infrastructure and acted as a steward for another 10 years? And son on. One dance for the long now, with or without an audience. The smallest of footprints. How would this body be named?    

#### Description 2: This body (started)

This is the simplest of ideas that attempts to express how each of us is a humble steward for our bodies. Whenever I meet or see someone, I've been asking them a simple question. _What is your body to you?_ I then ask them to respond by starting with the words "This body".

_Meditation:_ What is your body to you? ("This body ...")

---

I would love for you to email yours to me in whichever language you choose: se@skellis.net. This would be a treasured gift and it would honour the work that I'm slowly starting to realise is my life. It's strange how a life sneaks up on you. Being young is most definitely poor practice for becoming old.

I like to imagine having a physical location to collect all these instances of _this body_, perhaps like the sociologist Niklas Luhmann's zettelkasten. Each instance of _This body_ would be a removable card: something to be held, to be touched, reflected on. Something that would not require any hidden fires to sustain it, but just a little bit of space in someone's home. People could visit it, photograph it, steal from it, add to it. Perhaps such a simple thing might be a way to become a good ancestor while paying attention to the smallness and profound humility of the human body.  

Here is a sample of what I have collected so far. [across 2 spaces]


Thank you. And thank you once again for giving me this tremendous honour to present to you this morning. It has been a pleasure and this body is most certainly humbled.
