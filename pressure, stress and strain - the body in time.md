### Title

Pressure, stress and strain: the body in time in practice-as-research

### Abstract

This is a shared screen desktop performance that explores the body under stress, and the role that artistic research practices might play in helping us understand the temporal scale of our fleeting, fragile and rapacious human bodies. Where so many body-based practices are predicated on nuanced and refined encounters with presence or awareness, what might the purpose of the body be in artistic research practices that extend through time? My grandmother, the artist Gladys Eastwood (1913-2005), used to joke that, "If you are going to have delusions, you may as well have delusions of grandeur." Indeed, it is easy to measure, admire or fetishise the grandeur of the human body's possibilities. But what if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? What then for how we steward the body in motion and the body under duress?

### Biography

Simon Ellis is an artist working with research practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now lives in London. He grew up in a politicised family environment where they often talked about things like human dignity, consumerism and even technology. These, in turn, have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. Simon also thinks a lot about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and likes to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

## keynote

### self-introduction: I am a body

Good morning everyone. It is an honour and a pleasure to be here with you this morning. In the last two years it has become hard for me to even imagine what it's like to be _with_ other people; and it's not so accurate to say I am _with_ you. Perhaps ... among? Around? Next to? I'm certainly not on the same screen as you. I suspect screens are the principle means by which we humans are atomised. Perhaps we are on the same cloud-based server? I am honoured to be on the same web server as you this morning. Actually I suspect that's not right either. I am honoured to be on Zoom at the same time as you. Let's go with that. 

My name is Simon Ellis and, just in case you are wondering ... I have a body, and this body is not just a head and shoulders.(add image of me as I am sitting there) 

That word _have_ in "I have a body" is strange isn't it? Like a possession. Like: I have a car; I have a washing machine; or I have a cat. If I were to say "I am a body" then, in English at least, it seems to diminish my agency or identity, as if I am _only_ a body. How would that idea translate? Into Cantonese? Italian? Farsi? People in dance use the word 'body' like this quite a bit -- as in "I want to work with some bodies", as if these bodies are merely instruments or abstractions with which to choreograph space and time. In dance, we also often talk about 'training our instrument', meaning, training our bodies. Language is so telling or instructive isn't it? Wittgenstein famously wrote that "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." (Ludwig Wittgenstein’s “Tractatus Logico Philosophicus,” published in 1921) And just in case you imagine me to have spent time reading Wittgenstein, I actually read that quote in Brene Brown's latest book. I feel no shame over this.

So in English when we say "I have a body" it's hard to shake this sense of it being something external that we have possession of. In their 2021 book called _The Dawn of Everything_, anthropologist David Graeber and archeologist David Wengrow describe the sacred quality of private property in historical European social thought, and how this sacred quality extends to ownership of our own bodies as a kind of human right. The Canadian political scientist C. B. Macpherson called this ‘possessive individualism’ in how we are thought to be the sole proprietors of our skills (and by extension our bodies), and how we owe nothing to society for them.(https://philosophy-question.com/library/lecture/read/274340-what-is-the-meaning-of-possessive-individualism)

In saying all this -- in this rather strange introduction -- you might have guessed that I am a dancer, and in an act of stating the most obvious of facts, this means I am interested in the body, in bodies, in your bodies, in my body, in the human body and indeed the bodies of animals. In that same book by Graeber and Wengrow they describe "extremely human activities" like "gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag] I love that dancing is up there with gossip and arguing as an extremely human activity. 

I make dance performances and films and I've been doing this for more than 30 years. They have all been tiny. Small scale. Insignificant. I am unheralded. Unheard of. Perhaps this is where human beings are most equal: in our complete cosmic insignificance. Perhaps Walt Whitman was wrong, and we are actually not large, and we do not contain multitudes. These performances I made were microscopic. No, that's not true, all were able to be seen with the naked eye although I like the idea of making literally microscopic dances. Each of these choreographies reflected my interests -- and the interests of the people I collaborated with -- at those times. They reveal the changes in my interests through my life as an artist, and the things that have not changed. (show stills). You might even say -- if you were being unkind -- that these choreographies were all really just about me. It's fine, by the way, if you'd like to be unkind. You can be unkind right there in the Zoom chat. Could there be a more contemporary way to start an online conference with some text-based trolling? 

The thing when you _are_ a body, and a body that performs, it's hard for choreographies not to be thought to be personal or about you (even if you don't want them to be). The emeritus professor of medicine and mindfulness Jon Kabat-Zinn describes how even the _not me story_ is the _story of me_.

What follows this morning is a guided tour or maybe even misguided tour of the body under pressure and in time. There will be a few diversions, a brief aside, perhaps even a dead-end if we are lucky. I make some claims, share some ideas, and propose something for us to consider in relation to experiences of stress, and what this might mean for artistic (and perhaps pedagogic) practices, including those that you describe as research. But at its heart this talk is about the kinds of things we make and for whom -- and for when -- they are made. add here about what being a 'me' (or an individual) might be in artistic practice if we think carefully about time. 

### a brief aside [.ptbrief]

There's an Artificial Intelligence theorist whose name is Eliezer Yudkowsky. He is also the founder of the rationalist website _LessWrong_. Yudkowsky is perhaps best known for creating the term "friendly artificial intelligence." In his formerly prolific blogging days he used to drop in what he called _meditations_. He describes these meditations as being like "puzzles"[@yudkowsky_useful_2012 n.p.] designed to help people remember the ideas in the writing. I'm going to steal Yudkowsky's idea at various moments in this presentation but with two different purposes in mind. The first is to recognise that time in this online space -- a webinar -- is experienced as a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances and limits. To give you space to rest your eyes, and to acknowledge that how I choreograph this space-time makes a difference to how you experience it. The second is to provoke specific reflections from you. Each _meditation_ will last just 1 minute, and each will give you a chance to rest, reflect, note, imagine, drift or engage as you prefer.

_Meditation 1:_ If a practice is something we do regularly or repeatedly then what is your practice? Not what you think it is, or what you want it to be, but what it actually is. 

Here's 1 minute. [timer.mp4]

### practice-research

At a certain point -- just over 20 years ago -- I started to integrate ideas about research into my dancing practice. I don't mean the commonplace kind of research that artists do into the subject of their work. For instance, if you were developing an artistic project about, say, climate change, then you'd do a whole lot of reading and background research into climate change. Your research would be a way for you to gather images, ideas, inspiration ... to become informed on the subject matter, while also stoking or loading your imagination. It's more like background information or work. I'm not talking about that kind of research -- like when funding organisations talk about 'research and development'. Not that there's anything wrong with this kind of research. Some of my best friends do research and development.  

I'm talking about: go to list (opportunity for meditation[^med] -- to interrupt me talking and to consider possibilities -- and use it fully [[making sense of dance research]]. This is what practice-as-research is. It is when we investigate ideas through artistic practices. It is not necessarily _about_ those practices (although it might be), but it is most definitely through those practices. 

### pressure, stress and strain

Tell story about Jim.
Placing these ideas on the table. They are a means by which to frame what will come. 

- neoliberalism? 
- cult of productivity (so much about producing -- and thereby consuming -- more stuff)
- can't talk about pressure, stress without talking about time (transition to next section)
- Geological time and pressure. The sense of time in the stress equation

- get stressed. becoming ghosts like bleached coral. Time of the body. How to describe an ecology of practice -- what balances and imbalances are in play? What powerful phenomena? What increased intensities? [[Magnason - On Time and Water#^9da54a]]

- everyday neoliberalism: unregulated hyper-individualism, loneliness, and the commodification of behaviour and thought.

> Here’s the problem in a nutshell: short-termism is built into the genetic code of the neoliberal paradigm that has come to dominate economic thought since it was unleashed on the world in the 1980s by the free-market ideology of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.[@krznaric-2021-good p.196]

"Neoliberalism offered the world an economic model that denied the reality of the future."[@krznaric-2021-good p.197]
- short terminism and neoliberalism pressure
- the pressure of producing. This. Now this. Now this. video of mouse on wheel. 

[hamster.mp4]

- Linear industrial design.

The rationalisation of decisions, ideas, and progress based solely on market-led thinking is a core principle of neoliberalism: “a widespread shift towards the uninhibited private market as the primary source of human advancement.” [Verdouw, Julia Joanne. “The Subject Who Thinks Economically? Comparative Money Subjectivities in Neoliberal Context.” Journal of Sociology 53, no. 3 (September 2017): 523–40. https://doi.org/10.1177/1440783316662717, p.524.]

Independence acts as a moral proxy for neoliberal faith in individualism and self-sufficiency; that each of us earns or does not earn our just deserts, and yet the more “we think of ourselves as self-made and self-sufﬁcient, the harder it is to learn gratitude and humility. And without these sentiments, it is hard to care for the common good.”[Sandel, Michael J. The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good? First published by Allen Lane. London: Allen Lane, an imprint of Penguin Books, 2020, n.pag.]

In The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good? Michael Sandel unpicks Western democracies’ faith in meritocracy as a cornerstone of neoliberal and global consumer capitalism. He describes how the meritocratic ethic is “corrosive of commonality” in how it celebrates the morality of freedom and autonomy through markets that “give people what they deserve.”  For Sandel, meritocracy is not a solution to inequality but a way to justify it. 

### zoom in: presence, body-based practices and now

(set up the paradox: two nows, and the future)

So far, in this presentation, all I've really stated is that we have a body. I hope we can agree on this. In this moment, it is a body sitting in front of a screen. It is a body under pressure ... physical, psychological, cultural. How does your body feel right now? Where does it feel right now? What are you noticing? (or a question like "what would you let go of? What weighs heavily on you that you might let go of?")

In dance and performance practices -- both in and outside of the University -- what do we artists do? We make performances. They are performances of enormously different scales, shapes, sizes, and colours. Sometimes they involve many many people, other times just a few (rarely just one, even when we call them "solos"). They are sometimes unpopular, sometimes popular -- although not nearly as culturally relevant as film or music. Sometimes they are under-developed, sometimes over-cooked, sometimes successful, sometimes not (however you might imagine 'success' to be gauged) They express ideas, they captivate, they alienate, they distract, they are didactic, they are open to interpretation. In dance -- or at least in so much of dance -- they are people moving (sometimes to music, sometimes not). It's absurd to attempt to characterise the set of global artistic practices that might fall under the banner of 'dance' or 'performance' as I've just done. So forgive me my hubris. But I'd like to propose that one thing all dance (perhaps all performance including theatre and opera) has in common -- from social dancing, to artistic dancing -- is a concern or deep curiosity about something we call "presence." That _being present_ is an essential part of performance, and somehow that not being present is a bad thing, or something to be avoided. It's the opposite of blanking. (so useful that word -- if presence is non-judgemental awareness, then blanking is hyper-judgemental )

Nevertheless, most products -- including performances -- can be (perhaps cynically) summed up as "take, make, use, lose."[Kate Raworth, in @krznaric-2021-good p.206] We take the Earth's materials, make them into things we want or like, use them a bit (or present them), and then they are discarded or lost. This is not to say that they don't produce some value: pleasure ...

- use of resources in performing arts / spectacles.

You can imagine the tension or contradiction between such a mode of production, and a set of artistic practices bound to some idea of presence.  

Take. Make. Use. Lose. But, oh, don't forget, be present. 

The almost exclusively linear model of production in dance and performance is increasingly disheartening, and unsustainable. Each choreography, each performance seem to take longer and longer to make (and to use more and more resources), but is seen or presented less and less. The feeling of running to stand still is stronger and stronger, and certainly the economics no longer add up, if they ever did. Perhaps it's not surprising that I've moved increasingly towards process-oriented body-based practices, and I've done this for a number of reasons: i) my aging body -- it is physically capable of less. In case you were wondering, this is also called trying to make a virtue out of necessity; ii) sense of disillusionment with making and making and making for outcomes that were gone, often after only 2 or 3 performances; iii) deeper and deeper engagement with research through practice; iv) desire to seek practices that don't fit or make sense in current models of production. 

By process-oriented body-bases practices, I mean things like somatics that distinguish the body as observed from the outside -- the body as spectacle or as it is seen, oculocentric -- versus the soma as perceived from the inside. This distinction between inner and outer worlds, between what can be seen and what can only be felt is an important one. It is perhaps even radical given just how visually oriented human beings are in a world of TikTok (etc), and that body-based practices like somatics seem to resist so many of the tropes of the body under pressure: pressure to take, pressure to make, pressure to use, pressure to lose. The pressures of production.

If I consider body-based practices with respect to the conditions and history of practice-research, then such practices are vital for five reasons. First, they have a complex and often fraught relationship with language. That is, how does language function (in a descriptive or analytical way) with these practices? Limited. Second, as I've just said, the experiential nuances are not seen but felt. Third, these practices intersect with contested issues of so-called embodied knowledge and tacit awareness. That is, when doing these practices, how might we recognise what is understood by the practitioners, and how that understanding changes with practice? Fourth, these practices complicate decades-old problems in practice-research to do arts practices that are ephemeral (or that 'disappear') and how they might be documented, and how they even resist documentation. Fifth, and finally, they ask us to slow down. They introduce "slack time"[@munger-2021-it n.pag], a chance to adjust ourselves to different experiences of the unfolding of time. 

- [[weber-fechner law]] - and compare with [[Magnason - On Time and Water#Back in time]] -- slow slow slow down. 

But what kinds of practices am I talking about? Feldenkrais, Alexander technique, BMC, ideokinesis, Skinner Release Technique. One other is the oddly named Authentic Movement. 
It affords a body-based process of empirical (visible) and sensorial (non-visible) observation. Authentic Movement can be thought of as a contemplative practice, a set of processes in which we practice "the timeless present we call now" [Kabat Zinn, Mindfulness of the body as a whole, 13min, app); where we breathe out of clock time and into non-judgemental awareness. And this is what I understand the practice of presence to be in the performing arts: non-judgemental awareness. It's the keystone of the performing arts, perhaps experienced most commonly in many different circumstances by the term "flow."

In 2019 the dancer-choreographer Shaun McLeod and I worked together with the movement practice called Authentic Movement. What can be said about what happened in that space during those six weeks of practice? If all of us here had been there what would we all have heard and/or seen that we could agree on?

One person -- the mover -- had their eyes closed. The other person -- the watcher -- was watching the mover. The watcher was also holding a smartphone _directed_ towards the mover, but was not paying attention to the phone's screen. A phone hyphen camera is not a regular part of Authentic Movement and you may or may not know that.

The mover moved around the space; sometimes this was more like a series of stillnesses, other times it was everyday: like walking or sitting. Still other times the mover might do things that were a little less everyday. These movements were sometimes strung together; most of us in this room would call that -- or recognise it as -- contemporary dance, or maybe somatically informed contemporary dance if we were being a bit fancy. But it was definitely not the kind of contemporary dance I've seen on "So You Think You Can Dance". [expand: so.mp4] I would say the mover looked a little like they were _feeling_ or _sensing_, maybe _looking inside_. But I couldn't be sure, and nor do I think we would agree on this.

It turns out that the smartphone was taking a photograph every 30 seconds, and the screen was darkened so the watcher wouldn't know when a photo was being taken nor how anything might be framed in the lens of the camera. 

Here is a set of photos from one 20 minute Authentic Movement session with Shaun as the mover. [expand: 31shaun.jpg]]

This collection of photos is the visual remains of the practice. It is thirty-one photos, randomly framed, systematically taken and turned into a collection -- as if to seem complete. The strip is probably quite rich compared with how I've just verbally described what was happening in the studio. We can see the room, positions on the floor, clothing, the light, postures, hints of gestures, expressions. But an enormous quantity of experiential data have not made it from what was in the room to what you can see here. 

We can also infer some things from these photos, the most seductive being what kind of movement occurred. But we are _inferring_ movement, and by that I mean _implying_. We'd also be inferring understanding, and we would be inferring the presence or absence of this thing that gets called _embodied knowledge_. Even if these images were replaced by video ... still be inferring. It would still be 

I think his concept of resolution is useful, even if I am robbing him of his thinking that was written for a particular context in a particular field. My digital theft of de Sousa Santos' thinking is to remind us that when we are dealing with body-based practices what we can observe bears little or no relationship to the experiential complexity of what happened. That is, we have high resolution experiences, and low resolution representations of those experiences. And that gap applies irrespective of how fancy our technocratic solutions are to the problem of archiving movement and choreography.

High fidelity. Low fidelity. Granularity. 
To go deeper into that which cannot be observed. 

- see also [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]
Perhaps it's not surprising that these kinds of practices like authentic movement seem to mirror mindfulness strategies (and growing industry of mindfulness in the West -- McMindfulness).  But also a way to cope. To cope with the pressure of neoliberalism. 

- constraint/limitation of PaR -- oriented towards the self (and often solo practices)

I am proposing that we must seek methods of making that distill production from consumption; that our work is to pry apart the discombobulating effects of performing to be seen, and to do this in plain sight. I understand dance, and perhaps all of the performing arts, to be a small enough field -- and collection of practices -- to interrogate and resist the logic of production predicated on consumption. In contemporary dance we have talked about such resistance for years as a community but as dance has become more and more visible on social media and the "immediacy of appropriation"[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30], the temptation is to celebrate these days in the sun, and turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] 

Not to do this in order to ... that understanding its purpose (including the possibility it has no purpose) is one's only task. When shift from that you are serving something or someone else. Not because of what it might bring me, but because of the ideas themselves. No utility. It is the body "in the service of" that creates the pressure and stress. but humility??

I understand this to be vitally important work. That non-judgemental awareness is a _unit_ of our experience, perhaps even the means to our experience. One of its paradoxes is how it makes it possible for the self to fall away. That the language of I I I, me me me, my my my is rendered obsolete, or has no place in non-judgemental awareness. 

I must be careful here. I think it's too easy to conflate two types of _now_. One seems to be an obsession with now that distracts us from the past or the future. This is what Bateson calls:

> "the great irony of our time is that even as we are living longer, we are thinking shorter.” This is the age of the tyranny of the now.[Mary Catherine Bateson, in @krznaric-2021-good pp.4-5]

> Quick now, here, now, always—  
> Ridiculous the waste sad time  
> Stretching before and after. 

-- TS Eliot, Four Quartets
Seems like a nowness that is an [[obsession with generating noise]] - vs signal

Make no mistake, Presence = non judgemental awareness. It's the opposite of distraction. There is now with time as kairos, and the now in which time as chronos, unfelt as it is smothered by distraction and the streams of algorithmically delivered images

Distinct from The timeless quality of the present moment. I see this as a kind of paradox of time (or scale and time?). The one version of 'now' voids the past, present and future. The other harnesses the present to expand our understanding, experience and imagination of the past and the future. 

That is, like Heidegger described, our being is bound to finite time. Rather than having time, we are time. (this based on [@burkeman-2021-four Chapter 3 Facing Finitude: Thrown into Time, n.pag.])

### zoom out: artistic practices for the future

#### Being out of touch

What became clear, even in the earliest days of the pandemic, was that touching others -- making physical contact with others -- was under direct and immediate pressure to change. We went from people who touch each other all of the time (in different circumstances, conventions and situations) to a species that avoided touch. We avoided touch to protect ourselves and to protect others. For some, this was a kind of relief; for others not at all. We became out of touch.

To be _out of touch_ in English of course means to be disconnected or out of date. As if we have no remaining touch left. "Sorry I'm all out of touch. I have no touch left to give." The way in which middle-aged people become out of touch with the culture and language of young people. As in: That guy is so out of touch. Not up to speed. Disconnected. Not with it. To no longer be able to 'read the room' because the room has moved on beyond one's grasp.

Yet we felt the pressure to stay connected or be in touch. We experienced -- and likely still experience -- zoom fatigue. A kind of hyper-connectivity made possible by 21st century technologies. We were desperate to stay in touch while knowing deep down in our zoom-fatigued bodies that we also remained deeply out of touch. Touch was dangerous. Touch was certainly no longer innocent (was it ever?)

I started (and continue) to get the sense that this work was out of touch. That all this work. Disconnected. 

Trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, rapacious human body. Pressure. Force. Stress. Strain. That when I start to reflect critically on the work I'm doing, and while taking into account the scale of time, of individualism, of now-ness, of personal ambition, and most pressing of all the climate emergency, I start to wonder, what might a body-based practice be in the long now? In deep time? as if "blinded by the excess of clarity" [@merton-1954-elected p.30] with respect to what is now commonly -- but not officially in the geologic time scale -- referred to as the anthropocene: 

> a proposed geological epoch dating from the commencement of significant human impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems, including, but not limited to, anthropogenic climate change. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene)

- [[Magnason - On Time and Water#The god in the steam engine]] -- about hiding fire. To create practices not built on fire (as best as possible). Not because this will make one difference to the numbers. But rather because it changes culture. 

Another way of being out of touch is about the invisible fires of the anthropocene.

Limitation. Narrow the attention. The resources. To touch the earth and our bodies on it lightly. But what do I mean by _scale of time?_

more like a hobby --to resist the compression of time through neoliberal (eye-roll) pressure. https://seths.blog/2022/01/generative-hobbies/
#### The game of people you will love

There's a simple game to play. I first read about it in Andri Snaer Magnason's _On Time and Water_. The game is to answer the question: "When is someone you will love still going to be alive?"[@magnason-2021-time p.308]

Here's my version. My grandmother, Gladys Eastwood, was born in December 1913. Here she is singing. Gladys gave birth to my mother, Gabrielle Eastwood-Ellis, in 1937. Here she is in 1960. I was born in 1968, and here I am in about 1973. My niece Rebecca was born in 1980; and Rebecca's daughter -- my great niece -- Zoe Ellis-Craig was born in 2016. If we imagine that Zoe lives until she is 90 then this would mean she would die in 2106. 

Gladys: 1913 - 2005
Gabrielle: 1937 - 2021
Simon: 1968 - 
Rebecca: 1980 - 
Zoe: 2016 - 

That is 193 years of people I have loved and who have loved me. 193 years. This small, insignificant, delicate body extended through time, and "beyond the ego boundary of [my] own mortality".[@krznaric-2021-good pp.14-15] This body's hopes, dreams, traumas, desires, and limitations; its 206 discrete bones, 650 or so muscles, and 100 billion neurons. This a body that counts. These are the bodies that count. 

Magnason describes it like this: 

> [This is the] time you can touch with your own hands. Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds you. And your time is also the time of the people you *will* know and love. The time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future every single day.’[@magnason-2021-time p.309]

#### To be a good ancestor

There's another version of this game in which you imagine yourself to be that last person you know who will love you -- in this case my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig -- and write a letter to yourself as if you were that person. Might she describe me as a good ancestor? That these practices of performance, dance and film are insignificant compared with how I stepped on the planet so that I might have been a good ancestor for Zoe Ellis-Craig. (video of her?) Will she judge my life as "laughable and foolish"[@magnason-2021-time p.259] or recognise how I squandered resource after resource making dances about myself ;-)? That even the not me dances were really the me dances. 

Concept of good ancestor. There was a man called Jonas Salk. He looked like this. Salk died in 1995, and he was an American virologist and medical researcher most famous for one single thing: the development of the polio vaccine. 

> The most important question we must ask ourselves is, "Are we being good ancestors?" So said Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine in 1953 but refused to patent it--forgoing profit so that more lives could be saved. Salk's radical generosity to future generations should inspire us. But when leading philosopher Roman Krznaric examines society today, he sees just the opposite: Our short term, exploitative mindsets have "colonized the future." (The Good Ancestor blurb)

> Is there an ideal time horizon to which we should aspire in the tug-of-war against short-termism? This book proposes a hundred years as a minimum threshold for long-term thinking. This is the current length of a long human lifespan, taking us beyond the ego [p.15] boundary of our own mortality so we begin to imagine futures that we can influence yet not participate in ourselves.[@krznaric-2021-good pp.14-15]

> An essential starting point is to develop a sense of deep-time humility, where we grasp the insignificance of our own transitory existence in relation to the vast time frame of cosmic history, freeing our minds to look both far into the past and beyond our lifetimes into a distant future. We must accept the reality that our personal stories from birth to death, and all the achievements and tragedies of human civilization, will barely register in the annals of cosmological time.[@krznaric-2021-good p.39]

> The Arrow concerns the extent to which we are responsible for the future consequences of our actions. One of its best-known formulations appears in the writing of philosopher Derek Parfit:
> >Remoteness in time has, in itself, no more significance than remoteness in space. Suppose that I shoot some arrow into a distant wood, where it wounds some person. If I should have known that there might be someone in this wood, I am guilty of gross negligence. Because this person is far away, I cannot identify the person whom I harm. But this is no excuse. Nor is it any excuse that this person is far away. We should make the same claims about effects on people who are temporally remote.18 [@krznaric-2021-good p.81]
- these are bodies under pressure: the bodies of the future, organisms of the future. They are out of sight, and out of mind these bodies under pressure. Their futures are being colonized by our present. 

> Paleontologist Tim Flannery puts it even more starkly, describing our rapacious species as “the future eaters.”6 [@krznaric-2021-good p.141]

"sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment" (Rumi)
- could be stewardship of other (future) bodies

“Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived notion, follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or you shall learn nothing.” - Huxley

> Suzuki recognizes that seeing humans as interdependent with the living world lies at the heart of the seventh-generation principle. The environment is not something “out there”; as he puts it, “we are the environment.” We are connected to the landscape, just as we are to future generations, through the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the soil in which we grow our food.
> The oxygen we breathe in, for instance, circulates in our blood-stream and around half remains in our lungs, so there is no clear line separating where the air ends and we begin. When we exhale, our breath mixes with the air and is taken in by other people, birds, mammals, and reptiles. “If I am air and you are air, then I am you,” writes Suzuki. But the atoms in the air also persist through time. According to one study, there are 3 x 1019 (three followed by nineteen zeros) argon atoms in a breath of air. These quintillions of atoms are continually being blown around the planet, so wherever you are, you will breathe in around 15 argon atoms that you breathed in a year earlier. And that’s not all. Each breath we take contains argon atoms that were probably once inhaled by Cleopatra and Gautama Buddha, and will be breathed in by our descendants seven generations from today. “Air,” says Suzuki, plays an essential role “linking all life in a single matrix, and joining past, present and future in a single flowing entity.”32 [@krznaric-2021-good p.88]

Whitman was right after all. We do contain multitudes. 

To de-instrumentalise the body. It's not a body FOR this or that thing. It is a body that is. It is a body under stress. Under pressure. It is not a body under pressure in order for something else to happen: justice, etc. professionalisation of arts through PaR creates this danger quite explicitly. It creates bodies in the service of. The body as yet another resource to be consumed. These are bodies under stress. Body as a tool - a technology - to "as a tool for assuaging my own anxiety" (4000 weeks). To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More awarded. A body radically in the present - not judged for another(future) means. 

PaR - expansion. Blossoming. Products. Professionalisation. Neoliberalism. 

The purpose of this body, under these conditions is to be this body under these conditions. These are the practices, the researches in which we resist temptation to make it a body under these conditions in order to be a body under other (instrumental) conditions. To write/understand that body as it was, this body as it is. The question then, is, what is the purpose of this body in this practice? That to understand it's purpose or purposes is to start to enter deeply the mangle of practice (pickering. That even under the worst conditions of stress, pain, and pressure, if we look to the future or futures then we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as a territory. That those futures are only maps. Useful, interesting, but partial, flawed and red herrings. The research is in the body as territory 

Resist with all our hearts the instrumental and future-focused way. That industrial PAR will do this. Industrial performing arts will do this. In order to do or get this I must do this. It's living in the future 

> Admittedly, it’s not entirely our own fault that we approach our finite time in such a perversely instrumental and future-focused way. Powerful external pressures push us in this direction, too, because we exist inside an economic system that is instrumentalist to its core. One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit. (4000 weeks)

That we find or be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else (including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, measured, etc). They are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies (the ultimate body to be swiped, or scrolled). These Are Radically analogue bodies in now. that are meeting and sensitive to deep time / long now.

### Two propositions

(one imagined, the other started)

Inspired by The clock of the long now. 
Katie Paterson in [[Krznaric - The Good Ancestor#^addf96]]
Others.

Haiku by Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828): (was a Japanese poet and lay Buddhist priest)

In this world  
we walk on the roof of hell  
gathering blossoms.

> who do we think of, when we use the pronoun “we”? And I want my “we” to be absolutely continuous amongst my fellow humans, amongst living beings, amongst the largeness of the expanding universe, down to the tiniest physics and particle. -- Jane Hirshfield (https://onbeing.org/programs/jane-hirshfield-the-fullness-of-things/#)

> nothing we produce can hold a candle to the ocean itself, nothing is as magnificent as a glacier,[p.260] nothing so mysterious as a rainforest at night. Nothing we have done will be considered remarkable if achieving it has meant closing our eyes to science and throwing away the life and happiness of future generations.[@magnason-2021-time pp.259-260]

So, yes, just collecting blossoms while acknowledging the heat from below. to make something for the future that is not about legacy. That we thought about them. We paid them attention, even as continued to suck fossil fuels out of the ground. 

_Conditions for these proposals:_

- atelic
- intrinsic (not dependent on extrinsic resources -- care for externalities)
- body is present (why?)
- minimal footprint

They are practices that are defined by not being able to be completed (see Eno essay). Their ontology is to be ongoing. Work that goes on. That is followed. They stretch into time the way those we love and who love us:

> Taking a walk in the countryside, like listening to a favorite song or meeting friends for an evening of conversation, is thus a good example of what the philosopher Kieran Setiya calls an “atelic activity,” meaning that its value isn’t derived from its telos, or ultimate aim. You shouldn’t be aiming to get a walk “done”; nor are you likely to reach a point in life when you’ve accomplished all the walking you were aiming to do. “You can stop doing these things, and you eventually will, but you cannot complete them,” Setiya explains. They have “no outcome whose achievement exhausts them and therefore brings them to an end.” And so the only reason to do them is for themselves alone: “There is no more to going for a walk than what you are doing right now.” (4000 weeks)

Atelic: Presenting an action or event as being incomplete. (Is a hobby!) But there's a lie here isn't there? But in recognising the difference we are changed. Our bodies are changed. The pressures are changed. 

> We need more lithium today, and merely hope to find greater reserves—or a suitable replacement—tomorrow. This revaluation has the effect of shifting the place of the natural order from something intrinsic to our practices to something extrinsic. The whole of nature becomes what economists tellingly call an _externality_.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

#### The steward

> Ise Jingū, Japan
> A Shinto shrine that has been torn down and rebuilt to exactly the same design every 20 years since 690 CE. A building forever new and forever ancient.[@krznaric-2021-good p.96]

- what kind of framework for an practice like this. One in which the infrastructure is replaced every 20 years. What might we understand by infrastructure in this case? That in its cyclical destruction and construction is gathers resilience and mobility: the capacity to absorb contemporary pressure, be ready for unseen and unknown stressors, and to be flexible.  
- resilience of body under pressure
- infrastructure of a shared body; a body unable to be owned, a public body. Or perhaps it's a name ... dance of the long now. _Custodians_. To do one dance a year at a specific time and place. How would this body be named? It does not even need an audience. 
- Flexibility, absorbing strain, lightness 
- infrastructure with the long now in mind. So different from the short now. 

> Cities are tangible things. Certain elements of their physical infrastructure – walls, roads, parks, sewers – might remain fixed for hundreds or even thousands of years; but in human terms they are never stable. People are constantly moving in and out of them, whether permanently, or seasonally for holidays and festivals, to visit relatives, trade, raid, tour around, and so on; or just in the course of their daily rounds. Yet cities have a life that transcends all this. This is not because of the permanence of stone or brick or adobe; neither is it because most people in a city actually meet one another. It is because they will often think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or Muscovites or Calcuttans.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 
- a practice more akin to a city? It is a thing that depends on certain characteristics. Hong Kong. geography, history, architecture. 

> In other words, from the perspective of someone living in an ancient city, the city itself was not so entirely different from earlier landscapes of clans or moieties that extended across hundreds of miles. It was a structure raised primarily in the human imagination, which allowed for the possibility of amicable relations with people they had never met.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]

> The particular mix depended largely on where in the world the cities happened to be, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that history’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]
- a practice with small footprint 
- Of all my privileges, this one -- to be able to imagine futures beyond my current needs -- is one that seems vital to take advantage of.


#### This body

> By understanding as a full-body phenomenon the consciousness that lenses our view of reality and shapes our life-experience, we can not only become better stewards of our own bodies and of the planet we share with other bodies, human and nonhuman, but we can begin to dismantle the artificial hierarchies and categories by which we have long bolstered our creaturely centrality across the various scales and spectra of existence, from Ptolemism to anthropocentrism to racism, choosing instead to be both humbled and hallowed by the evolutionary wonder of consciousness.

Recently, whenever I meet or see someone, I've been asking them a simple question. What is your body to you? I then ask them to respond by starting with the words "This body" (or however that may be translated into their mother language). For instance, in Italian, it would be "Questo corpo".

Note how I started with "I have a body". Ownership.

Meditation.

I would love for you to email yours to me -- in whichever language you choose. Or even just put them in the chat. This would be a beautiful gift and it would honour me.

I like to imagine having a physical location to collect all these instances of _this body_, perhaps like Nichlas Luhrman's zettelkasten or slipboxes (image). Like the analogue library catalogues I remember from my youth. Each instance a removable card: something to be held, to be touched, reflected on. Something that long after my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig is dead, some time after 2106, would not require any hidden fires to sustain it, but just a little bit of space in someone's home. People could visit it, photograph it, steal from it, add to it. Perhaps such a simple thing might be a way to become a good ancestor while paying attention to the smallness of the human body.  

Here is a sample of what I have collected so far.  

This body is aging
This body makes things possible 
This body is constantly reinventing itself 
This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies 
This body knows how to walk, run and dance
This body is not like the others
This body feels
This body is wounded 
This body sees and is seen
This body has buried the bodies of others 
This body adapts
This body has been exploited 
This body cannot be known
This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard". 
This body is at a loss
This body houses these feelings 
This body is consciousness and self-knowing 
This body cannot escape technology
This body is unknown and cannot be known
This body is bleeding
This body is technological.
This body is broken
This body is a time-traveler
This body is overwhelmed by detail 
This body is the place through which experiences flood 
This body is where I need to go
This body belongs to this mind
This body trusts you
This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory 
This body is in pain
This body has no boundary
This body has betrayed me. 
This body is worthy of trust. 
This body is mine (Lee Miller, 20220108)
This body is not far from death and I am not afraid
This body will die
This body humbles me over and over again

Thank you. And thank you once again for being given this tremendous honour to present these ideas to you this morning. It has been a pleasure and this body is most certainly humbled.

### unused meditations

This is the body that takes the time it needs to take. I think this is body based PaR. A body under consideration that takes the time it needs to take. 

Q (for meditation?): what is the role of "control" and "force" in such a body?

Meditation: what is the role of patience in your work and research? What (if anything) does it have to do with originality? 

Meditation: when to admit to not-knowing? That the territory is unattainable. That paradox lies at the heart of research. 

### uncertain / possible

> ‘Societies’, wrote Mauss, ‘live by borrowing from each other, but they define themselves rather by the refusal of borrowing than by its acceptance.’14[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 5, n.pag.]
- paradox of artistic research is desire for originality/uniqueness ... to be different. To stamp one's identity on an artistic work. Define ourselves by refusal of borrowing. But how to live? Openly borrow. System of exchange. 
- perhaps schismogenesis is useful as well: "a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals." (from wiki)
- sonder -- useful?

And what is my warrant in making these claims? What right do I have to suggest such things? I will let you decide depending on their value to you.

- I am performing for a camera like we have all been performing for camera these last two years. my armpits are sweaty. it's not even 2am local time. 

some kind of map to orient the listener/viewer?

Kind of opposite to Brand's stuff in lithium. To slow down the art. To wrestle it from the culture of rapidity. 

- Ketamine. To render another body useless. 

Wade Davis' idea of ethnosphere (p.219 of Krznaric).

it might be I need to talk about compression -- [[lossy compression and the mythical core of culture]] -- to think through pragmatics of information?? (seems like a distraction.)

Any Damasio useful re consciousness and awareness?

"Entering space and time completely" - von Franz [in @burkeman-2021-four]

Quality of the questioning. The questions lack precision. They are more like drag nets. Capturing all. What is the risk in the precision? To narrow attention. I don't have evidence of this. It's a feeling. Perhaps a proposition. 

- domestication -- requires human intervention (else it dies). opposite of this for PaR and the body. The danger of domestication. Keeping it wild. The lightest of touches. But also narrowing and being specific. (re questions).

Mum: I can't believe it happened so quickly. It took precisely as long as it needed. But ...

> As Milton Friedman put it, while a crisis provides the opportunity for change, “when that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.”28 The tragedy of the 2008 financial crisis was that there was no obvious alternative economic vision on offer.[@krznaric-2021-good p.114]

What does it mean to go slow? Consider that word. P155 of Time and Water - about plastic. Must must slow down. 

> In a world where changes in many areas have been exponential, there have been more changes in the last decade than in the entire twentieth century. Around the year 2000, roughly fifty-eight million cars were produced annually in the world; now it is a hundred million a year. Half of all the plastic produced in the world came into existence after 2000.[@magnason-2021-time p.155]

> To recognize the close parallels between private property and notions of the sacred is also to recognize what is so historically odd about European social thought. Which is that – quite unlike free societies – we take this absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human rights and freedoms. This is what the political scientist C. B. Macpherson meant by ‘possessive individualism’. Just as every man’s home is his castle, so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the idea that you own your own body, just as you own your chattels and possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or house, or car, and so on.53 As we’ve seen, those who did not share this particular European conception of the sacred could indeed be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned – and, from Amazonia to Oceania, they often were. [@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag.]

- possessive individualism. Macpherson _Political Theory of Possessive Individualism_ (1962) (talks about negative rights versus positive rights, see footnote 53 in Graeber)

> One vivid example of how the capitalist pressure toward instrumentalizing your time saps meaning from life is the notorious case of corporate lawyers. 

>Seeing things this way helps explain the otherwise mysterious truth that rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable. They’re very good at instrumentalizing their time, for the purpose of generating wealth for themselves; that’s the definition of being successful in a capitalist world. But in focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness. And so their days are sapped of meaning, even as their bank balances increase. (4000 weeks)

They feel different. I can feel the difference now. Typing while on my bed. I am quite into this. Deep in thought, in reading. I am in the process of coming to understand what to present and how.

> "Because children grow up, we think a child’s purpose is to grow up,” Herzen says. “But a child’s purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn’t disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment…Life’s bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.” -- 4000 weeks. 

Like that Zizek who talked about checking out.

> [Heidegger's] answer is that our being is totally, utterly bound up with our finite time. So bound up, in fact, that the two are synonymous: to be, for a human, is above all to exist temporally, in the stretch between birth and death, certain that the end will come, yet unable to know when. We tend to speak about our having a limited amount of time. But it might make more sense, from Heidegger’s strange perspective, to say that we are a limited amount of time. That’s how completely our limited time defines us.[@burkeman-2021-four Chapter 3 Facing Finitude: Thrown into Time, n.pag.]

> Most of the products you will see—from socks to smartphones to cotton balls to deodorant—are made through an old-fashioned linear model of industrial design that Kate Raworth sums up as “take, make, use, lose.”  We take Earth’s materials, make them into things we want, use them for a while—sometimes only once—and then throw them away. And it is this linear degenerative economic model that pushes us over the brink of planetary boundaries.26 [@krznaric-2021-good p.206]
- like performance creations?? 

> Kirk explained that there are two ways to make a map: actual exploration to collect your own data, and using data provided by other people. Either way, maps are about layers. If you’re using existing data, you might start with elevation, then use a different set of data to layer on roads, then perhaps use hydrography data to find the lakes, streams, and rivers, and so on. He helped me understand that while different maps may use different layers, the one thing that all maps do is provide readers with orientation.[@brown-2021-atlas Introduction>You are here, n.pag.]
