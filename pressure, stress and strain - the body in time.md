# pressure, stress and strain - the body in time

## conference details
Conference Title: Harnessing a 21st Century Approach to Performing Arts: Technology Practice, Education & Research.

### Title

Pressure, stress and strain: the body in time in practice-as-research

### Abstract

This is a shared screen desktop performance that explores the body under stress, and the role that artistic research practices might play in helping us understand the temporal scale of our fleeting, fragile and rapacious human bodies. Where so many body-based practices are predicated on nuanced and refined encounters with presence or awareness, what might the purpose of the body be in artistic research practices that extend through time? My grandmother, the artist Gladys Eastwood (1913-2005), used to joke that, "If you are going to have delusions, you may as well have delusions of grandeur." Indeed, it is easy to measure, admire or fetishise the grandeur of the human body's possibilities. But what if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? What then for how we steward the body in motion and the body under duress?

### Biography
Simon Ellis is an artist working with research practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now lives in London. He grew up in a politicised family environment where they often talked about things like human dignity, consumerism and even technology. These, in turn, have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. Simon also thinks a lot about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and likes to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

## keynote

### biography: I am a body

Good morning everyone. I am honoured to be here with you this morning. Well, not _with_ you, but ... among? Around? Next to? I'm certainly not on the same screen as you. Perhaps on the same cloud-based server? I am honoured to be on the same server as you this morning. Actually I suspect that's not right either. I am honoured to be on Zoom at the same time as you. Let's go with that. Sometimes it's hard for me to even imagine what it's like to be _with_ other people.

My name is Simon Ellis and, just in case you are wondering ... I have a body, and this body is not just a head and shoulders. That word _have_ in "I have a body" is strange isn't it? Like a possession. Like: I have a car; I have a washing machine; or I have a cat. If I were to say "I am a body" then, in English at least, it seems to diminish my agency or identity, as if I am _only_ a body. How would that idea translate? Into Cantonese? Italian? Farsi? People in dance use the word 'body' like this quite a bit -- as in "I want to work with some bodies", as if these bodies are merely instruments with which to choreograph space and time. In dance, we often talk about 'training our instrument', meaning, our bodies. Language is so telling or instructive isn't it? Wittgenstein famously wrote that "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world."

In saying all this, you might have guessed that I am a dancer. Recently, I read a book that described "extremely human activities as gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure."[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag] I love that dancing is up there with gossip and arguing as an extremely human activity. But probably not the kind of dancing I was trained in. 

I make dance performances and films and I've been doing this for more than 30 years. They have all been tiny. Small scale. Insignificant. I am unheralded. Unheard of. Perhaps Walt Whitman was wrong, and I am not large, and I do not contain multitudes. These performances were microscopic. No, that's not true, all were able to be seen with the naked eye although I like the idea of making literally microscopic dances. Each of these choreographies in my past reflected my interests -- and the interests of the people I collaborated with -- at the time. They reveal the changes in my interests through my life as an artist, and the things that have remained. (show stills). You might even say -- if you were being unkind -- that they were all really just about me. It's fine if you'd like to be unkind. You can be unkind right there in the Zoom chat -- I'll weep over it later. That's the thing when you _are_ a body, and a body that performs, it's hard for those choreographies not to be personal or about you (even if you don't want them to be). 

### practice-research

At a certain point -- just over 20 years ago -- I started to integrate ideas about research into my dancing practice. I don't mean the commonplace kind of research that artists do into the subject of their work. For instance, if you were developing an artistic project about, I don't know, climate change, then you'd do a whole lot of reading and background research into climate change. Your research would be a way for you to gather images, ideas, inspiration ... to become informed on the subject matter, while also stoking or loading your imagination. It's more like background information or work. I'm not talking about that kind of research -- like when we say 'research and development'. Not that there's anything wrong with this kind of research. Some of my best friends do research and development.  

I'm talking about: go to list (opportunity for meditation -- to interrupt me talking and to consider possibilities -- and use it fully [[making sense of dance research]]. This is what practice-as-research is. It is when we investigate ideas through artistic practices. It is not necessarily _about_ those practices (although it might be), but it is most definitely through those practices.

### The game of people we loved and were loved by

There's a simple game to play; it's a game based on people we loved and were loved by. I first read about it in Andri Snaer Magnason _On Time and Water_. 

> When is someone you will love still going to be alive?[@magnason-2021-time p.308]

> That’s the length of time you connect, more than 250 years. The time you can touch with your own hands. Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds you. And your time is also the time of the people you will know and love. The time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future every single day.’[@magnason-2021-time p.309]

The game of people we loved and were loved by. Gladys. Recording of her singing? Zoe. Delusions of grandeur. 1913 (2005) - 1937 (2021) - 1968 - 1980 - 2016 - 2106
Just give generations, two of which are dead.

There's another version of this game in which you imagine yourself to be that last person you know who loved you -- in this case my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig -- and write a letter to yourself from that person. Might she describe me as a good ancestor? That these practices of performance, dance and film are insignificant compared with how I stepped on the planet so that I might have been a good ancestor for Zoe Ellis-Craig. (video of her?) Will she judge my life as "laughable and foolish"[@magnason-2021-time p.259] or recognise how I squandered resource after resource making dances about myself ;-)?

250 years. This body extended through time. It's traumas, hopes, dreams, desires, limitations, number of bones, number of muscles. 




[[Magnason - On Time and Water#^f0cae3]] -- purposelessness. Focus on the empty. But to build these practices so that they touch the earth lightly. 



What became clear, even in the earliest days of the pandemic, was that touching others -- making physical contact with others -- was under direct and immediate pressure to change. We went from people who touch each other all of the time (in different circumstances, conventions and situations) to a species that avoided touch. We avoided touch to protect ourselves and to protect others. For some, this was a kind of relief; for others not at all. We became out of touch.

To be _out of touch_ in English of course means to be disconnected or out of date. As if we have no remaining touch left. "Sorry I'm all out of touch. I have no touch left to give." The way in which middle-aged people become out of touch with the culture and language of young people. That guy is so out of touch. Not up to speed. Disconnected. Not with it. To no longer be able to 'read the room.'

Yet we felt the pressure to stay connected or be in touch. We experienced -- and likely still experience -- zoom fatigue. A kind of hyper-connectivity made possible by 21st C technologies. We were desperate to stay in touch while knowing deep down in our zoom-fatigued bodies that we also remained deeply out of touch. Touch was dangerous. Touch was certainly no longer innocent (was it ever?)

I started (and continue) to get the sense that this work was out of touch. That all this work. Disconnected. 


Trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, rapacious human body. Pressure. Force. Stress. Strain. 


PaR - expansion. Blossoming. Products. 
Limitation. Narrow the attention. The resources. To touch the earth and our bodies on it lightly. 



> To recognize the close parallels between private property and notions of the sacred is also to recognize what is so historically odd about European social thought. Which is that – quite unlike free societies – we take this absolute, sacred quality in private property as a paradigm for all human rights and freedoms. This is what the political scientist C. B. Macpherson meant by ‘possessive individualism’. Just as every man’s home is his castle, so your right not to be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned rests on the idea that you own your own body, just as you own your chattels and possessions, and legally have the right to exclude others from your land, or house, or car, and so on.53 As we’ve seen, those who did not share this particular European conception of the sacred could indeed be killed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned – and, from Amazonia to Oceania, they often were. [@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 4, n.pag.]

- possessive individualism. Macpherson _Political Theory of Possessive Individualism_ (1962) (talks about negative rights versus positive rights, see footnote 53 in Graeber)

> ‘Societies’, wrote Mauss, ‘live by borrowing from each other, but they define themselves rather by the refusal of borrowing than by its acceptance.’14[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 5, n.pag.]
- paradox of artistic research is desire for originality/uniqueness ... to be different. To stamp one's identity on an artistic work. Define ourselves by refusal of borrowing. But how to live? Openly borrow. System of exchange. 
- perhaps schismogenesis is useful as well: "a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cumulative interaction between individuals." (from wiki)
- sonder -- useful?


> Cities are tangible things. Certain elements of their physical infrastructure – walls, roads, parks, sewers – might remain fixed for hundreds or even thousands of years; but in human terms they are never stable. People are constantly moving in and out of them, whether permanently, or seasonally for holidays and festivals, to visit relatives, trade, raid, tour around, and so on; or just in the course of their daily rounds. Yet cities have a life that transcends all this. This is not because of the permanence of stone or brick or adobe; neither is it because most people in a city actually meet one another. It is because they will often think and act as people who belong to the city – as Londoners or Muscovites or Calcuttans.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.] 
- a practice more akin to a city? It is a thing that depends on certain characteristics. Hong Kong. geography, history, architecture. 

> In other words, from the perspective of someone living in an ancient city, the city itself was not so entirely different from earlier landscapes of clans or moieties that extended across hundreds of miles. It was a structure raised primarily in the human imagination, which allowed for the possibility of amicable relations with people they had never met.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]

> The particular mix depended largely on where in the world the cities happened to be, but it’s becoming increasingly apparent that history’s first city dwellers did not always leave a harsh footprint on the environment, or on each other.[@graeber-2021-dawn Chapter 8, n.pag.]
- a practice with small footprint 
- [[Magnason - On Time and Water#The god in the steam engine]] -- about hiding fire. To create practices not built on fire (as best as possible). Not because this will make one difference to the numbers. But rather because it changes culture. 

- get stressed. becoming ghosts like bleached coral. Time of the body. How to describe an ecology of practice -- what balances and imbalances are in play? What powerful phenomena? What increased intensities? [[Magnason - On Time and Water#^9da54a]]



High fidelity. Low fidelity. Granularity. 
To go deeper into that which cannot be observed. Fall into poetry. What other languages might be useful? 
it might be I need to talk about compression -- [[lossy compression and the mythical core of culture]] -- to think through pragmatics of information?? (seems like a distraction.)

Ketamine. To render another body useless. 

Become materialists. People who care for materials. 




Videos from my newsletter -- crushed/compressed bodies. Star Wars compressor thing. 

Maps and territory - human body 

To de-instrumentalise the body. It's not a body FOR this or that thing. It is a body that is. It is a body under stress. Under pressure. It is not a body under pressure in order for something else to happen: justice, etc. professionalisation of arts through PaR creates this danger quite explicitly. It creates bodies in the service of. The body as yet another resource to be consumed. These are bodies under stress. Body as a tool - a technology - to "as a tool for assuaging my own anxiety" (4000 weeks). To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More awarded. A body radically in the present - not judged for another(future) means. 

> "Because children grow up, we think a child’s purpose is to grow up,” Herzen says. “But a child’s purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn’t disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment…Life’s bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.” -- 4000 weeks. 

The purpose of this body, under these conditions is to be this body under these conditions. These are the practices, the researches in which we resist temptation to make it a body under these conditions in order to be a body under other (instrumental) conditions. To write/understand that body as it was, this body as it is. The question then, is, what is the purpose of this body in this practice? That to understand it's purpose or purposes is to start to enter deeply the mangle of practice. That even under the worst conditions of stress, pain, and pressure, if we look to the future or futures then we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as a territory. That those futures are only maps. Useful, interesting, but partial, flawed and red herrings. The research is in the body as territory 

Finger pointing moon. 

more like a hobby --to resist the compression of time through neoliberal (eye-roll) pressure. https://seths.blog/2022/01/generative-hobbies/

Out of touch - metaphor - build into stuff on somatic practices. 
Whitman: I am large, I contain multitudes. (https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45477/song-of-myself-1892-version)

Resist with all our hearts the instrumental and future-focused way. That industrial PAR will do this. In order to do or get this I must do this. 

>  Admittedly, it’s not entirely our own fault that we approach our finite time in such a perversely instrumental and future-focused way. Powerful external pressures push us in this direction, too, because we exist inside an economic system that is instrumentalist to its core. One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit. Seeing things this way helps explain the otherwise mysterious truth that rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable. They’re very good at instrumentalizing their time, for the purpose of generating wealth for themselves; that’s the definition of being successful in a capitalist world. But in focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness. And so their days are sapped of meaning, even as their bank balances increase.(4000)

> One vivid example of how the capitalist pressure toward instrumentalizing your time saps meaning from life is the notorious case of corporate lawyers. 

That we find or be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else (including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, measured, etc). They are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies (the ultimate body to be swiped, or scrolled). These Are Radically analogue bodies in now. 

Kind of opposite to Brand's stuff in lithium. To slow down the art. To wrestle it from the culture of rapidity. 

> it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

I am proposing that we must seek methods of making that distill production from consumption; that our work is to pry apart the discombobulating effects of screendancing to be seen, and to do this in plain sight. I understand screendance to be a small enough field—and collection of practices—to interrogate and resist the logic of production predicated on consumption. We have talked about such resistance for years as a community but as dance has become more and more visible on social media, the temptation is to celebrate these days in the sun, and turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] Western culture's crash zoom to social media since around the introduction of Facebook's Like button in 2009[@alter-2017-irresistible Chapter 5 Feedback, n.pag.] has made the stakes high and ambiguous for screendance: the promise of being transmitted and seen (finally!) at the cost of extractive consumption and the "immediacy of appropriation":[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

> We need more lithium today, and merely hope to find greater reserves—or a suitable replacement—tomorrow. This revaluation has the effect of shifting the place of the natural order from something intrinsic to our practices to something extrinsic. The whole of nature becomes what economists tellingly call an _externality_.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

Not to do this in order to ... that understanding its purpose (including the possibility it has no purpose) is one's only task. When shift from that you are serving something or someone else. They feel different. I can feel the difference now. Typing while on my bed. I am quite into this. Deep in thought, in reading. I am in the process of coming to understand what to present and how. Not because of what it might bring me, but because of the ideas themselves. No utility. It is the body in the service of that creates the pressure and stress. 

They re practices that are incompleteable. They stretch into time the way those we love and who love us:

> Taking a walk in the countryside, like listening to a favorite song or meeting friends for an evening of conversation, is thus a good example of what the philosopher Kieran Setiya calls an “atelic activity,” meaning that its value isn’t derived from its telos, or ultimate aim. You shouldn’t be aiming to get a walk “done”; nor are you likely to reach a point in life when you’ve accomplished all the walking you were aiming to do. “You can stop doing these things, and you eventually will, but you cannot complete them,” Setiya explains. They have “no outcome whose achievement exhausts them and therefore brings them to an end.” And so the only reason to do them is for themselves alone: “There is no more to going for a walk than what you are doing right now.”

Atelic. (Is a hobby!) But there's a lie here isn't there? But in recognising the difference we are changed. Our bodies are changed. The pressures are changed. 

This is the body that takes the time it needs to take. I think this is body based PaR. A body under consideration that takes the time it needs to take. 

Q (for meditation?): what is the role of "control" and "force" in such a body?

Meditations. A way to knowledge that the time in this space, online, is a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances, limits. That in this time, there is time for you to reflect, note, imagine, drift. 

Acknowledge three books (which are not at all academic): 4000, dawn of everything, on time and water

Meditation: what is the role of patience in your research? What (if anything) does it have to do with originality? 

Meditation: when to admit to not-knowing? That the territory is unattainable. That paradox lies at the heart of research. 

Work that goes on. That is followed. 

Always use plural bodies. Sense of collective non-atomic bodies.??

Mum: I can't believe it happened so quickly. It took precisely as long as it needed. But ...

See Heidegger in 4000 - we are time. 

"Entering space and time completely" - von Franz in 4000

What is my warrant in making these claims? What right do I have to suggest such things. I will let you decide depending on their value to you. 

Brown Atlas: see intro on maps and layers. To orient. 

Quality of the questioning. The questions lack precision. They are more like drag nets. Capturing all. What is the risk in the precision? To narrow attention. I don't have evidence of this. It's a feeling. Perhaps a proposition. 

Haiku by Issa:

In this world we walk on the roof of hell gathering blossoms.

Source: https://onbeing.org/programs/jane-hirshfield-the-fullness-of-things/#

Hirshfield:
“Shared fate” is a very important phrase for me. I’ve been thinking about it since I was 17.

Tippett:
What was it when you were 17 that made you start thinking about that?

Hirshfield:
You know, I only remember one line of a poem I wrote then, but the line was, “To define the meaning of we is to find a life of a kind, but who is to say?”

You know, that to me has always — who do we think of, when we use the pronoun “we”? And I want my “we” to be absolutely continuous amongst my fellow humans, amongst living beings, amongst the largeness of the expanding universe, down to the tiniest physics and particle.

See my note from ch 8 of Dawn re practice as a city. Belonging. Shifting. Permanent. Temporary. 

- domestication -- requires human intervention (else it dies). opposite of this for PaR and the body. The danger of domestication. Keeping it wild. The lightest of touches. But also narrowing and being specific. (re questions).

> By understanding as a full-body phenomenon the consciousness that lenses our view of reality and shapes our life-experience, we can not only become better stewards of our own bodies and of the planet we share with other bodies, human and nonhuman, but we can begin to dismantle the artificial hierarchies and categories by which we have long bolstered our creaturely centrality across the various scales and spectra of existence, from Ptolemism to anthropocentrism to racism, choosing instead to be both humbled and hallowed by the evolutionary wonder of consciousness.

### This body

Recently, whenever I meet or see someone, I've been asking them a simple question. What is your body to you? I then ask them to respond by starting with the words "This body" (or however that may be translated into their mother language). For instance, in italian, it would be "Questo corpo".

Meditation.

I would love for you to email yours to me -- in whichever language you choose. Or even just put them in the chat. This would be a beautiful gift.

I like to imagine having a physical location to collect all these instances of _this body_, perhaps like Nichlas Luhrman's zettelkasten or slipboxes (image). Like the analogue library catalogues I remember from my youth. Each instance a removable card: something to be held, to be touched, reflected on. Something that long after my great-niece Zoe Ellis-Craig is dead, some time after 2106, would not require any hidden fires to sustain it, but just a little bit of space in someone's home. People could visit it, photograph it, steal from it, add to it. Perhaps such a simple thing might be a way to become a good ancestor while paying attention to the smallness of the human body.  

Here is a sample of what I have collected so far.  

This body is aging
This body makes things possible 
This body is constantly reinventing itself 
This body is beautifully asymmetrical just like all the other bodies 
This body knows how to walk, run and dance
This body is not like the others
This body feels
This body is wounded 
This body sees and is seen
This body has buried the bodies of others 
This body adapts
This body has been exploited 
This body cannot be known
This body is "the supreme instrument of sanity and self-regard" 
This body is at a loss
This body houses these feelings 
This body is consciousness and self-knowing 
This body cannot escape technology
This body is unknown and cannot be known
This body is bleeding
This body is broken
This body is a time-traveler
This body is overwhelmed in detail 
This body is the place through which experiences flood 
This body is where I need to go
This body belongs to this mind
This body trusts you
This body has a 4 billion year old memory 
This body is in pain
This body has no boundary
This body is not far from death and I am not afraid
This body will die
This body humbles me over and over again

Thank you. And thank you once again for being given this tremendous honour to to present these ideas to you this morning. It has been a pleasure and this body is most certainly humbled.
