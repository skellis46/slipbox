## conference details
Conference Title: Harnessing a 21st Century Approach to Performing Arts: Technology Practice, Education & Research.

### Title

Pressure, stress and strain: the body in time in practice-as-research

### Abstract

This is a shared screen desktop performance that explores the body under stress, and the role that artistic research practices might play in helping us understand the temporal scale of our fleeting, fragile and rapacious human bodies. Where so many body-based practices are predicated on nuanced and refined encounters with presence or awareness, what might the purpose of the body be in artistic research practices that extend through time? My grandmother, the artist Gladys Eastwood (1913-2005), used to joke that, "If you are going to have delusions, you may as well have delusions of grandeur." Indeed, it is easy to measure, admire or fetishise the grandeur of the human body's possibilities. But what if the body experienced and imagined through and in time affords us the humility to pay attention to what geologists call _deep time_? What then for how we steward the body in motion and the body under duress?

### Biography
Simon Ellis is an artist working with research practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa/New Zealand, but now lives in London. He grew up in a politicised family environment where they often talked about things like human dignity, consumerism and even technology. These, in turn, have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. Simon also thinks a lot about the ways humans might value things that are not easily commodified, and likes to imagine a world filled with people who are sensitive to their own bodies, and the bodies of others.

# pressure, stress and strain: the body in time

Trying to make sense of the scale of this fleeting, fragile, rapacious human body. Pressure. Force. Stress. Strain. 

make sure go through [[Graeber and Wengrow - The Dawn of Everything]] for marginal notes that might apply here.

In this shared screen performance. 

The game of people we loved and were loved by. Gladys. Zoe. Delusions of grandeur. 

Recording of her singing? 

250 years. This body extended through time. It's traumas, hopes, dreams, desires, limitations, number of bones, number of muscles. 

Out of touch - metaphor
Whitman: I am large, I contain multitudes. 

PaR - expansion. Blossoming. Products. 
Limitation. Narrow the attention. The resources. To touch the earth and our bodies on it lightly. 

This body. Collecting. 

This body is not far from death and I am not afraid. 
This body can't escape technology. 
This body is unknown. 
This body can't be know. 

High fidelity. Low fidelity. Granularity. 
To go deeper into that which cannot be observed. Fall into poetry. What other languages might be useful? 

Ketamine. To render another body useless. 

Become materialists. People who care for materials. 

Ask them what their body is to them. Give a minute. 


Videos from my newsletter -- crushed/compressed bodies. Star Wars compressor thing. 

Maps and territory - human body 

To de-instrumentalise the body. It's not a body FOR this or that thing. It is a body that is. It is a body under stress. Under pressure. It is not a body under pressure in order for something else to happen: justice, etc. professionalisation of arts through PaR creates this danger quite explicitly. It creates bodies in the service of. The body as yet another resource to be consumed. These are bodies under stress. Body as a tool - a technology - to "as a tool for assuaging my own anxiety" (4000 weeks). To be this. To be that. To be more of this. Less of that. More awarded. A body radically in the present - not judged for another(future) means. 

> "Because children grow up, we think a child’s purpose is to grow up,” Herzen says. “But a child’s purpose is to be a child. Nature doesn’t disdain what only lives for a day. It pours the whole of itself into each moment…Life’s bounty is in its flow. Later is too late.” -- 4000 weeks. 

The purpose of this body, under these conditions is to be this body under these conditions. These are the practices, the researches in which we resist temptation to make it a body under these conditions in order to be a body under other (instrumental) conditions. To write/understand that body as it was, this body as it is. The question then, is, what is the purpose of this body in this practice? That to understand it's purpose or purposes is to start to enter deeply the mangle of practice. That even under the worst conditions of stress, pain, and pressure, if we look to the future or futures then we fail to understand and indeed experience the body as a territory. That those futures are only maps. Useful, interesting, but partial, flawed and red herrings. The research is in the body as territory 

Finger pointing moon. 

more like a hobby --to resist the compression of time through neoliberal (eye-roll) pressure. https://seths.blog/2022/01/generative-hobbies/

Out of touch - metaphor - build into stuff on somatic practices. 
Whitman: I am large, I contain multitudes. (https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45477/song-of-myself-1892-version)

Resist with all our hearts the instrumental and future-focused way. That industrial PAR will do this. In order to do or get this I must do this. 

>  Admittedly, it’s not entirely our own fault that we approach our finite time in such a perversely instrumental and future-focused way. Powerful external pressures push us in this direction, too, because we exist inside an economic system that is instrumentalist to its core. One way of understanding capitalism, in fact, is as a giant machine for instrumentalizing everything it encounters—the earth’s resources, your time and abilities (or “human resources”)—in the service of future profit. Seeing things this way helps explain the otherwise mysterious truth that rich people in capitalist economies are often surprisingly miserable. They’re very good at instrumentalizing their time, for the purpose of generating wealth for themselves; that’s the definition of being successful in a capitalist world. But in focusing so hard on instrumentalizing their time, they end up treating their lives in the present moment as nothing but a vehicle in which to travel toward a future state of happiness. And so their days are sapped of meaning, even as their bank balances increase.(4000)

> One vivid example of how the capitalist pressure toward instrumentalizing your time saps meaning from life is the notorious case of corporate lawyers. 

That we find or be in bodies that are less pointed at. That are not abstractions or tools for something else (including bodies to be admired, fetishised, mocked, measured, etc). They are not bodies as tourist destinations or instagrammable bodies (the ultimate body to be swiped, or scrolled). These Are Radically analogue bodies in now. 

Kind of opposite to Brand's stuff in lithium. To slow down the art. To wrestle it from the culture of rapidity. 

> it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

I am proposing that we must seek methods of making that distill production from consumption; that our work is to pry apart the discombobulating effects of screendancing to be seen, and to do this in plain sight. I understand screendance to be a small enough field—and collection of practices—to interrogate and resist the logic of production predicated on consumption. We have talked about such resistance for years as a community but as dance has become more and more visible on social media, the temptation is to celebrate these days in the sun, and turn our backs on promises to the future in which we "expand our understanding of responsibility to include how our actions effect people we will never meet".[@jacobs-2018-tending n.p.] Western culture's crash zoom to social media since around the introduction of Facebook's Like button in 2009[@alter-2017-irresistible Chapter 5 Feedback, n.pag.] has made the stakes high and ambiguous for screendance: the promise of being transmitted and seen (finally!) at the cost of extractive consumption and the "immediacy of appropriation":[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

> We need more lithium today, and merely hope to find greater reserves—or a suitable replacement—tomorrow. This revaluation has the effect of shifting the place of the natural order from something intrinsic to our practices to something extrinsic. The whole of nature becomes what economists tellingly call an _externality_.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.30]

Not to do this in order to ... that understanding its purpose (including the possibility it has no purpose) is one's only task. When shift from that you are serving something or someone else. They feel different. I can feel the difference now. Typing while on my bed. I am quite into this. Deep in thought, in reading. I am in the process of coming to understand what to present and how. Not because of what it might bring me, but because of the ideas themselves. No utility. It is the body in the service of that creates the pressure and stress. 

They re practices that are incompleteable. They stretch into time the way those we love and who love us:

> Taking a walk in the countryside, like listening to a favorite song or meeting friends for an evening of conversation, is thus a good example of what the philosopher Kieran Setiya calls an “atelic activity,” meaning that its value isn’t derived from its telos, or ultimate aim. You shouldn’t be aiming to get a walk “done”; nor are you likely to reach a point in life when you’ve accomplished all the walking you were aiming to do. “You can stop doing these things, and you eventually will, but you cannot complete them,” Setiya explains. They have “no outcome whose achievement exhausts them and therefore brings them to an end.” And so the only reason to do them is for themselves alone: “There is no more to going for a walk than what you are doing right now.”

Atelic. (Is a hobby!) But there's a lie here isn't there? But in recognising the difference we are changed. Our bodies are changed. The pressures are changed. 

This is the body that takes the time it needs to take. I think this is body based PaR. A body under consideration that takes the time it needs to take. 

Q (for meditation?): what is the role of "control" and "force" in such a body?

Meditations. A way to knowledge that the time in this space, online, is a different kind of time with different kinds of pressures, affordances, limits. That in this time, there is time for you to reflect, note, imagine, drift. 

Acknowledge three books (which are not at all academic): 4000, dawn of everything, on time and water

Meditation: what is the role of patience in your research? What (if anything) does it have to do with originality? 

Meditation: when to admit to not-knowing? That the territory is unattainable. That paradox lies at the heart of research. 

Work that goes on. That is followed. 

Always use plural bodies. Sense of collective non-atomic bodies.??

Mum: I can't believe it happened so quickly. It took precisely as long as it needed. But ...

See Heidegger in 4000 - we are time. 

"Entering space and time completely" - von Franz in 4000

 What is my warrant in making these claims? What right do I have to suggest such things. I will let you decide depending on their value to you. 

Brown Atlas: see intro on maps and layers. To orient. 

Quality of the questioning. The questions lack precision. They are more like drag nets. Capturing all. What is the risk in the precision? To narrow attention. I don't have evidence of this. It's a feeling. Perhaps a proposition.

Hirshfield:
“Shared fate” is a very important phrase for me. I’ve been thinking about it since I was 17.

Tippett:
What was it when you were 17 that made you start thinking about that?

Hirshfield:
You know, I only remember one line of a poem I wrote then, but the line was, “To define the meaning of we is to find a life of a kind, but who is to say?”

You know, that to me has always — who do we think of, when we use the pronoun “we”? And I want my “we” to be absolutely continuous amongst my fellow humans, amongst living beings, amongst the largeness of the expanding universe, down to the tiniest physics and particle.

See my note from ch 8 of Dawn re practice as a city. Belonging. Shifting. Permanent. Temporary. 

- domestication -- requires human intervention (else it dies). opposite of this for PaR and the body. The danger of domestication. Keeping it wild. The lightest of touches. But also narrowing and being specific. (re questions).

> By understanding as a full-body phenomenon the consciousness that lenses our view of reality and shapes our life-experience, we can not only become better stewards of our own bodies and of the planet we share with other bodies, human and nonhuman, but we can begin to dismantle the artificial hierarchies and categories by which we have long bolstered our creaturely centrality across the various scales and spectra of existence, from Ptolemism to anthropocentrism to racism, choosing instead to be both humbled and hallowed by the evolutionary wonder of consciousness.
