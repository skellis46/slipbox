# noë - strange tools

_previous note:_ 

---

_Strange Tools_ is a book by the philosopher Alva Noë about the importance of art in our lives. Noë writes that the basic argument of the book is as follows:

>Our lives are structured by organization. Art is a practice for bringing our organization into view; in doing this, art reorganizes us.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 4. Art Loops and the Garden of Eden, n.p.]
