# the unphotographable

_previous note:_ [[photography freed the hand]]

> I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see — who and what we are — to what can be photographed. I think of [Susan Sontag](https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/09/16/susan-sontag-on-photography-social-media/), who called it “aesthetic consumerism” half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The Unphotographable — Saturdays, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.
