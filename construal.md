# construal

_previous note:_ [[apophenia and seeking patterns]]

> In social psychology, a construal is a way that people perceive, comprehend, and interpret their world, particularly the acts of others toward them.[^wiki]

[^wiki]: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal)

Important in cognitive psychology because of human need to create schemas to fill in gaps or make sense of complex situations. Context is critical.

Three sources of construal in humans: "the need to feel good about ourselves, the need to be accurate, and the need to belong" (wiki).
