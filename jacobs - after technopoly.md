# jacobs - after technopoly

_previous note:_ 

---

Alan Jacobs is a humanities scholar and in this article -- After Technopoly -- he calls on the work of English political philosopher Michael Oakeshott and Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski to describe the _technopoly_:

>Technopoly is a system that arises within a society that views moral life as an application of rules but that produces people who practice moral life by habits of affection, not by rules. (Think of Silicon Valley social engineers who have created and capitalized upon Twitter outrage mobs.) Put another way, technopoly arises from the tech- nological core of society but produces people who are driven and formed by the mythical core.[@jacobs_after_2019 p.4]

This interplay -- between rationalism ("The apparent captain of technopoly is what Oakeshott calls a 'rationalist'"[p.7]) and myth -- is a key aspect of Jacobs' thinking. He suggests "the possibility that technocratic rationalism can be not averted but transcended—that there is something better, not in opposition to it, but on the other side of it. Something that will in time emerge."[p.13]

The writing is -- like much of Jacobs' thinking -- a celebration of the beauty, power and value of myth making.

_questions & thoughts:_

- there's a link with the concept of direct experience, or experiences that are beyond (or before) words [[finger pointing at the moon]]

--- 

_consider:_

- [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
- contrast with Noë's understanding of rationality: [[rationality and what is likely]]
- and further contract with empiricism [[rationalism vs empiricism]]
