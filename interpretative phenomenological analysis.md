# interpretative phenomenological analysis

_previous note:_ [[Hefferon and Ollis - Just clicks]]

Happened across this research method in above paper. Here's a chatGPT summary:

> Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) is a qualitative research approach used to explore how individuals make sense of their personal and social experiences. It focuses on the subjective perceptions and meanings people ascribe to their experiences. IPA is particularly concerned with understanding the lived experience from the perspective of the participant, aiming to capture how individuals perceive and interpret their world. The method involves detailed, reflective analysis of participants' accounts, often through in-depth interviews. It is interpretive, as researchers seek to understand and interpret the meanings that participants assign to their experiences. IPA is commonly used in psychology and social sciences to explore complex, emotional, or significant life experiences.

I actually think the notes on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretative_phenomenological_analysis) are more than useful:

- idiographic focus ("which means that instead of producing [generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomothetic "Nomothetic") findings, it aims to offer insights into how a given person, in a given context, [makes sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning-making "Meaning-making") of a given [situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon_(philosophy)))"
- low participant numbers: normally 3-6 but just 1 is possible
- purposive sampling (not randomised) / also homogenuous sampling
- collection via interviews, diairies, focus groups
- does not set out to test hypotheses
- double hermeneutic: "the analyst attempts to make sense of the participant's attempts to make sense of their own experiences"
- bottom-up -- generating codes from the data (from data analysis)

- very useful collection of possibilities for [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project]]
