# artistic artefacts encode relationships

_previous note:_ [[trading zones for experiments and knowledge]]

---

Stunning analogy of intertwined threads and a rough brick wall in relation to how artworks are composed:

>It is by this intercalation of different patterns of instrument, theory, and practice embodied in the traits of objects and events that art is given its sense of continuity as a whole.[@garbolino_what_2013 p.84]

This intercalation is like a rough brick wall that is kept strong by the components of theory, experiments and instruments. Across these three components we weave a progression of understanding and practice through time. What Garbolino calls "continuity" in the quote above. 

Garbolino cites Kubler who writes that every work of art is:

>A complex having not only traits, each with a different systematic age, but having also clusters of traits, or aspects, each with its own age, like any other organization of matter, such as a mammal, of which the blood and the nerves are of different biological antiquity, and the eye and the skin are of different systematic age.[Kubler, in @garbolino_what_2013 p.83]

>Artistic artefacts encode relationships among physical objects, people, and particular settings. These relational properties as well as physical objects are things of the world, and they contribute to shaping the forms in the sequences of artistic phenomena.[@garbolino_what_2013 p.84]

_thoughts & links:_

- Garbolino's idea of how artistic artefacts are part of something bigger than themselves is critical to understanding the limits and possibilities of [[dissemination, accumulation and originality]]
- completely love this sense of time in Kubler's thinking about a work of art, and I would suggest the importance of acknowledging (or perhaps releasing?) that sense of time in an art work. And that this time belongs to others as well, and can never be owned by one person's history. This reminds me of how I've described the choreographer as steward (see [ellis-2015-jealousy.pdf]([ellis-2015-jealousy.pdf](hook://file/uT1LUEAJt?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=ellis-2015-jealousy.pdf)) and [ellis-2019-pause.pdf]([ellis-2019-pause.pdf](hook://file/uT1QQvcSq?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=ellis-2019-pause.pdf)))
-  I wrote a blog post about this note at [practiceasresearchblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/03/the-different-ages-of-an-artwork/](https://practiceasresearchblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/03/the-different-ages-of-an-artwork/)
-  at a stretch I could relate to Ingold's [[fields of practice]] and the sense of the things that are beyond or outside of ourselves

- [ ] look at Kubler's book to decide to read in depth: [kubler-1962-shape.pdf](hook://file/y8OERC3VT?p=MjAyMDA3MTQgLSBkb2NzIHRvIHByb2Nlc3MvcGFyIGFuZF9vciBrbm93bGVkZ2U=&n=kubler-1962-shape.pdf)
