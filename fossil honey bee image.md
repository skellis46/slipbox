# fossil honey bee image

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]


![[honey-bee-fossil.jpg]]

Image from _The Life of Bees_ by Seeley. Got me thinking about old old memories. Of this one little bee through time. An accumulation. Fossils are implausibly beautiful and feel like the opposite of [[people are made of stories]] or how [[people are nothing before their machines]]
As if the room ([[child-sized chairs and a video camera]]) might be covered in images of fossils. More akin to the [[accumulation of local soil and local culture]] -- but extended through time.
