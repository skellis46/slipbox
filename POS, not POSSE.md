# POS, not POSSE

_previous note:_ 

> I guess, when I was still promoting my published writings, I remember often — quite often — getting replies or quote-tweets from people who _had no idea what I was saying_ but wanted to comment on it in a way that corroborated or reinforced their sense of themselves, their social self-presentation, a social self-presentation that typically took the form of performative partisan self-righteousness.

> Well, sort of. I don’t think of _all_ my online readers as malicious invasive predators. But there are a _lot_ of people out there in social-media world who hear everything but see and understand nothing. I’ll just tip-toe out of their range, thank you very much.
