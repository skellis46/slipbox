# Philip - So You Want to Build a Wood-Fired Oven? Start Here. by King Arthur Baking

Built-in-place ovens require detailed planning (property line and structural setbacks, cement foundations in colder climates, and occasionally, building permits — check with your local town regulations), but they tend to be the best, most long-lasting tools for baking. They generally have significant thermal mass and insulation, which promote a more even bake, and they offer a larger baking chamber, which is ideal for a cottage business should your hobby become something more serious. The size will vary, but even a basic oven may easily run a footprint of 5’ by 5’ by 7’ high.


I asked Melina what she tells people who are enthralled with her oven and want their own. She advises them that the “mud oven is the fastest way to know if it’s something that you want to engage with.” You can literally build one in a day and use it soon after it cures with materials you might have right under your feet (clay, sand, straw, and rocks).
