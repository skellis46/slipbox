# finger pointing at the moon

_previous note:_  [[human experience and language]]

---

>they see that language is only a finger pointing at the moon and not the moon itself.[@johnston_cloud_2012 p.2]

_questions & thoughts:_

- I understand this phrase to encapsulate the power, limitations and beauty of artistic thinking and practice in the academy
- Johnston's text (or the original unknown text)
- see [[to experience reality]] for how it was the Buddha who was thought to have said this (quote from Thich Nhat Hanh in George Mumford)

--- 

_consider:_ 

- [[art practice and artistic research]]
- [[search for truth]]
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
