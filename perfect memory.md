# perfect memory

_previous note:_ [[Ted Chiang - Chiang-2019-Exhalation]]

The early development of an artistic-project.  Original inspiration from Ted Chiang's _The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling_. See [[what might it be like to have a perfect memory?]]

- [[index -- artistic practice]]

## early ideas (from 9 August 2023)

I have a perfect memory (from reading Chiang) -- [[people are made of stories]]
I remember being born (film from Adrienne)
I remember dancing. Or "remembering dancing. Remembering being born." (without subject). Inspired by [[Annie-B Parson - The Choreography of Everyday Life]] - and her list of tears
Falling in love. 
Start as video essay and dissolve into film about losing everything????
Relate to sense of self? Of no self? [[losing one's self]]


The video essay could start by covering popular culture: Total Recall, Eternal Sunshine, Momento, that other film about drug use (!!), etc. Better that it start directly in the narrative. And diverge out into 'video essay'. 

"I remember seeing a film called Momento"

- role of the memory in the future [[memory and the future]] -- "to simulate the future"
- relationship to mindfulness and how Sati means to remember [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]
- David [[Whyte - The Three Marriages]] -- and how attraction becomes abstract and is "built on the momentum of memory". What if one had a perfect memory in a relationship? (Chiang goes into this really)
- upgrading our memory in [[stone age mind in a space age world]]
- and what role does imagination have in a person with perfect memory? That it is gone? See [[dedication to the process]] and the accidental dance between collected memory and influence
- memory as a process of exteriorisation (and technologies of information) -- relates to [[tools for remembering]] -- in [[technics as a process of exteriorization]] and in [[technics, techne, and technology]]. See also [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]] and his thesis re memory and liberation of organs. And how writing externalised memory in [[L. M. Sacasas - The Analog City and the Digital City]]
- how arts and culture (particularly through memory) endow dignity and honor to public life (Arendt) - in [[art and culture glue human relations]]
- "This body has a 4.5 billion year old memory." - in [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]] and [[this body]]
- [[saeculum]] -- just perfect. The death of a human with a perfect memory
- contrast with [[Gabrielle Zevin - Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow]] and the diminished version of AI after a person's death
- how memory makes individual notes a song: [[Claudia Hammond - Time Warped]]
- distinction between memory and consciousness in [[Annaka Harris - Harris-2019-Conscious]]
- memory as pattern re-creation (as opposed to retrieval) in [[Andy Clark - Being There Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again]]
- memory as part of how selves are constructed in [[Jay L. Garfield - Losing Ourselves]]
- we will be remembered nowhere in the future -- distinction from one's own memory to the cultural memory of that person. He'll be just as gone as anyone else. See [[Dzieza - Inside the AI Factory - the humans that make tech seem human]] -- the context there is commerical content moderation (!)
