# the moving talking dead are everywhere

_previous note:_ [[search and the detachment of text from the book]]

> I have less than fifteen minutes of video of my own mother. Now the moving, talking dead are everywhere, available anytime, from any pocket. It's a rare week when we dead-to-be don't surrender a few more minutes of [p.54] our souls to the overflowing archives. Not even the craziest SF story from my youth predicted it. Imagine a planet where the past never went away but kept happening again and again, forever.[@powers-2021-bewilderment pp.53-54]
