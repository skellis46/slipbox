# sitting on the ground

> Further, like other creatures, humans until recently sat without chairs. Hunter-gatherers rarely make furniture, and in many parts of the non-Western world people still sit often on the ground. In a delightfully comprehensive study, the anthropologist Gordon Hewes documented more than a hundred postures that humans from 480 different cultures adopt when they sit without a chair. Chairless humans often sit on the ground with their legs stretched out, cross-legged, or to the side; sometimes they kneel on one or two legs; and frequently they squat with their knees so bent that their heels either touch or come close to the backs of their thighs.[@lieberman-2020-exercised Chapter 3: Sitting: Is it the new smoking? n.pag.]
