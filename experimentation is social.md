# experimentation is social

_previous note:_ [[schwab - experiment]]

---

>Only the combination of matter and discourse gives experimentation its own distinct identity in the field of knowledge. This makes experimentation not only an epistemic project but also, as Shapin argues, deeply social.[pp.121-122] 
>Hans-Jörg Rheinberger (1997) calls such a combination of matter and discourse  ‘experimental system’. Experimental systems are complex apparatuses for the production of knowledge.[p.122]

>The social dimension of experimentation stems from the agreement that has to be reached whereby a particular something resulting from the experimental system is, in fact, matter-of-fact. This something as matter-of-fact does not strictly speaking exist before such (public) negotiation, making an epistemic thing not only a piece of knowledge but also an ‘artefact of communication’ (Shapin 1984, 484).[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123] ^da953d

>Both the communicative and the material role of replication allow for a slippage from concrete experiment to universal theory: if a large and diverse group of people believes something to be a matter of fact in a number of different experiments, can we not assume it to be a matter of fact in all possible cases and for all possible witnesses?[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.123]

- no you cannot assume this. Should be seeking cases where it is not believed (dealing here with falsifiability)

>Through experimental systems, we have the ability to create matters of fact, which we paradoxically believe have been there all along. In other words, it appears as if my knowledge of the world is a reflection of the world as it is and not an elaborate coproduction. Suggesting this kind of agency, however, does not mean that the knowledge we end up with is a cultural construct; it only means that epistemic things lacking identity are strange natural/cultural ‘hybrids’ (Latour 1993) or ‘proto-objects’ (Schwab 2012), which, once they ‘decay’ into knowledge, become associated with either nature or culture as something ‘found’ or ‘made’.[@schwab_experiment_2015 p.122]

- what of the senses? what might actually be there? How to untangle this construction?
