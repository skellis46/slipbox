# the act of perceiving itself coming to awareness

_previous note:_ [[embodiment and illusion of self]]

> With growing alienation, even the act of perceiving itself may come to awareness. Then, the patients are like the spectators of their own perceptive processes: ‘I saw everything I did like a ﬁlm-camera’ [38] (p.132). This alienation of perception turns the objects into mere appearances or phantoms, hence the artiﬁcial, enigmatic alteration of the environment experienced in predelusional perplexity [39,40]. [@fuchs-2009-embodiment p.572]

- from [[Fuchs and Schlimme - Embodiment and psychopathology a phenomenological perspective]]

My note on kindle under the above quotation: 

I'm reminded of how in [[authentic movement]] there's a sense of the self as being observed with love from the outside. As if welcoming the disembodiment. But the paradox is that it's a strong feeling of deep embodiment. As if the alienation (as Fuchs calls it) is a feature and not a bug in AM?

But I'm not so sure about this feeling of deep embodiment. Perhaps the feeling is far more fluid or plastic than we want or care to believe. Reminded here of the rubber-hand illusion (which Seth describes as a "cornerstone of research on embodiment") and the body swapping technology as described in Anil Seth's _Being You_:

> These higher reaches of selfhood are fully dissociable from the embodied self. Many non-human animals, as well as human infants, may experience embodied selfhood without having – or missing – any accompanying sense of personal identity. [@seth-2021-being Location 2639]

Note above the way in which we tend to conflate embodiment with selfhood. This is what happens for me (I think) in [[authentic movement]]: the heightened attention to the body from the inside ([[interoception]]) makes it possible to loosen the sense of embodied selfhood -- that these physical actions and movements (as well as imaginings and memories) are observable as objects in the way that I might observe an apple on a desk. They are happening beyond or outside of the self. They are not _me_. The higher reaches of selfhood are things like autobiographical memory. Seth suggests that we are only partially 'fooled' by body swapping tech and RHI -- it's more like a sensation or feeling. This is distinct from visual illusions in which we are fully surprised:

> As I mentioned earlier, the typical experience in the rubber hand illusion is of somehow feeling the fake hand to be part of one’s body, while clearly knowing that it isn’t. [@seth-2021-being Location 2609] 



- [[perfect memory]]: thinking here about autobiographical memory and certainty, contrasted with the plasticity of embodiment. 
- [[mirror with phone]]: some replication of rubber hand illusion (involves mirrors). Who am I in this? 
- [[losing oneself]]: Seth gets right into this regarding the body; see for instance [[out of body experiences]]
