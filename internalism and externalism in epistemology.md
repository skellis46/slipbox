# internalism and externalism in epistemology

_previous note:_ [[epistemology starts with fallibility]]

This essay for Aeon by writer, teacher and philosopher [Nate Sheff](http://natesheff.com) focuses on the internalism versus externalism debate in epistemology. 

All forms of internalism state that justification for our beliefs comes from the inside, and must be "accessible from your perspective"[@sheff-2021-how n.pag.] This is akin to giving an account, or as Sheff says, showing your work (and he uses examples of Socrates asking others to do this). 

> In theory, your account should be the certificate of authenticity that can justify a belief, and this should satisfy internalists, since you’ve produced your account from your thoughts ‘from the inside’.[@sheff-2021-how n.pag.] 

Sheff writes the _looking within_ "places a huge burden on the shoulders of reflection."[@sheff-2021-how n.pag.
]
Externalists stats that it's possible to have a justified belief "even if I can't check whatever makes it credible."[@sheff-2021-how n.pag.] The perspective grew through reliabilism "which holds that beliefs are justified when produced by a reliable process".[@sheff-2021-how n.pag.]

> For reliabilism, justification flows from the reliability of the process, not its accessibility to consciousness. Hence, reliabilism is an externalist theory, not internalist.[@sheff-2021-how n.pag.]

> In the same way, the internalism/externalism debate might mask deeper issues and promising alternatives. It’s not that ‘Is justification internal?’ is a wrongheaded or malformed question. Rather, it limits our options at a point where the logical space of possibilities should be wide open. After all, what is a knower, according to both internalists and externalists? Knowers are believers – they react to a prepackaged world by forming sentence-sized opinions. But this claim is not a given, no more than is the idea that the mind is a substance.

> Let’s retrace our steps. We’ve learned something from asking about justification and whether it’s internal. We’ve seen how different conceptions of justification can embody different theories of what knowers are. We have an opportunity to take the path we noted at the beginning, to explore a more basic question. Reflecting on our track records, our successes and failures, we can ask: ‘What is enquiry? What are we doing when we try to know?’
