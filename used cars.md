# used cars

In late March of 2022 a colleague and I were talking about the demands of working across and beyond one's own discipline or community of practice. My colleague suggested that we need to get a feel for what is enough to understand or know about that discipline before engaging with the experts of those communities. But what is enough? 

In 2001, Site Magazine printed an interview by Power Ekroth and Swen-Olov Wallenstein with Jens Hoffman called _Interdisciplinary Laboratory_.[1]  In it, Wallenstein describes a phenomenon called _used-car syndrome_ that he thinks was coined by the art critic [Hal Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Foster_(art_critic)). It goes like this:

 > . . .  people from different fields will always get attracted to the most conservative ideas from the other fields. This way you end up with the following equation: ‘you buy my used car, I buy your used car, and then we end up with two really shitty cars’.

At that time I was deeply engaged with working with artists from other disciplines and I remember reading of Foster's used-car syndrome as a kind of warning.
