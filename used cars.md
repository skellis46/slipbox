# used cars

In late March of 2022 a colleague and I were talking about the demands of working across and with other disciplines. My colleague suggested that we need to get a feel for what is enough to understand or know about that discipline before engaging with the experts of those communities. But what is enough? 

In 2001, Site Magazine printed an interview by Power Ekroth and Swen-Olov Wallenstein with Jens Hoffman called _Interdisciplinary Laboratory_.[1]  In it, Wallenstein describes a phenomenon called _used-car syndrome_ that he thinks was coined by the art critic [Hal Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Foster_(art_critic)). It goes like this:

 > ... people from different fields will always get attracted to the most conservative ideas from the other fields. This way you end up with the following equation: ‘you buy my used car, I buy your used car, and then we end up with two really shitty cars’.

At the time I was deeply engaged with working with artists from other disciplines and I remember reading of Foster's used-car syndrome as a warning: do not end up with a shitty old car. Now I see such a car so differently. It has dents, rust, wonky parts, and dated colours and materials that lie at the heart of creative constraints and possibilities. The car generates a question with an ecological feel: what has been made in the past that we might re-use together to help human beings see our present differently? 

The other thing that is strange, looking back, is that I failed to ask three questions of this _used-car syndrome_: 1) Is the statement true? 2) How do I know this? 3) If it is true then _why_ are people from different fields attracted to the most conservative ideas from other fields? At the very least, I wanted the used-car syndrome to be true because it propped up my ambitions to create _newness_ – something I remember [Nancy Stark-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Stark_Smith) describing as a cult.

Nevertheless, working with or across other disciplines is hard. In their introduction to _Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet_ the editors Tsing, Swanson, Gan and Bubandt describe the "disciplinary prejudices into which each scholar is trained"[2] and of the need to be generous in how we might view the work, practices and understandings of other disciplines. Such generosity is, I suspect, quite rare and it reminded me of Wendell Berry's[3] 2002 essay _Two Minds_ in which he proposes that there are two human minds: the Rational Mind and the Sympathetic Mind:

> The Rational Mind is motivated by the fear of being misled, of being wrong. Its purpose is to exclude everything that cannot empirically or experimentally be proven to be a fact.

> The Sympathetic Mind is motivated by fear of error of a very different kind: the error of carelessness, of being unloving. Its purpose is to be considerate of whatever is present, to leave nothing out.[4]

Berry's key objection is not the nature of these two minds as if one were 'bad' and the other 'good', but rather the cultural exclusiveness of the Rational Mind. If we only see the world through one set of (powerful) eyes, then how is working with generosity outside of our training or prejudices even possible?  

I'll finish with some reminders and a bit of housekeeping:

- these brief essays are only for subscribers and are not available anywhere else online. Actually, this is not entirely true. In the spirit of working as transparently as possible, all the writing I do – including every edit – is maintained on a rather nerdy version control system called Github. You can see what is called the _blame file_ for this essay at [https://github.com/skellis46/slipbox/blame/master/used%20cars.md](https://github.com/skellis46/slipbox/blame/master/used%20cars.md) A blame file is normally used to find out who wrote particular pieces of code in software development, but in this case it enables you to track back through the different versions of this essay as I was writing it.
- although I use Mailchimp to maintain and send these essays I have turned off all their tracking technologies. I have no idea if you are reading this or even opening the email (but I hope you are).
- if you think of someone who might like the ideas in this writing, please share it with them.
- I've decided not to include links to previous newsletters below but if you'd like to catch up on them just drop me a line and I can send the links.

Thanks, and sending warm wishes from autumn in the north.
