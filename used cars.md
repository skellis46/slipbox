# used cars

In late March of 2022 a colleague and I were talking about the demands of working across, with and beyond other disciplines. My colleague suggested that we need to get a feel for what is enough to understand or know about that discipline before engaging with the experts of those communities. But what is enough? 

In 2001, Site Magazine printed an interview by Power Ekroth and Swen-Olov Wallenstein with Jens Hoffman called _Interdisciplinary Laboratory_.[1]  In it, Wallenstein describes a phenomenon called _used-car syndrome_ that he thinks was coined by the art critic [Hal Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Foster_(art_critic)). It goes like this:

 > . . .  people from different fields will always get attracted to the most conservative ideas from the other fields. This way you end up with the following equation: ‘you buy my used car, I buy your used car, and then we end up with two really shitty cars’.

At that time I was deeply engaged with working with artists from other disciplines and I remember reading of Foster's used-car syndrome as a warning: do not end up with a shitty old car. 

Now, I see such a car so differently with its dents, rust, wonky parts, and dated colours and materials that lie at the heart of creative possibilities and constraints. The metaphor generates a question of ecology: what has been made in the past that might be re-used together to help human beings see our present differently? 

The other thing that is strange, looking back, is that I failed to ask three questions: 1) Is the statement true? 2) How do I know this? 3) If it is true then why are people from different fields _attracted_ to the most conservative ideas from other fields? At the very least, I wanted the used-car syndrome to be true because it propped up my ambitions to create _newness_ – something I remember [Nancy Stark-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Stark_Smith) describing as a kind of cult.



used cars and transdisciplinarity. Iove for it at Uni. Then Wendell's Sympathetic and Rational Minds

Note that used Berry in other newsletter [[children of the soil (newsletter)]]

Note also this might be useful on [[disciplinary prejudices]]

I'll finish with a bit of housekeeping:

- these brief essays are only for subscribers and are not available anywhere else online. Actually, this is not entirely true. In the spirit of working as transparently as possible, all the writing I do – including every edit! – is maintained on a version control system called Github. You can see what is called the _blame file_ for this essay at [https://github.com/skellis46/slipbox/blame/master/used%20cars.md](https://github.com/skellis46/slipbox/blame/master/used%20cars.md) A blame file is normally used to find out who wrote particular pieces of code, but in this case it enables you to track back through the different versions of this essay as I was writing it
- although I use Mailchimp to maintain and send the essays I have turned off all tracking technology. I have no idea if you are reading them or even opening the email (but I hope you are)
- if you think of someone who might like the ideas in this writing, please share it with them.
