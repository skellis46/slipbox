# weave together a new sensory fabric

Echoing Deleuze and Guattari, Rancière argues that artists transform sensation: “What the artist does is to weave   together a new sensory fabric by wresting percepts and affects from the   perceptions and affections that make up the fabric of ordinary experience.   Weaving this new fabric means creating a form of common expression   or a form of expression of the community.”[Ranciere, in @bench-2020-perpetual p.85]
