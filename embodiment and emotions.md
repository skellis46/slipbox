# embodiment and emotions

_previous note:_ [[body awareness and emotion]]

- [[the overlap between bodily and emotional feelings]]
- [[emotion, affect and internal bodily awareness]]

Article by Fuchs and Koch is a very handy overview of some of the research that has looked at the role of the body and embodiment in emotions.

> In the past decades a growing body of research on embodiment has demonstrated that not only bodily sensations, but also bodily postures, gestures and expressions are inherent components of emotional experience and tacitly influence the evaluation of persons, objects and situations as well as memory recall [@fuchs-2014-embodied p.1].

> These and related research results may be summarized as follows:
> 1. When individuals adopt or produce emotion-specific postures, facial expressions or gestures, (a) they tend to experience the associated emotions, and (b) their behavior and also their preferences, judgement and attitudes toward objects or persons are thereby tacitly influenced.
> 2. Conversely, when individuals' expressive movements are inhibited, the experiencing of the associated emotions as well as the processing of corresponding emotional information is impaired. This is even the case when the information is presented in a merely cognitive or non-expressive way (as shown by the study of Havas et al., 2010, above).

- also a genuinely interesting read vis a vis emotions
