Dear

In my line of work the word embodiment or embodied is everywhere. I imagine all jobs have similar words, although the academy seems particularly obsessed with words: what they mean now, what they meant originally, making up new ones, combining old ones together, organising which words ought to be used, which ones are no longer appropriate to use, etc. I'm more than guilty of this (as my PhD students would no doubt testify) and I wrote a brief [blog post about 'embodied' being a type of modifier](https://www.skellis.net/blog/embodied-and-disembodied) back just before the pandemic. 

Neuroscientists use the acronym EBO -- the experience of body ownership -- to describe our sense of having (or owning!) a particular body, and how it is an important aspect of selfhood. That is, the sensations of the body help us create a sense that we are a subject or a self in the world. 

There's a lot of scientific research on body ownership or what is also called the body transfer illusion, and the rubber-hand illusion (RHI) is described by Anil Seth as the "cornerstone of research on embodiment". The illusion was first described in 1998 by [Botvinick and Cohen](https://www.nature.com/articles/35784) (only 2981 citations) and it goes as follows.

The participant sits with both hands at a table and a partition between their hands which means they cannot see their right hand. Instead, a rubber right hand is visible to them on the table. That is they can see their real left hand and a fake right hand, while their real right hand is out of sight.

By Laura E Downey, Phillip Fletcher, Hannah L Golden, Colin J Mahoney, Jennifer L Agustus, Jonathan M Schott, Jonathan Rohrer, Jon Beck, Simon Mead, Martin N Rossor, Sebastian James Crutch, Jason Warren - https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Figure3-Schematic-diagram-of-the-experimental-set-up-in-the-rubber-hand-illusion-task_fig4_260168359, CC BY 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=149337823

The experimenter then brushes both the fake right hand and the real right hand in the same direction and at the same time. After a while the participant starts to experience the rubber hand as their own and when asked to point to their right hand (with their real left hand) they point to the rubber hand. Or, if the rubber hand is threatened (with a needle for example) they show neurological evidence of anticipating pain.

This shows you the setup pretty clearly (with a most excellent surprise at the end):

Crucially, the rubber hand illusion is different from visual illusions because rather than being completed surprised or sensorially overwhelmed by the illusion, "the typical experience in the rubber hand illusion is of somehow feeling the fake hand to be part of one’s body, while clearly knowing that it isn’t" (Seth 2021 loc 2609). 

I love this idea of how _feeling_ the body is different from _knowing_ something about it. But what is curious is that while practicing dance improvisation I have almost the opposite experience. My body feels as if it is not mine while I know that it is.

I'm going to stop here rather abruptly and next month will pick up some ideas and experiments around the RHI that I think are fascinating regarding body-based practices like dance.

Thanks for reading and please do share this mini-essay if you think of someone interested in rubber hands and ideas about body ownership and embodiment.

Simon.
