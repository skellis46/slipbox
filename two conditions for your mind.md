# two conditions for your mind

_previous note:_ [[alive or dead? I'm not saying]]

> Zhaozhou often quoted this saying by Sengcan:
“The great way is not difficult if you just don’t pick and choose.”
> A KOAN SHOWS YOU TWO conditions for your mind: a with and a without condition. This is a natural way to understand things—life as a botox advertisement in which you are shown a haggard, careworn face, with wrinkles, and then the improved version, smooth as a baby’s backside, without wrinkles. A koan uses this natural eagerness to compare things in an interesting way: when you work with the koan, what you are either with or without is your map, your cherished beliefs, your story about how your life should be at the moment in which you find yourself.
> The with condition is what, in an unexamined way, you believe to be true. Beliefs have consequences; they build their own fictional world. When you believe something, you usually want the world to agree with you, to back up your story. Of course it rarely does, so your story will come with conflict built into its plotline. In the without condition, you see the world without wanting it to be different from the way it is. The without condition is an act of imagination. You ask yourself, “What might the world look like if I loved it as it is, just as it is?” Here is a koan that shows the power of imagining life when you are not depending on the stories you usually tell yourself. It also can show you what life is like in the with condition when your maps of the world vary from the actual territory of the world.[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 10 The Great Way is Not Difficult, n.pag.]
