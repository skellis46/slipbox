# technology and the constitution of being

_previous note:_ [[inquiry is not thinkable without the knowing subject]]

Brian Massumi attempts to describe why Simondon's work became increasingly relevant across science and humanities and social sciences, and in particular how technology has played a critical role in the overlap of these "opposing camps."[@massumi-2009-technical p.37] He's not specific about the technologies he is discussing, but alludes to biotechnology.

>The question of technology was now directly a question of the constitution of being--in a word, ontology. Or more precisely: because given the juncture, the question of being had to be approached from the angle of becoming; it was a question of ontogenesis. The ontogenesis at issue was constitutively entangled with modes of knowledge and their associated practices, so the problem was as directly epistemological as it was ontological.[@massumi-2009-technical p.37]

Massumi describes how Simondon's key concept of individuation "asserts the primacy of ontogenesis, a primacy of processes of becoming over the states of being through which they pass"[@massumi-2009-technical p.37]. 

How might ontogenesis be considered in relation to [[the infinite game]]?

Massumi describes how Simondon found a path to ontogenesis by bringing together ontology and epistemology. 

This article/interview is really a way for Massumi to help introduce Simondon to Western audiences, and in particular ideas to do with invention. I read it quickly (skimmed really).

- first introduction for me to William James' [[radical empiricism]] and how Massumi states that Simondon has some connection with James' thinking
