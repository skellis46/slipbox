# the distinction between body–mind and mind–body experience

_previous note:_ [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

> Within somatic work, there is a distinction between body-mind and mind-body experience based on whether awareness is being directed by the ‘mind’ or whether awareness emerges from the body and is recognised by the cortex (Eddy, 2008). The difference is that instead of ‘thinking’ about the body, we ‘notice’ signals from the body through the experience of sensation.[@mullan-2014-somatics p.254] 

- reminded here of [[I move precedes I can]] almost as if "I can" is a thought about capacity, but not necessarily the capacity itself
- see also [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing]] and the ownership of the body and consciousness. That even the capacity to 'notice' signals from the body is recognition that this is _my_ body. How does this distinction sit in Damasio's sensing-feeling-knowing concept? Curious how 'sensation' seems so distant from the kind of sensing Damasio discusses -- sensing that is utterly primal and common to all organisms.
