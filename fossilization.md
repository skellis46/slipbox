# fossilization

_previous note:_ [[habitual ways of seeing]]

> ... improvement in one's interlanguage may stop or greatly slow down, which is referred to as _fossilization_. Once you reach a point where you are able to do most of the things you want in a language, you no longer have the need to keep improving. Because you are generally intelligible, native speakers may stop correcting minor errors, as long as they do not interfere with intelligibility. This may lead you to stop expecting their feedback, causing you to believe that you have achieved a certain level of mastery, when in fact you have not.[@roberts-2016-becoming p.47]
