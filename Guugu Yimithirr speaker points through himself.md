# Guugu Yimithirr speaker points through himself

_previous note:_ [[saeculum]]

> But one piece of evidence is telling: if you saw a Guugu Yimithirr speaker pointing at himself, you would naturally assume he meant to draw attention to himself. In fact, he is pointing at a cardinal direction that happens to be behind his back. While we are always at the center of the world, and it would never occur to us that pointing in the direction of our chest could mean anything other than to draw attention to ourselves, a Guugu Yimithirr speaker points through himself, as if he were thin air and his own existence were irrelevant.[@deutscher-2010-does n.pag.]

- possibly useful in considering [[the body in the Anthropocene]]
