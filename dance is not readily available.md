# dance is not readily available

You may or may not know that dance in UK Higher Education is in a precarious state. Undergraduate dance programmes are being closed (and have been for many years) and we are fast running out of places in which people can study dance as a practice and to understand its place and role in being human. 

In their book *The Dawn of Everything* David Graeber and David Wengrow describe "extremely human activities" like "gossiping, arguing, playing games, dancing or travelling for pleasure." They weren’t talking about moderately human activities or bog-standard human activities. Nope. *Extremely* human activities.

When thinking about making a case for why dance is important in Higher Education, I like to think the logic goes that Universities ought to be places in which the state thinks it intrinsically valuable to advance human understanding, including our understanding of human culture itself. But that “ought to” ship sailed a long time ago and Universities are mired in the logic (if one can call it such a thing) of economic-value-growth-is-king. 

I’ve mentioned the German-born American philosopher Albert Borgmann before in this newsletter. He has this concept of the device paradigm in which the mechanism for the delivery of a commodity is hidden. The device paradigm also relates to _availability_. Here’s technology writer L.M. Sacasas:

> Availability is a characteristic of technology which answers to technology’s promise of liberation and enrichment. Something is technologically available, Borgmann explains, “if it has been rendered instantaneous, ubiquitous, safe, and easy.” At the heart of the device paradigm is the promise of increasing availability." (The Convivial Society, Why an Easier Life Is Not Necessarily Happier)

If I were to (reluctantly) describe dance as an essentially human technology (remembering that the etymology of the word technology derives from “to weave” and “to fabricate”), what seems clear is that it is a human technology that is not readily available in the way a smartphone is, or electricity, or TikTok. I’m not thinking here of dancing as an art form -- the stuff that you normally pay to watch in a theatre. Rather I’m thinking of the kind of dancing that we go out _to do_.[^warren] The kind of dancing that happens every night every where on the planet. That kind of dancing demands something of us just like any attempt to express ourselves (directly or indirectly) takes effort. 

Human beings expressing ourselves in dance is both instinctive and emergent. It is a human behaviour that is frivolous *and* consequential. It is tangible *and* fleeting. It is rendered on the surface of our bodies *while* emanating from deep within whatever it is that we might understand to be a self. 

A University seems like the ideal place to explore and be with such paradox and mystery. But if it isn’t then no matter because long after our educational institutions are gone we will still be gossiping, we will still be arguing, and we will still be dancing. 



[^warren]: If you are interested, I strongly recommend Emma Warren’s beautiful book _Dance Your Way Home A Journey Through the Dancefloor_ (2023). She captures so much of how dancing propels us into ourselves.
