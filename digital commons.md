# digital commons

... [[Bench - Perpetual Motion]] suggests that what makes dances public "is as much about exposure to onsite spectators (who may not actually be the target audience) as it is about dancing in venues that are available and accessible to the general public."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.64] These kinds of dances in public use the digital commons to circulate and provide audiences.[@bench-2020-perpetual] Need to critique digital commons? Bench's digital commons are distinct from these: 

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_%28economics%29>; 
- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Commons_(Elsevier)> 
- (plenty of issues with Elsevier: <https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/elsevier-academic-publishing-petition/427059/>)

But perhaps the biggest oversight is Bench describing these digital commons as a mechanism for distribution and circulation. They are a mechanism for extraction and consumption. 

I find Bench's position on the digital commons somewhat confusing/ambiguous. The common is her fundamental lens to understand the transmission and circulation of dance. She recognises how the "participatory commons appeals as an alternative to the extractive neoliberal financial logics that govern much of contemporary life."[@bench-2020-perpetual p.4] equivocation? or just recognising the paradox? But why no mention of this is not an alternative at all. Touches on this
