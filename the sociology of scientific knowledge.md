# the sociology of scientific knowledge

_previous note:_ [[interpretation remains present]]

> The sociology of knowledge starts with the obvious but remarkably little-understood idea that nearly everything we know comes from the groups and locations in which we are brought up and, to a lesser extent, immersed in later life.[@collins-2022-science n.pag.]

At first, science seemed to exist outside of this idea; scientific knowledge was true for everyone everywhere. Kuhn's _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ started to loosen this exception. 

The sociology of scientific knowledge is an attempt to understand the ways in which science practices and understandings are socialised and encultured. It is discussed in a conversation between M. Anthony Mills (editor for The New Atlantis) and sociologist of science Harry Collins. 

Collins' contribution to this scholarship centred on the concept of the [[experimenter's regress]]. 

> Sociology of scientific knowledge caused a huge fuss because its relativism seemed to put science’s ability to stand above the sociology of knowledge in doubt — it seemed to challenge the idea that science is exceptional. At best, the methodology had uncovered uncertainty where before there had been a kind of “magical” certainty surrounding scientific truth. When one investigated science in real time, or with the right kind of historical sensibility, you found that things were never as clear as they were in the retrospective myths.[Collins, in @collins-2022-science n.pag.]
