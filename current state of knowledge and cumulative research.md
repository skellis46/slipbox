# current state of knowledge and cumulative research

_previous note:_ [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]]

Biggs and Büchler dig into the heart of the nature of research. In the following overly long direct quote they sum up the responsibilities of researchers to understand the relationship of their work and curiosity to what has been, what is happening and even what might be (in the sense of making propositions). In doing so, they underscore the vitality of archival processes in research:

> However, academic research is different in that it requires the discovery of something that nobody knows, not just something that the researcher didn’t know, and that is what makes it cumulative. In this academic usage, the individual researcher needs to find out what has already been found out: what is the current state of knowledge, the current state of imagery, and so on. One of the implications of this situation is that the outcomes of research must be archived, must be stored in some way so as to make them accessible, so that others can ascertain what it is that is already known or understood ...[@biggs_eight_2008 p.9]
