# undistracted non-meditation

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself - somatics chapter]]

This is an excerpt from the talk. It's the same in the dancing: undistracted non-dancing. 

 > And so we practice relaxation, we practice non-doing. But in the relaxation of not doing, we also need to take care that the fact that a Viriya of energy remains strong, that we're practicing with a careful and caring continuity of awareness. And there's a phrase in the Dzogchen tradition which really captures this particular balance in practice. It talks about undistracted non-meditation. So I like that, that's what we're doing. We're practicing undistracted non-meditation. But if we practice non-doing, the non-meditation part, without the requisite Viriya, then relaxation easily transforms into quite a casual attitude about our practice, about what's arising. We have forgotten the undistracted part of undistracted non-meditation. So it's not enough not to do, we have to not do in a very undistracted way. So that's where the power is. Now that's where the beauty of all of this is. -- Joseph Goldstein
