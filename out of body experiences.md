# out of body experiences

_previous note:_ [[the act of perceiving itself coming to awareness]]

> The OBE-like experiences that sometimes accompany epileptic seizures can also be traced to disruptions in these processes. These experiences are usually divided into autoscopic hallucinations – in which you see your surroundings from a different perspective – and heautoscopic hallucinations (also known as doppelgänger hallucinations) – in which you see yourself from a different perspective.
