#  Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices

> Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscience has witnessed a shift from predominantly abstract and computational views of the mind, to more embodied and situated views of the mind.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]

Identifies Varela as one of first to introduce term _embodied mind_ (p.1), and _enactive approach_:

> According to the “enactive approach” to cognition (Thompson and Varela, 2001; Thompson, 2005; Di Paolo and Thompson, 2014), living beings are autonomous agents that actively generate and maintain their physical and psychological identities, and that enact their cognitive domains through their activities. As such, the enactive approach postulates that human beings exists intrinsically as embodied beings, and that mental functions such as perception, cognition and motivation, cannot be fully understood without reference to the physical body as well as the environment in which they are experienced (Varela et al., 1991; Thompson, 2007).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]

> The closely related “grounded theory” of cognition (Barsalou, 2008) posits that cognition (including abstract thought, conceptual knowledge and semantic memory) is grounded in the brain’s modal sensory systems, rather than being merely based on abstract computations. Similarly, the dynamical systems approach to developmental theory (Camras and Witherington, 2005), psychoanalysis (Krueger, 2002) as well as the newly emerging body-oriented methods of psychotherapy (Heller, 2012), all emphasize [p.1] that bodily sensory systems are the first to develop and that they play a fundamental role in the formation of the sense of self (Sheets-Johnstone, 1999). In sum, all these schools of thought converge on the fact that the experience of one’s self in the world as a cognizant being does not solely emerge from neural activity within the brain. Instead, it involves a complex interplay of brain, body and environment, and the seamless integration of interoceptive, proprioceptive (including vestibular), kinesthetic, tactile, and spatial information (Ehrsson, 2007; Haselager et al., 2012; Ionta et al., 2011).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased pp.1-2]

- just noting the S-J citation above, and role in production of self. See also notes at bottom of [[situated and embodied cognition#^4c3eae]] regarding container, package, self. 
- clarify difference between grounded and enacted approaches

> ... systems such as Hatha Yoga, Qigong, Tai Chi, the Alexander Technique, and the Feldenkrais Method [...] all involve an explicit emphasis on attending to interoceptive, proprioceptive and kinesthetic qualities of experience. They also use concepts such as “being in one’s body” to encourage an embodied experience of the self.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2]

- above blockquote is a very particular use of the word embodied. It's akin to how [[the word embodied is a modifier]] in which the attention to the body is foregrounded. As if to underline the unusualness of such attention. This is not to say the the lack of such attention makes for a disembodied sense of the self -- or perhaps it does? That the awareness of 'body' (conventionally, or under normal circumstances for humans) recedes profoundly into the background. It also seems that Schmalzl is using the word _embodied_ in quite a precise way, directly related to situated/embodied view of mind (based on interplay of brain, body and environment) and that practices like the one's she describes encourage "an embodied experience of the self"[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2] My thinking here implies that given we (humans) are all already living embodied lives (given embodied cognition) that these practices simply tune our sensitivity to 
- thinking here also of Kabat-Zinn describing the bodyscape practices (mentioned in [[phenomenology of merleau-ponty and embodiment in the world#^55f871]])
- MECP: "movement-based embodied contemplative practice" [@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]. Seems to me that authentic movement could easily be classed as such. e.g.:
	+ [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]] - body-fulness (very useful)
	+ [[listening and curiosity]] 
	+ [[contemplation beyond rationalization]]
	+ [[the really real]]
	+ [[unconditional positive regard]]
	+ there are other zettel that discuss authentic movement
