# minority rule

_previous note:_ [[the sociology of scientific knowledge]]

In his book _Skin in the Game_ the Lebanese-American writer and statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes various scenarios in which inflexible (or intransigent) minorities determine the behaviour of the majority. 

This is written in relation to complex systems in which "the ensemble behaves in ways not predicted by the components" [@taleb-2016-most n.pag] and such a behaviours are emergent properties. It is interactions between the parts and the whole that produce emergence, and the interaction Taleb discusses here is the minority rule. 

The minority rule can be summed up as follows (although Taleb gives numerous examples), and it accounts for why peanuts are not served on planes or in schools (in the US):

> Someone with a peanut allergy will not eat products that touch peanuts but a person without such allergy can eat items without peanut traces in them.

Taleb describes how the minority rule creates a kind of illusion in which we think -- in this case -- peanut allergies are more common than they actually are.

He makes a similar case for an asymmetric rule in science which is not governed by consensus or the sum of what scientists think. Rather, science is "highly skewed" because once something is debunked (or falsified) by even a single case or test that idea becomes wrong. (see [[Jacobs - How to Think]] re falsifiability and Karl Popper)

It gets more serious though:

> Let us conjecture that the formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus. No, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance. The same can apply to civil rights.[@taleb-2016-most n.pag.]

> Clearly can democracy--by definition the majority--tolerate enemies? The question is as follows: “Would you agree to deny the freedom of speech to every political party that has in its charter the banning the freedom of speech?” Let’s go one step further, “Should a society that has elected to be tolerant be intolerant about intolerance?”[@taleb-2016-most n.pag.]

Taleb's response to the question is that yes we ought to be more intolerant towards _some_ intolerant minorities, and that it's not possible to be flexible in this case. Taleb believes the West is guilty of such flexibility or tolerance and as such "The West is currently in the process of committing suicide."[@taleb-2016-most n.pag.]
