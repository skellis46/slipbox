# are you afraid of this happiness?

_previous note:_ [[service of the self]]

> Buddha’s question to himself, “Are you afraid of this happiness?” implies that we can be afraid of happiness. Happiness is a great risk to your own sense of yourself. You have to forget who you are in order to be happy, or to do anything wholeheartedly. Often what you might think of as yourself is a list of problems and achievements, particularly problems. Without a problem, you wouldn’t need anything. You could lose your citizenship in the society of people who need things. If you have a problem, you need closure, or revenge, or to understand your mother, or to have your partner meet your needs. Yet most of these things are extremely unlikely to occur. And not one of these things would bring happiness if it did occur.[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 13: The Woman at the Inn: Are You Afraid of This Happiness? n.pag.]
