# responsibility and community

_previous note:_ [[specialist and generalist audience in practice-research]]

In 2003 Peter Thomson published an article in Studies in Theatre and Performance called [Practice as Research](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljh0drk7kmnec88/thomson-2003-practice.pdf?dl=0). The article is an edited collection of exchanges that happened online on the [SCUDD list-serv](https://scudd.org.uk/members/scudd-mailing-list/) in 2002. The whole exchange is fascinating, not least because it makes clear just how many of the contestable aspects of practice-research in theatre, dance and performance in 2002 remain somewhat controversial today.

In this post I want to draw attention to Caroline Rye's contribution to the exchange and I quote it at length here:

> Maybe the assumption is that the more ‘visible’ and revisitable our research, the ‘better’ that research is, and that the production of documents will facilitate this availability and confirm its quality as research. The emphasis on a repeatable form of dissemination might occur in order to maintain some notion of a ‘complete’ research community, which can have non-exclusive and unconditional access to the research in order to benefit and progress the whole ‘research’ organism.

> Wouldn’t that be a slightly simplistic model of knowledge production? Our field of performance research is a highly contested area (as is, I imagine, research in other disciplines). There is little or no consensus, and any number of contradictory ideas and beliefs can be held by any number of ‘research bodies’ at any time. To admit to this much more fractured composition of the research community may also involve the replacing the notion of the ‘academy’ with a number of ‘academies’.

> Additionally, we may also have to admit that some forms of knowledge are context-specific, but that, nevertheless, some kind of knowledge-exchange (modification/realization) has taken place, which is of benefit to the discipline as a whole (in the way individuals or groups might produce new work, talk, write, experience performance etc.). This is one of the challenges that PaR presents to the ‘academy’. Must, then, PaR practitioners articulate their activities in a manner which the academy finds acceptable (conventional, accessible)?

What I like about Rye's challenges (or perhaps _ambivalences_) is that they hint at a question of responsibility, and how broadly we -- artist-scholars -- might take our responsibilities. That is, we certainly have some responsibility to the specifics (and perhaps uniqueness) of the artistic practice(s), but what do we imagine our responsibilities to be towards the artistic and scholarly communities at large? To present our work in some ways might serve the form-content of the practice, but render it inaccessible or even irrelevant to the research community (or _academies_ as Rye describes). How to navigate this balance between responsibility and community?
