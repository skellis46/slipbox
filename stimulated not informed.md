# stimulated not informed

_previous note:_ 

> But let me waive the point, and say: If you’re reading the news several times a day, you’re not being _informed_, you’re being _stimulated_. Try giving yourself a break from it. Look at this stuff at wider intervals, and in between sessions, give yourself time to think and assess.
