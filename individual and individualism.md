## individual: literally “not divisible.”
- **Root:** Latin **indivīduus** = “indivisible” (**in-** ‘not’ + **dīvīduus** ‘divisible’, from **dīvidere** ‘to divide’).
- **Scholastic Latin:** **individuum** used as a noun for an indivisible entity, often to translate Greek **ἄτομον** (_átomon_, “indivisible/atom”).   
- **Into English:** via Medieval Latin (and Old French **individuel**) as **individual** (adj.) in late Middle English meaning “indivisible, single.”
- **Sense shift:** by the 17th century the noun came to mean “a single human person,” broadening from the metaphysical “indivisible unit” to “one person among others.”

## Individualism** = **individual** + **-ism** (“doctrine/practice of”).
- **Immediate source:** French **individualisme** (early 19th c.), popularized by Alexis de Tocqueville in _De la démocratie en Amérique_ (1835).
- **Suffix:** **-ism** comes via Latin **-ismus** from Greek **-ismos**, forming names of doctrines or tendencies.
- **Sense history:** first used in political-social debate to contrast personal autonomy/self-interest with communal or state authority; later broadened to the value placed on the individual person and their rights.
