# to be mesmerised is to be transfixed

_previous note:_ [[technology forces humans to adapt]]

> To be mesmerised is to be transfixed, our bodies swept up by forces beyond our calculated clutches on reality. The term is named for the 18th century Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer who proposed the existence of an invisible fluid in the body that interacts with forces of the natural world. He called his theory 'animal gravitation.'[@bosler-2022-where p.99]
