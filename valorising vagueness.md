# valorising vagueness

This note is a collection of examples from #practice-research (and specifically JAR) in which the authors express vagueness in relation to their work. These examples are taken from an early draft of the case for support for #finger-pointing-moon. What is not clear is the line between vagueness and academic humility. That implicit in their language is the acknowledgement that none of their work is certain or clear, and indeed whether this is a bug or a feature

> Most recently, the Journal of Artistic Research publishes what are called expositions of practice; a term underpinned by Rheinberger’s theory of experimental systems. Expositions focus on “particular knowledges” and implicitly valorise vagueness.

> Here are two examples from the Journal of Artistic Research (2020 Vol 20, emphasis added): "_hopefully_ as you continue to read and listen, _it will become gradually clearer_" -- Miller; "with this text I’m really _not trying to make any grand statements_. It is a _collection_ of words and decisions that function more as a _demonstration_ ..." -- Norman.

> It is important to note that with this text I’m really not trying to make any grand statements. It is a collection of words and decisions that function more as a demonstration of how I think about composition.

- no effort at all to present findings 
- demonstration / process
- "trying to understand" - does he mean for him or the reader? 
- description of process; justification of choices
- no mention of any other practice-research
- no reference list

> Although the methodologies of my practice-based research are built on a cyclic model of research questions and investigative processes, the outcomes do not provide definitive answers. As artistic productions, they are necessarily speculative, suggesting open-ended conclusions that could form the basis of future work. 

- gets stuck in languages of 'practice-led' etc
- probably the most 'useful' in this collection: clear sense of inquiry
- is the future work expected to be less open-ended, vague or inconclusive?

> In this context, the open-endedness of artistic research allows the possibility for the ongoing development of new insights among the wider community of creative practitioners.

- description of process
- justification of decisions made (this is a common trait)

> Does this approach answer the general, introductory questions that were posed in relation to meaning and communication? If the audience needs to be given a context or a translation in order to appreciate a piece of music, does this not undermine the idea that the communicative power of the music is sufficient in and of itself? Similarly, if the piece is performed without any contextual information such as a translation or programme note, what (if anything) can the audience be expected to gain, other than perhaps a generalised sense of emotion?

- focus on process: "Recording these nuanced journeys and explorations are essential as contributions of research to studying practice."
- reads like a review or overview
- no justification of claims.

> However, tracing this thread of consciousness through practice allows for a nuanced study of a lineage that goes back over seven-thousand years of human history. These intangible yet powerful links to ancient creative processes remain contemporary, relevant, and essential for ecological justice for all beings.

## Andrew Miller

> At first the environment that these artefacts attempted to make sense of will be blurry, but hopefully as you continue to read and listen, it will become gradually clearer, until you are able to grasp it as being present, the artefacts, practices, yourself and the environment become inherently meaningful to one another as part of a process of sense-making.

- little if any sense of audience. Who is this for? why might it matter? 
- presentation of practice. some kind of record of practice/process. that's it.
- definitely more towards "intrinsic position" as I described in very early drafts of CfS for #finger-pointing-moon. See here: <https://github.com/skellis46/finger-pointing-moon/commit/07e342124d41ee6b27e0c5fd28b97c50bcf2b3bf> ^ac1336

> to understand the process of sense-making as mediated by the interaction of artistic practices

- it's so blurry. Whose artistic practices? What kinds of mediation? What is 'sense-making'? And is the point to understand the process and if so how does this project afford that? 
- almost entirely self-referential
- description of process
- little to no engagement with other practice-research
- who is it in relation to?
- mentions Noë and Borgdorff in reference list but can't find in the exposition

> This Exposition provides a space for reflection on the processes of production used in the making of my moving image piece. It is a case study to share observations and findings, and deepen my understanding of the issue of practice as research within a creative process.

> While these films suggest an ethnographic approach, they do not have the systematic approach required by an ethnographic study, although they provide insight and knowledge, and place an audience close to the subject.

- but what insight and knowledge? 
- does talk about other artists (mostly from the canon of experimental film)
- doesn't discuss other artist-researchers, or how his work overlaps with other practice-research

> I hope this serves adequately as a case study for those working in creative research.
