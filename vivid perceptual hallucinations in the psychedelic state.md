# vivid perceptual hallucinations in the psychedelic state

_previous note:_ [[the essence of selfhood is about your body]]

> In the psychedelic state, vivid perceptual hallucinations are frequently accompanied by unusual experiences of selfhood often described as ‘ego dissolution’, where the boundaries between self and world, and other people, appear to shift or dissolve. These departures from ‘normal’ conscious experience are so pervasive that the psychedelic state might represent not only a change in conscious contents, but also a change in overall conscious level.
