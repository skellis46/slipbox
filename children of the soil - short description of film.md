#  children of the soil - short description of film

_previous note:_ 

Children of the soil is a short film that emerged from a simple physical practice of falling slowly to the ground. It uses text and still and moving images in a sequence of graphic-novel-like panels to explore the slow work of growth, death, gravity and decay. The film acts as a gentle reminder that each of us is always becoming earth and soil for our human – and other-than-human – ancestors.
