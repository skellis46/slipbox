# art practice and artistic research

_previous note:_  [[human experience and language]]

---

In _The Conflict of the Faculties_ (2012) Henk Borgdorff makes the relationship between art practice and artistic research very plain indeed. Art practice provides the context for the research (alongside the academy), and through artistic research is able to contribute new insights to discourses on art, and create "new products and experiences which are meaningful in the world of art".[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.146] This fact -- that the outcomes of artistic research are generated through art practice -- distinguishes artistic research from other fields in which art practice might be "the object of the research, but not the outcome".[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.146] Borgdorff sums up his thinking by writing that "art practice is paramount as the subject matter, the method, the context, and the outcome of artistic research."[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.146]

_questions & thoughts:_

- I can think of no other field of study that adopts this approach. Perhaps in some ways visual anthropology works in this way? Others? Borgdorff certainly claims that it is what makes practice-research unique:

>We can justifiably speak of artistic research (‘research in the arts’) when that artistic practice is not only the result of the research, but also its methodological vehicle, when the research unfolds in and through the acts of creating and performing. This is a distinguishing feature of this research type within the whole of academic research. [@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.147]

- this is critical for #finger-pointing-moon because HB clearly makes a case for what I describe as an _intrinsic_ approach to practice-research (see [[valorising vagueness]] that mentions [note on github](https://github.com/skellis46/finger-pointing-moon/commit/07e342124d41ee6b27e0c5fd28b97c50bcf2b3bf)). It also implies for that project that its design is only part practice-research (the work on authentic movement).
