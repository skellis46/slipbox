# a disinvestment in emotionality 

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

> To train this spirit, the original 'subtle knife', requires a disinvestment in emotionality and a return to the True Lead of genuine feeling. Everything about this method runs counter to the prevailing currents for identification with (so-called) self, investment in emotions and preoccupation with identity over behaviour.
