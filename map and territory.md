# map and territory

_previous note:_ [[truth and beliefs]]

---

Yudkowsky describes a piece of rationalist fiction by A. E. van Vogt called the _Null-A series_. The protagonist Gilbert Gosseyn has a particularly rationalist skill that is captured by Gosseyn's slogan: _The map is not the territory._

The concept of map and territory is the distinction between a representation of a thing, and the thing itself. In this blog post Yudkowsky focuses on the skill of seeing one's beliefs inside a thought bubble (with reality outside) rather than simply employing our maps to consider reality directly. 

Yudkowsky mentions also the idea that we must remember that it's conceivable that we are wrong. This is the proverb:

>Your belief in that does not make it so.[@yudkowsky_skill_2012 n.p.]

_thoughts & links:_

- I've written so many times, "just because you say it does not make it so"
- see also Wikipedia page on [map-territory relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation)
- I'm really interested in the idea of maps as necessary abstractions. That any form of language is an approximation of what we wish to communicate. This is how we are only ever #finger-pointing-moon. The finger becomes a form of map, and is only ever able to point in the general direction of the moon (as territory)
- see [[apophatic theology]] for a different take on the map -- more akin to a series of anti-maps or inverse maps. This is very useful for #practice-research and #finger-pointing-moon
