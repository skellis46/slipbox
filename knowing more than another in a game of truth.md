# knowing more than another in a game of truth

_previous note:_ [[somatic education as a technology of the self]]

> I see nothing wrong in the practice of a person who, knowing more than other in a specific game of truth, tells those others what to do, teaches them, and transmits knowledge and technique to them. The problem in such practices where power – which is not bad in itself – must inevitably come into play is knowing how to avoid the kind of domination effects where a kid is subjected to the arbitrary and unnecessary authority of a teacher, or a student put under the thumb of a professor who abuses his authority. I believe that this problem must be framed in terms of practices of the self and freedom.(Foucault 1988: 40) [@fortin-2009-experience p.50]

- contrast with [[the infinite game]]
