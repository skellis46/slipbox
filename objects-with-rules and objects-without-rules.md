# objects-with-rules and objects-without-rules

_previous note:_ [[the infinite game]]

> She opened her mouth to answer, but discovered she didn't know the answer. Right up until that moment she'd felt like she had some intuitive sense of which things were objects-with-rules and which ones were objects-without-rules, felt it so readily that she hadn't even named the two categories until just that instant. Now that she tried to come up with a rule to explain the difference between the two, she found she couldn't.[@doctorow-2019-radicalized p.44] 

It's not clear to me why I chose this quote but the two categories -- objects-with-rules and objects-without-rules -- are fascinating, and in particular our capacity to understand or recognise the distinction.
