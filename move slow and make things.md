# move slow and make things

Facebook's original internal motto was – rather famously – _move fast and break things_. Google's was _Do no evil_. Neither seem to have aged particularly well. Even Zuck thought so and in 2014 he changed the Facebook motto to "Move fast with stable infrastructure" -- any motto with the word 'infrastructure' in it is going to be a humdinger:

- Just infrastructure it (Nike)
- Be infrastructured (Boy Scouts)
- Lend an infrastructure (Brownies)
- For the Faith and For the Infrastructure of Mankind (St John Ambulance)
- Uphold the infrastructure (Victoria Police)
- Faster, higher, infrastructurer (Olympics)

I'll stop there else I might be accused of being silly. 

For years now I've simply enjoyed _move slow and make things_ as my own internal motto. It is sustainable and it helps focus my attention on what feels worthy within our short lives. 

I recognise, looking back some 5 to 10 years ago, that as a choreographer I simply got tired of the machinations and resources required to produce, sell and tour a performance. I never really got to the point where I was successful enough in that world for any momentum to kick in. Rather, each new work meant ratcheting up the energy and money to make something that often would only be seen once, twice, maybe three times if I was lucky. 

This is one of the reasons I now almost exclusively make videos. The (emotional and financial) resources required are far fewer, and they can be seen anywhere and anytime. The pleasure in making these works is in part sustained by how they persist in time. They help me continue to move slowly and to make things. 

The anthropologist Tim Ingold writes beautifully of making:

> I want to think of making, instead, as a process of growth. This is to place the maker from the outset as a participant in amongst a world of active materials. These materials are what he has to work with, and in the process of making he ‘joins forces’ with them, bringing them together or splitting them apart, synthesising and distilling, in anticipation of what might emerge. [...] To read making longitudinally, as a confluence of forces and materials, rather than laterally, as a transposition from image to object, is to regard it as such a form-generating – or morphogenetic – process. (Ingold, "Making" 2013)

Ingold's words are a reminder that when humans make things we participate in the world through time. Yet recently I started to think that I've nearly completely removed myself from efforts to share the work I have made. I haven't been sending my films to film festivals and I only occasionally send them directly to people to watch. My concern here is that my focus on making is a means to bypass the sense of fear that accompanies having art seen in public. That is, removing myself from the displaying-art-world has become a personal necessity out of which I am attempting to make a virtue by focusing on moving slowly and making things.

My mother Gabrielle Anne Eastwood-Ellis was a prolific writer, yet she never once tried to have any of her writing published. She was also my last remaining sure-fire audience. Regardless of what I had made (or written), and what it was about, she would watch or read it. How strange it is in my 50s to feel so deeply that profound sense of _knowing_ that comes with recognising a parent's love and duty to look at and appreciate what their child has made. And how strange it is for her not to be there ... although she gave me her writing when she died.

And so, last autumn I submitted a film – [Force Majeure](https://www.skellis.net/force-majeure) – to a festival, and this year I've submitted that and [Children of the Soil](https://www.skellis.net/children-of-the-soil) to some other festivals. I'm not sure about this at all, but dipping my feet in that displaying-art-world again seems like a good idea, even if only to check the temperature of the water.
