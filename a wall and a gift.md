I recently read God's Hotel (2013) by [Victoria Sweet](https://www.victoriasweet.com). It's a remarkable book about Sweet's experience working as a physician in an almshouse in San Francisco called the Laguna Honda. The book was many things for me: the beauty and wonder of care, the destructive weight of neoliberal values, and the power of the smallest and most delicate of stories about human beings surviving and dying. 

I thought I'd share with you two quotes from the book about the etymology of the word community. Clearly this version of my newsletter is a choreography-free zone. 

> Community comes from the Latin communio, for which the Oxford Latin Dictionary gives two derivations. Communio as a verb comes from munio—wall—and means “to build a wall around.” So a community is defined by the wall—symbolic or otherwise—around it. Everything inside the wall is the community, and everything outside the wall isn’t. (Sweet 2013: location 2804)

> But communio as a noun derives from munis—gift; so communio also means “those who share a gift in common.” That was true of the hospital’s community, too, though it was not as obvious as the wall. At the Teals’ wedding, when I saw almost all of Laguna Honda pouring into that church, sitting rapt during their vows, and, yes, even crying, I understood that it wasn’t only me who was interested in the Teals, who made time, who was touched by them. Almost everyone was there; the wedding was a gift we shared in common, and that sharing made us a community. (Sweet 2013: location 2810)

Regular readers of this newsletter will recognise just how much I enjoy a paradox and there we have a beauty: a community is both a wall and a gift. I wonder how each of us in the communities to which we belong are able to see with lucid eyes both the walls and the gifts.
