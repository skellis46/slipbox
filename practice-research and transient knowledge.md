# practice-research and transient knowledge

_previous note:_ [[thomson - practice as research]]

In the [PARIP list-serv conversation](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=PARIP) compiled by Peter Thomson, Caroline Rye[^1] writes:

>... we feel that the academy should be more alive to the epistemological challenge that the idea of PaR presents _per se_ and therefore able to create models and practices which can acknowledge and value the transient types of knowledge which it perhaps creates?[Rye, in @thomson_practice_2003 p.165]

[^1]: Caroline Rye was a postdoctoral researcher on the [PARIP project](https://www.bris.ac.uk/parip/).

_thoughts & links:_

- What did Rye mean by "transient types of knowledge"? Was she referring to the apparent ephemerality of performance? Knowledge that disappears? What might that be? How might it be useful? 
- consider that transience as an epistemic concept is acting as a proxy -- a way of keeping the epistemic work of performance at arm's length
- curious that her thinking is also hinting at how #practice-research might challenge the Academy (as seen in questions in [[early questions for practice-research]])
