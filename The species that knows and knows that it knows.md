# the species that knows and knows that it knows

_previous note:_ [[Kabat-Zinn - Wherever You Go, There You Are]]

> But I like to point out, if we have a moment for this, Krista, is that we call ourselves homo sapien sapiens. That’s the species name we’ve given ourselves. And that means from the Latin sapere, which means “to taste” or “to know.” The species that knows and knows that it knows. So that means really awareness and meta-awareness. And it would be nice if that were actually true, but I think it’s a little premature to call ourselves that. And now maybe we need to live ourselves into owning that name by cultivating awareness and awareness of awareness itself and let that be in some sense the guide as to what we’re going to invest in, how we’re going to make decisions about where we live, where we’re going to send our kids to school, how we’re going to be at the dinner table. Whether we’re going to take our bodies and our children and our parents for granted or whether we’re going to live life as if it really mattered moment by moment.

> And that’s not some kind of prescription for more stuff that you need to do in order to be happy. This is getting out of your own way long enough to realize that you already have the potential for tremendous well-being and happiness right here, right now. Nothing else has to change.

> One thing it does is it really slows down time. When you’re in the present moment, time really stops.

> We call ourselves homo sapien sapiens, which means “to taste,” to sense,” or “to know.” This is one of, I think, the great tragedies of our species so far is that so much beauty, science, art, music, poetry comes out of the human mind. And so much mayhem comes out of the same human mind, same human heart. In a sense — because in some sense we don’t know how to run the apparatus that we’ve been given and sometimes it takes over. And on good days just blinds us and we sort of make mistakes. On bad days, it blinds us to other people’s pain, and we can create an enormous amount of pain in the world out of our own pain and of our own ignorance and out of our own ambitious greediness, I guess I’d call it, to want things to be different “so that I will feel better.” If we’re not careful, we wind up with the kind of conceit that we are the center of the universe. It’s an occupational hazard of being packaged in a body, that the whole universe is outside and you are obviously the center of it, and you relate to it through all your senses, including potentially this capacity for knowing. That, to me, is kind of a working definition of meditation. ^430821

> But can we learn how to pour some energy into what’s already OK with us? Which you could call health in the most profound of ways, our own interface with not only the outer world but also the interior world of our own thoughts, our own emotions, our own sensory experience, in ways that would actually have some degree of balance, some degree of interrelationality, because all the senses are actually interrelational. And so, while you’re the center of the universe, OK, so is everybody else. So is everybody else. So that means in a sense there’s no center. Cosmologists know this. Topologists know this. There’s no center and there’s no periphery.
> But the question is what if we were to take the name we gave our species seriously and actually train to familiarize ourselves with the full perspective, the full dimensionality of what it means to be really human? For learning, for growing, healing, and for that matter, transformation across the whole lifespan.

_thoughts & links:_

- [[awareness-ing]]
- note how [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]] undermines the sense of the packaged body. That we extend ourselves into the world. [[Kabat-Zinn - Wherever You Go, There You Are]] describes this profound connectedness in the Afterword of the book (although not in the same ways that [[Murphy Paul - The Extended Mind]] does. ^7c3a0d
