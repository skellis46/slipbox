# network self and social identities

_previous note:_ [[4e cognition]]

Kathleen Wallace is a philosopher of the ethics and metaphysics of personal identity. She wrote a book called _The Network Self: Relation, Process, and Personal Identity (2019)._ She outlines her thinking in this article for Aeon. 

> Recognising the influence of these factors, some philosophers have pushed against such reductive approaches and argued for a framework that recognises the complexity and multidimensionality of persons. The network self view emerges from this trend. It began in the later 20th century and has continued in the 21st, when philosophers started to move toward a broader understanding of selves. Some philosophers propose narrative and anthropological views of selves. Communitarian and feminist philosophers argue for relational views that recognise the social embeddedness, relatedness and intersectionality of selves. According to relational views, social relations and identities are fundamental to understanding who persons are.

> Social identities are traits of selves in virtue of membership in communities (local, professional, ethnic, religious, political), or in virtue of social categories (such as race, gender, class, political affiliation) or interpersonal relations (such as being a spouse, sibling, parent, friend, neighbour). These views imply that it’s not only embodiment and not only memory or consciousness of social relations but the relations themselves that also matter to who the self is. What philosophers call ‘4E views’ of cognition – for embodied, embedded, enactive and extended cognition – are also a move in the direction of a more relational, less ‘container’, view of the self. Relational views signal a paradigm shift from a reductive approach to one that seeks to recognise the complexity of the self. The network self view further develops this line of thought and says that the self is relational through and through, consisting not only of social but also physical, genetic, psychological, emotional and biological relations that together form a network self. The self also changes over time, acquiring and losing traits in virtue of new social locations and relations, even as it continues as that one self.


_thoughts & links:_

- [[the radical hypothesis of embodiment]]
- [[4e cognition]]
- fascinated by the construction "in virtue of". I understand it but in this context it is rather odd (but not sure why)
- use of the word 'container' in relation to the self is useful, and am reminded of [[the species that knows and knows that it knows#^7c3a0d]] in which Kabat-Zinn describes how we are "packaged in a body" and that creates such a clear delineation between outside and inside.
- I really like the slightly paradoxical idea of the networked self, although am suspicious of our tendency to want to describe everything in relation to networks. It's a fashionable metaphor. What of _weave_ (woven self), or tessellated self, interconnected self, meshed self, etc?
