# movement from epistemology to cosmology

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

Brown and Reihana-Morunga describe a performance strategy (the [screendance LungSong](https://vimeo.com/329684504) as "movement from epistemology to cosmology"[@brown-2020-hau p.75]:

> Movement from epistemology to cosmology: LungSong attended to human and non-human breathing in relation to cultivating awareness of scientific knowledge on atmospheric layers and the seven heavens of Māori cosmology. It considered the health and wellbeing of the planet as coterminous with the health and wellbeing of the dancer engaged in the process.[@brown-2020-hau p.75]



_thoughts & links:_

- [[the weather lands in our bodies]] and going from the body to the atmosphere (also in [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]])
- but what is the nature of the relationship between epistemology and cosmology? Is one a subset of the other? How might they be visualised? is epistemology within the cosmology? 
- is the shift between the epistemic and the cosmic drawing attention to their discreteness or is it inviting imbrication? 
- reminded also (of course) of Yuk Hui's work [[Hui - Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]] in [[Lithium dancing]], [[Jacobs - from tech critique to ways of living]] and [[the Dao of butchering cows]]

Here's more on this imbrication from Brown and Reihana-Morunga:

> Research towards LungSong considered how traditions of indigenous weather knowledge might come into contact with Western science, disrupting legacies of colonization, assimilation and exploitation. Working at the site of contact between indigenous and non-indigenous knowledge and creativity, although uncertain and at times contradictory, we revealed critical zones of struggle through which acknowledgement and activation of distinct world-views opened a relational space of encounter through performance that was uneasy and unsettling. Donna Haraway describes the importance of developing these complex sites of intra-relationality as ethical ways of coming into material connection with the world, so that everybody in the contact zone is transformed by the engagement and no one knowledge system predominates (Haraway and Young 2019).[@brown-2020-hau p.76] 

- is indigenous knowledge represented by the cosmology? 
- what happens to the idea of knowledge in general here? That is, in relation to 'how something happens or functions'? I am in that world so deeply it's hard to imagine other kinds of breathing
- note Haraway's idea of the contact zone which reminds me of [[a border is not a boundary]] and [[boundaries and transgressions]]. This is from a podcast episode of [for the wild](https://forthewild.world/listen/donna-haraway-on-staying-with-the-trouble-131).
