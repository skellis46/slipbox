# movement is the principal function of the nervous system

_previous note:_ [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing]]

> Along similar lines, Llinás (2002) echoes Sperry’s earlier assertion (Sperry, 1952) movement is the principal function of the nervous system, and that most advanced functions of the cortex can be seen as elaborations of the basic need to move toward or away from environmental stimuli. The word “emotion” is derived from the Old French “emouvoir” (“to stir up or agitate”), and from the Latin roots “ex-” (out) and “-movere” (to move). Similarly, the word “attention” is derived from the root “ten” (“to stretch out toward”) (Partridge, 1966). In that sense, feeling attracted or repulsed from something, or even directing or withdrawing ones attention from something, can be seen as subtle forms of movement (Day, 1964; Sheets-Johnstone, 1999).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2]
