# borgmann, effort and focal things

_previous note:_ [[device paradigm and focal things]]

---

Christian blogger John O'Brien writes about Albert Borgmann's device paradigm and focal things. O'Brien places device paradigm in opposition to focal things "that can help us resist becoming pell-mell denizens of device paradigm".[@obrien_focal_2012 n.p.]

>Device paradigm vs. focal things and practices is therefore a useful analytic for balancing technology in our lives.[@obrien_focal_2012 n.p.]

O'Brien writes how focal things are practices that "make life meaningful" and that when developed in scale, become the basis of community and community celebration.

But, _focal things_ also take effort, or what Borgmann describes as a burden. O'Brien says "that the more “incarnational” focal activities usually require greater investment of effort than their electronic replacements."[@obrien_focal_2012 n.p.] But when we invest this effort, or get over the threshold of labour, "the burden disappears."

O'Brien believes that it is important that one loves the focal practice; it is more than something necessary. 

_questions & thoughts:_

- interested in the effort or labour required to _be_ in a focal thing, or to practice a focal thing. 
- note word "incarnational" in relation to _embodiment_ and effort; compare incarnational effort with the ease with which we in dance studies throw around the word embodiment and also in film: [[embodied structures and patterns of film]]

_consider:_

- [[intrinsic value definition]]
- [[instrumental extrinsic value definition]]
- [[art practice and artistic research]]
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]
- [[technology is skillful activity]] -- considering a more open understanding of _technology_
- [[focal activity is a convex lens]] -- O'Brien citing Borgmann, to help understand the value of focal things
- see [[the word embodied is a modifier]] as a contrast to the term incarnational that is more explicitly about investment of effort rather than the labour of justification (as a modifying word to express something unclear)
