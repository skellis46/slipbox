# technology is skillful activity

_previous note:_ [[noë - strange tools]]

Noë describes technologies as "evolving patterns of organisation" that also organise us. The word technology comes from the Greek work _technē_, meaning skill or craft.  Noë writes:

>When we think of technology, we tend to think of instruments, implements, built-up networks, and infrastructures. We think of Silicon Valley and bioengineering. But at its root, technology is skillful activity; it is the expression of expertise, intelligence, understanding, thoughtfulness.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 3. Designers by Nature, n.p.]

He describes language and writing themselves as being technologies; technologies that make it possible for us to consider things that are not present. Not only does technology extend "what we can do", it extends "what we are."[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 3. Designers by Nature, n.p.]

>We ourselves are creatures of technology through to our most intimate cores. And this is so because thinking, no less than dancing, traveling, and talking, is an organized activity. And technologies are evolving patterns of organization.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 3. Designers by Nature, n.p.]


_questions & thoughts:_

- to return to etymology (e.g. technē) is always a tricky proposition. This is because our use of language changes. We no longer think of technology as a skillful activity. That premise doesn't hold in how we use the term _technology_. When we say "technology" we mean something beyond ourselves used to make doing something easier. But his point about technologies never being static is important -- that they make problems as they solve them. They are deeply connected to thinking and practice. #moving-camera-bodies

_consider:_

- compare Noë's expanded description of technology with Ginot's description of techno-bodies: [[somatics, action and technology]]. In one sense, somatics as a way of organising/reorganising the body is a technology itself: a system for thinking-moving.
- different from a _normative_ conception of technology like how O'Brien talks of Borgman (as far as I'm aware): [[borgmann, effort and focal things]] and [[device paradigm and focal things]] (in which I also mention somatics as a technological practice)
- contrast also with [[Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]] and Hui's definitions of [[technics, techne, and technology]]
