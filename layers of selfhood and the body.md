# layers of selfhood and the body

_previous note:_ [[self is a complex interplay of brain, body and environment]]

> Underneath the layered expressions of selfhood involving memories of the past and plans for the future, before the explicit sense of personal identity, beneath the ‘I’ and even prior to the emergence of a first-person perspective and experiences of body ownership, there are deeper layers of selfhood still to be found. These bedrock layers are intimately tied to the interior of the body, rather than to the body as an object in the world, and they range from emotions and moods – what psychologists call ‘affective’ experiences – to a basal, formless, and ever-present sense of simply ‘being’ an embodied, living organism.

- re [[authentic movement]] and [[losing oneself]]
- Seth goes on (obviously) to talk about [[interoception]] at that point 

> At the very deepest layers of the self, beneath even emotions and moods, there lies a cognitively subterranean, inchoate, difficult-to-describe experience of simply being a living organism. Here, experiences of selfhood emerge in the unstructured feeling of just ‘being’. This is where we reach the core of the beast machine theory: the proposal that conscious experiences of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, happen with, through, and because of our living bodies.
