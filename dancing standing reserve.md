# dancing standing reserve

_previous note:_ [[Heidegger's standing reserve]]

**This note is from edit bin of [[Lithium dancing]]**

> If the essence of technē is poiesis, or bringing forth (Hervorbringen), then modern technology, a product of European modernity, no longer possesses the same essence as technē but is rather an "enframing" (Gestell) apparatus, in the sense that all beings become standing reserves (Bestand) for it.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag]

[[bringing-forth vs challenging-forth]]

[[Heidegger's standing reserve]]. See p.31 of [jacobs-2021-from]. They become standing reserve for TikTok. 

As social media subjects they are standing reserve; mere commodities for ... But as human beings, they are not.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

Kołakowski's definition of technology (in [[Jacobs - After Technopoly#^92c90b]]) doesn't seem so clearly related to Hui's. It seems to fit most simply into a broad understanding of the world as being able to be manipulated or perhaps automated; a world which renders technologically-driven processes invisible. At a stretch, this connects Kołakowski's thinking with Heidegger's notion of enframing (Gestell), a process of revealing and which "all beings become standing reserve"[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]—a term I will return to later in this writing. 

> For example, we challenge land to yield coal, treating the land as nothing but a reserve. The coal is then stored, "on call, ready to deliver the sun's warmth that is stored in it," which is then "challenged forth for heat, which in turn is ordered to deliver steam whose pressure turns the wheels that keep a factory running." The factories are themselves challenged to produce tools "through which once again machines are set to work and maintained."[@blitz-2014-understanding p.71]

- could rewrite this as: We challenge people to yield dance, treating these people as nothing but a reserve. The dance is then stored in the cloud,[^cloud] subjected to algorithms on call, ready to deliver the creativity and movement that is stored in their dance. This dancing turns the wheels that keep people online while serving them ads.

- note re (essentialist view of tech—see Feenberg who describes lack of clarity as to whether we are discussing attitude towards technology or the design of technologies): [[Feenberg - From Essentialism to Constructivism#^ef59e7]]

So frictionless, and clean. 4k pristine-ness. Way beyond industrial modernity in which the pleasure and play of these two young people is frictionless and clean labor of our time, in 4k. It's not even laboriousness. It is monetization of pleasure and joy without them being aware of it. These economics are hidden from the pleasure and joy of their dancing together in public.

Standing reserve is a "resource waiting to be used".[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

> Now, as a human being he is not mere standing-reserve; but as a forester he is.[@jacobs-2021-tech p.31]

as human beings they are not mere standing reserve. But as ... well, what are they? What else might I imagine them to be? Dancers? Filmmakers? Teenagers? How I identify them determines what kind of standing reserve they become. But perhaps end result is the same (thinking Zuboff here). The net effect is—based on Zuboff—the same. I see them as dancing reserve. They are a resource waiting to be used. Their screendancing is this resource. Their friendship is this resource. It's devastating. I want to see this differently. But I can't. 

> ... these acts [above re standing reserve] occur primarily by our own doing; we belong to the activity. Technological conscriptions of things occur in a sense prior to our actual technical use of [p.72] them, because things must be (and be seen as) already available resources in order for them to be used in this fashion. ... But these technical ends are never ends in themselves: "A success is that type of consequence that itself remains assigned to the yielding of further consequences." This chain does not move toward anything that has its own presence, but instead, "only enters into its circuit," and is "regulating and securing" natural resources and energies in this never-ending fashion.[@blitz-2014-understanding pp.71-72]

This circularity is a key feature of standing reserve. How might I describe the circularity of these two women in [[Lithium dancing]]? Also am reminded of [[technological forces and recursion]].

> So we have a really specific movement style that’s predicated on the technological components, and that continues to reinforce a change in the performance itself.—Alexandra Harlig[@harlig-2021-tiktok pp.204-205]
