# media are like metaphors

Neil Postman was a media theorist who took a famously skeptical stance on the role and value of technology in human culture and society. His most well-known book -- _Amusing ourselves to death: public discourse in the age of show business_[@postman-2006-amusing] -- was first published in 1985 and it reconstitutes Marshall McCluhan's famous aphorism: the medium is the message.[@mcluhan_understanding_1967] Postman argues that a message is too specific or fixed, and that media forms do not convey messages. Instead, he writes that media are "rather like metaphors, working by unobtrusive but powerful implication to enforce their special definitions of reality." [@postman-2006-amusing p.10] Postman impels us to consider that "in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself."[@postman-2006-amusing p.14]
