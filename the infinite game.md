# the infinite game

_previous note:_ [[the long now]]

In 2019 the author and "unshakable optimist"[^ss] Simon Sinek published a book called _The Infinite Game_ (2019) that popularised the work of American religious historian James Carse in business and organisational circles. Carse's book was published in 1986 and it was called _Finite and Infinite Games_. The premise of the original book is simple: "A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play."[@carse-1986-finite p.3] Carse details other differences such as finite games having temporal, spatial and numerical boundaries, while infinite games do not; finite games have agreed upon rules, whereas "the rules of an infinite game must change in the course of play."[@carse-1986-finite p.9] The higher education system -- or earning a degree -- is a finite game, education is infinite; research assessment is finite, ongoing research is infinite; producing an artistic work is a finite game, developing a practice is infinite such that "the only purpose of the game is to prevent it from coming to an end."[@carse-1986-finite pp.6-7]

Carse makes two further distinctions that are useful to consider in relation to practices of choreography, or indeed any artistic practice. The first distinction is that because finite games are meant to end, they are by definition performed for an audience. Carse describes finite play as _theatrical_ and infinite play as _dramatic_, that is "toward the open, toward the horizon, toward surprise, where nothing can be scripted."[@carse-1986-finite p.25] In infinite play, there is no audience, only players.

The second distinction is that finite and infinite games have a fundamentally different relationship to surprise. In finite games, surprise is a means by which the game might be brought to an end. To be able to surprise an opponent is a key feature of a finite game. Infinite play is predicated on ongoing surprise: "Infinite players, on the other hand, continue their play in the expectation of being surprised. If surprise is no longer possible, all play ceases."[@carse-1986-finite p.18] It is the expectation of surprise in infinite play that invites complete openness. There are no feints or strategies, deceptions or distractions. Carse describes the openness of infinite play as not being about candour but rather "vulnerability."[@carse-1986-finite p.18]

Carse wrote that the only idea that is shared across infinite and finite games is that, "Whoever must play cannot play."[@carse-1986-finite p.74] What if we all imagine that we do not _have to_ play this finite game? That by choosing to be involved -- by choosing to play -- we make the infinite game possible; that we write and dance and choreograph so that we may continue to play.

- see Bill Viola on how awareness of time brings one into a world of process [[viola - time and process]]
- [[object, process and context in practice-research]] -- I've resisted the value of process for so long but Carse's thinking has me rethinking and wondering
- see Galloway's _The Interface Effect_ [[an interface is always an effect]] and a process
- note also Galloway's connection of [process with analog philosophy](http://cultureandcommunication.org/galloway/how-to-spot-an-analog-philosopher) and also in his thinking through Massumi's 99 Theses in [[analog chauvinism and the qualitative]]
- processes of accumulation in [[dissemination, accumulation and originality]]
- primacy of processes in [[technology and the constitution of being]]
