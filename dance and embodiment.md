# dance and embodiment

Dancing is complex. Robots dancing. Even just a shuffle the kind I remember as a teenager. 
It is perhaps the least surprising thing that dance scholars and artists have latched onto research into embodied cognition:

> Proponents of embodied cognition take as their theoretical starting point not a mind working on abstract problems, but a body that requires a mind to make it function.[@wilson-2002-six, p.625]


> The relatively new academic field of “embodiment”32 is a synthesis of many fields (biology, cognitive neuroscience, and phenomenology among them). Testifying to the importance of body narrative, embodiment scholars help substantiate ideas long thought integral to a dancer’s artistry and creativity, such as “kinesthetic resonance”33 and “somaesthetics.”34 (<https://iadms.org/media/3599/iadms-resource-paper-somatic-studies-and-dance.pdf>)

- see here the [[whole physical body minus the brain]]

- embodied knowledge, embodiment, embodied intelligence
- [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]: Ginot criticises the ways in which somatics "puts scientific discourse to use" [@ginot-2010-shusterman p.13] by attempting to tread (or perhaps create) a fine line between subjective experience and objective _generalizable_ reality. 
- curious how Wilson's [[six views of embodied cognition]] (from which the 'proponent's quote above is taken) are distinctive from the ways in which McCallum distinguishes between [[situated and embodied cognition]]. Need to be very precise about how embodiment (as generally used in dance) aligns with Wilson's explication of six views. 
- curious about skin as boundary (container or package) - see [[situated and embodied cognition#^43d692]] for summary of this.
- my writing on [[the word embodied is a modifier]]
- in [[self is a complex interplay of brain, body and environment]] I start thinking through inside/outside the body, role of environment in the work of the soma. 
- [ ] go through Jonathan Burrows' podcast series for C-DaRE?
- my citation of Sheets-Johnstone <https://github.com/skellis46/finger-pointing-moon/blob/master/20191129%20-%20performance%20knowledges%20conference%20malta/20200206%20-%20corporeal%20epistemics%20-%20presentation%20plan.md> and also more specifically in _Corporeal Epistemics_ [@ellis-2020-corporeal] (see also my older drafts on GitHub when I mention other scholars using the word embody.)
- [Choinière](x-devonthink-item://98BE098F-A795-46F6-BFC9-EE06CCE00E75) [@choiniere-2018-somatica] - talks about embodiment all the time, but simply not clear what it is (used her quote in Corporeal Epistemics)

> these recent positions on the somatic bear witness to the commitment of certain artists to experiment with different forms of embodied mediation and new interpretations of embodiment.[@choiniere-2018-somatica p.196]
