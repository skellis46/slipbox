# apophenia and seeking patterns

_previous note:_ [[cognitive biases]]

---

Apophenia is the tendency to mistakenly see patterns, connections and meanings in unrelated or random things. We have a tendency to create meaning when there is none. It's a form of cognitive bias.

_questions & thoughts:_

- like any cognitive bias, I'm fascinated by how one resists (if at all possible) such things. To not fall into the trap. Kahneman discusses this in the podcast in link below (evidence and ...)
- I might argue that this zettelkasten system is a way of seeking patterns when perhaps they don't exist
- how is apophenia distinct or different from apprehending art, or interpreting art; in how we use our imaginations to _feel_ responses to certain images, ideas, sounds, sights, etc? Where are the edges of 'making sense' and 'making nonsense'?

_consider:_

- [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]]
- [[art as source of knowledge]]
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]
