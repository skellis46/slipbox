# inhuman mediation of human and planetary time

_previous note:_ [[how to think humanity as geologic and vice versa]]

- related to literature note [[Houser - Human Planetary]]

> one of the ironies of visualizing the Anthropocene is that it relies on the technologies of the very Great Acceleration that has led to the epochal break.[@houser-2016-human p.152]

> Multiple temporal seams thus run through [climate] models, and the geologic and computational temporal strata that inscribe human time become particularly poignant in the model visualizations.[@houser-2016-human p.152] 

> If we think of “modeling as world building” in line with historian Paul Edwards, then models are [p.153] artifacts of the imagination as much as they are symbiotic with data.24 As they mediate Anthropocene data and experience through strategies of temporal representation, they do the conceptual and imaginative work of engendering human-planetary ontologies.[@houser-2016-human pp.152-153]

> Holding all components of the data visualization in view at once is impossible. The user must pause the animation and convert it into a fixed frame, collocate the two time stamps, and align them with the geographical location of the colors and the colors’ meaning.
> Pausing, collocating, and correlating, toggling between stillness and movement: this viewing procedure is also an epistemological one. Without it, the piece cannot cohere as a knowledge object rather than just an alluring picture. [@houser-2016-human p.154]

> Unlike carbon calculators, which soothe by making climate disruption manageable, model visualizations agitate by producing ontological and epistemological uncertainty at the same time as they aim to manage climate information.[@houser-2016-human p.156]

> The human becomes other to itself through the fractures in temporality that model visualizations encode, or it coheres around the timescale of personal economy in calculators. These positions are inhabited as dualities just as climate consciousness is shot through, to revive Niedecker’s terms, with the geologic, the now, and the from-now-on.[@houser-2016-human p.157]
