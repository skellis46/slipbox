# ginot - epistemology of somatics

Isabelle Ginot is a dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner. This article is in part a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. Ginot also criticises the ways in which somatics "puts scientific discourse to use"[@ginot_shustermans_2010 p.13] by attempting to tread (or perhaps create) a fine line between subjective experience and objective _generalizable_ reality. 

Ginot proposes an "epistemology of somatic discourses"[@ginot_shustermans_2010 p.22]  according to three principles:

1. the ways in which somatics -- as techniques of the body -- are efficacious;
2. that somatics have acquired status as _alternative knowledge_ that is distinctive from what Ginot calls the normative physical culture;
3. that somatics itself has become a normative system with its own ideological construction.

_questions & thoughts:_

- this is a very brief summary of the article. I'll generate other notes that get into specific aspects
- this is the first substantial and careful critique of many of the central tenets of somatics I've ever read
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

_consider:_ 

- [ ] to look at the work of Godard who "shifted the question of scientific truth toward that of imaginary production" and I can then relate to Ingold's [[search for truth]]
