# ginot - epistemology of somatics

_previous note:_ [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

Isabelle Ginot is a dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner. This article is in part a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. Ginot also criticises the ways in which somatics "puts scientific discourse to use"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.13] by attempting to tread (or perhaps create) a fine line between subjective experience and objective _generalizable_ reality. 

Ginot proposes an "epistemology of somatic discourses"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.22] according to three principles:

1. the ways in which somatics -- as techniques of the body -- are efficacious;
2. that somatics have acquired status as _alternative knowledge_ that is distinctive from what Ginot calls the normative physical culture;
3. that somatics itself has become a normative system with its own ideological construction.

>  My hypothesis is the following: be hind the insistence on the singularity of each corporeality, most somatic methods have as a backdrop a homogenous, universal, ahistorical, and occidental body. Furthermore, despite the interest of Feldenkrais and others in the plasticity model—the idea that most human functions are acquired and that the nervous system is in perpetual re-articulation in relation to contextual variation—an essentialist ideal of the body reasserts itself, one that brings with it illusions of the natural and organic.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.23]

_questions & thoughts:_

- this is a very brief summary of the article. I'll generate other notes that get into specific aspects
- this is the first substantial and careful critique of many of the central tenets of somatics I've read
- mentions Shusterman's use of [[weber-fechner law]] to support his claims


> As in Shusterman's earlier works, Alexander technique and the Feldenkrais Method are explicitly and amply cited in this book. The choice of these two methods is pertinent in the first place because these two men seem to represent a critical mass of respectability in an ocean of somatic studies: this is thanks to their longevity, the number of practitioners that work in their schools, and the empirical results produced from their work.[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.20]  ^ad8209

- worth looking at the work of Godard who "shifted the question of scientific truth toward that of imaginary production"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.22]and I can then relate to Ingold's [[search for truth]]


In 2010, the dance scholar and Feldenkrais practitioner, Isabelle Ginot wrote a critique of Richard Shusterman's book _Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics_ (2008), and the way in which it attempts to apply somatic practices (specifically Feldenkrais and Alexander Techniques) as philosophical discourse. The article is called _From Shusterman’s Somaesthetics to a Radical Epistemology of Somatics_ [@ginot-2010-shusterman] and in it Ginot asks some difficult questions of somatic practices. _adjust this paragraph to focus on epistemological critique of Ginot's._ withering critique in the role of science to validate the "highly individualized"[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.15] experiences of somatic practices. 

It is the most sustained and well argued critique of somatic practices scholarship I have happened across (although also enjoyed Elise Nuding in Volume 13 of JDSP)

- useful summary at beginning of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] -- describes pedagogic, better (more virtuosic) dancing, injury prevention and rehab
