# perception of our world is bound to our bodies

_previous note:_ [[4e cognition]]

> Technology is a critical component of what I like to call the material infrastructure of our moral lives. Iâ€™m perhaps overly fond of that line, but I do think it does a decent job of capturing an important reality: we become who we are in relation to our material environment. This is true, in part, because we make our way in the world with a body. With our bodies we think and feel our way through life. Our perception of the world is inextricably bound up with our bodies, and our character is similarly bound up with the habits that write themselves on our bodies. The built environment we daily navigate and the tools we take in hand are drawn into this circuit of moral formation. They enter into the loop of mind, body, and world, shaping and being shaped by each in turn.
