# we are estranged from the feeling world of our bodies

_previous note:_ [[possible benefits of somatic practices]]

> [d]espite a culture in many ways obsessed with the body, its fitness, appearance[,] etc., we are curiously estranged from the feeling world of our bodies – from the constellations of sensation, memory, intuition, emotion, instinct[,] and dream that our bodies generate to keep us in touch with ourselves and the world. (Tufnell 2000: 10–11)
