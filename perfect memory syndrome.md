It's called _hyperthymesia_:

> Hyperthymesia, also known as hyperthymestic syndrome or highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM), is a condition that leads people to be able to remember an abnormally large number of their life experiences in vivid detail. It is extraordinarily rare, with only 62 people in the world having been diagnosed with the condition as of 2021.[3][4] One who has hyperthymesia is called a hyperthymesiac.[5]. -- <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia>
