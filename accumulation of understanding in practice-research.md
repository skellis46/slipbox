# accumulation of understanding in practice-research

## 20210209 obsidian journey:  between _artistic artefacts encode relationships_ and _somatics, action and technology_

1. [[artistic artefacts encode relationships]]
2. [[dissemination, accumulation and originality]]
3. [[conversation and understanding]]
4. [[human experience and language]]
5. [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]
6. [[somatics, action and technology]] (my sense is that this might be the most unrelated link in the _journey_)

## accumulation of understanding in practice-research

### the collision of cultures

- split between creating experiences vs creating research (but is the split as bad as Biggs and Buchler make out?] -- see [[biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research]] and [[biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions]]
- in [[a case for writing in practice-research]] the split is useful: there are two aspects/jobs - the work of the experience, the work of the researcher. 
- Jokes and descriptions -- [[a case for writing in practice-research#^aae773]]. It's not only about writing. It's about attempting to understand and communicate that we are part of something bigger than ourselves ...

### research and accumulation

- artistic artefacts are part of something bigger than themselves
- sense of time belongs to others
- research is cumulative (if it isn't it can't be called research)

- Noe also discusses the conversation in the arts. How is this not cumulative? (it's just mostly unwritten)
- not forgetting human experience -- Berry -- acknowledging this aspect; see [[human experience and language]]
- Jacobs' thinking re [[mythical vs technological core of culture]] seems to hint cultural phenomena that are not able to be subjected to manipulation 

- unless we take this responsibility (of cumulative research which recognises clearly a community of practice, which is so so different from leaning on theoreticians) we are engaged in the abyss of singular productions of experience. This is fine. But if we attempt to convince ourselves (and heaven forbid others) that this is research then we are engaged in a lie of Journal of Artistic Research proportions.
