# sati, mindfulness and remembering

_previous note:_ [[direct experience through the senses]]

---

The Pali term _sati_ (or _smṛti_ in Sanskrit) was first translated into English as _mindfulness_ in 1881 by English scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids. At the time, the word _mindfulness_ already existed in English, translated from the French _pensee_ in 1530. Earlier terms include _mindful_ (1340), _mindfully_ (1382) and _mindiness_ (1200)

Sati means memory or to remember and this sense of remembering is lost in the translation into _mindfulness_.

The meditation teacher and author Sebene Selassie writes of the importance of remembering in meditation -- of coming back to the body (she calls this _bodyfulness_), or re-membering the body:

>Interestingly, to dismember means to pull the body apart piece by piece ... Maybe we are re–membering. We are getting out of our heads, coming to our senses, cultivating an embodied awareness ... putting our bodies back together breath by breath.[@selassie_getting_nodate n.d.; n.p.]

_thoughts & links:_

- contrast with [[memory and the future]] which is almost entirely the opposite use of remembering "the world"
- contrast idea of dismemberment with parts of Pirsig in [[knifing into parts#^d557bd]]
- [[contemplation beyond rationalization]]
- #finger-pointing-moon -- useful in attempting to describe the experience of authentic movement (as a contemplative practice)? And see in relation to [[Schmalzl - Movement-based embodied contemplative practices]]
