# we try to avoid a downward revision in our perceptions of ourselves

_previous note:_ contrast with [[the infinite game]]

> Research has shown that individuals will do almost anything to avoid a downward revision in their perceptions of themselves. And as both Navratilova and this hypothetical student demonstrate, this includes doing things that are actually quite harmful (deliberately not playing at one's best, or not studying for an exam). However, this also means that they won't perform as well as they could have. Apparently, this outcome is preferable to the one in which the student studies hard, and fails the test.[@roberts-2016-becoming p.27]

The story about Navratilova was when Steffi Graf (and Seles?) were up and coming and Navratilova played badly in order to avoid confronting the possibility that Graf and Seles were better than her. It kept an excuse in her pocket.
