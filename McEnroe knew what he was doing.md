#  McEnroe knew what he was doing

_previous note:_ [[self-consciousness, flow and nonduality]]

Dear

The great tennis player Arthur Ashe kept an audio diary and in February 1974 he described a match against Bjorn Borg: 

> I thought I was playing unconscious, but Borg beat me 6-4, 7-6 tonight, and he is _**in**_ what we call _**the zone**_. (That comes originally from “twilight zone” and translates, more or less, into “another world.”)

As kids growing up on the national tennis circuit in New Zealand, we'd describe this same phenomenon as "playing out of your mind". We knew instinctively – and through bitter experience – that our minds and our thoughts were not always helpful. That there was some kind of tenuous internal battle going on between thought and action. 

The same year that Ashe was talking about Borg being in the zone, W. Timothy Gallwey published a book called _The Inner Game of Tennis_ that was at the vanguard of what is now called psychological skills training. 

My father Ian (a vet) bought _The Inner Game_ around 1979, and he and I set about trying to understand how to play it. He eventually did an undergraduate degree in psychology (in his late 50s) – he was never one to do anything by halves.

Of course _the zone_ and _playing out of your mind_ are ways to describe psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s _flow_, something that goes by many names: in Taoism _wúwéi_ or _action without actor_; in Zen _mushin_ or _no-mind_; in Russian, the word is _perezhivanie_, which means _experiencing_; in the Dzogchen Tibetan Buddhist tradition it is _rigpa_ or pristine awareness; in cognitive science it is called _transient hypofrontality_ which tells you everything you need to know about how scientists name things.

In the early 1980s I was torn between the sense that I was more of a McEnroe-like character: left-handed, curly hair, definitely more emotional on court, and my desire to be Borg. Increasingly _how_ I played – my mannerisms and actions as a tennis player started to mimic McEnroe's and I ended up playing with the same wooden tennis rackets he used before everything went graphite.

Recently I was reading Arne Dietrich's article [Neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the experience of flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810004000583) when I stumbled across this gem:

> The story is told that when [McEnroe] played an opponent who was “in the zone” and could do no wrong with his, say, forehand, McEnroe would call it to his attention by praising his rival on his excellent forehand during the switching of sides. 

And therein lies something exquisite about being beautifully and deeply immersed in a world of action: All it takes is some little tennis-playing so-and-so to use a few innocent words to make you self-conscious and puncture that bubble of immersion.
