Dear

My grandparents used to have a full-sized snooker table. Come to think of it, it was in its own building (or perhaps part of the garage?) across from the house. I don't ever remember them playing snooker or billiards and they seemed perfectly relaxed about having a bunch of kids attempt to play the game. The table was enormous for my pint-sized body and I climbed and crawled all over the table while mostly needing to use a cue rest in the shape of an X. 

I'm mentioning this to you because recently I happened across a [New York Review article by Sally Rooney called Angles of Approach](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2025/03/27/angles-of-approach-unbreakable-ronnie-osullivan). It's a fantastic piece of writing about the famous and enigmatic snooker player Ronnie O'Sullivan. Even if you have zero interest in snooker it's worth a read. 

As Rooney gets further into the writing, she starts to wonder not only what O'Sullivan is thinking about when he is playing, but also what all humans think about when _performing_ actions. 

> When you pick up a ball and throw it, some process undoubtedly takes place in your brain. Maybe that process doesn’t feel to you like thinking. But is there a better name for it? You saw where you wanted the ball to go, and then you moved your arm to make it go there. Who knows how many millions of nerve endings were sending you information about the ball, about the target; who knows how many muscles in your shoulder, arm, and hand were activated when you made the throw. Like remembering a song and then singing it. You don’t need to make any mental calculations about the resonance frequencies of your vocal cords. The song comes into your head, and you can sing it, or maybe you can’t.

If you have been reading this newsletter a while you will know that I used to play tennis at a high level. It was most certainly at the level of not having to think about how to play or how to hit the ball. It was the kind of level when all of that training just, well, comes out of you. As some evidence, [here I am as a 12 year old thwacking the living daylights out the ball](https://www.skellis.net/blog/tennis/). Note the Anarchy graffiti seconded into a target? But, I'm definitely thinking in that video. I can see myself thinking and feeling in training while trying to modify the follow-through on my forehand. 

The thing is though, I also remember how my coach used to say, "You think too much Simon". It was -- and remains -- a strange criticism (as an aside, I also remember being dropped by a girlfriend who accused me of making _her_ think too much -- that stung). How can one think too much? Or perhaps the question is, when is the time to think and when is it not the time to think? 

Rooney continues: 

> In the course of writing this essay, I asked quite a few people to try and describe what goes on inside their minds when carrying out perceptual-motor tasks like catching or throwing. And some told me that the answer was: nothing important. When presented with a given physical task, anyone can see, just by looking, what they would _like_ to accomplish—where they want the ball to go, what kind of shot they want to make. In response to a given task, our minds will give us all the same instructions: athletes can just obey those instructions more quickly, efficiently, and precisely than the rest of us.

It's obvious now -- 44 years later -- that I was indeed thinking unnecessarily while playing tennis; that my thinking was getting in the way of hitting the ball. I wish, as a 12 year-old, I'd asked my coach, "_How_ do I stop thinking?"

Dancing is not so different in this respect from playing tennis. We practice to get better at dancing -- at performing various movements, some simple, some complex, some very complex -- and gradually we no longer need to think about what to do. It's so obvious it's hardly worth mentioning. This is what being an expert is: someone who no longer needs to think about what to do and when to do it. 

Yet I also know -- now as an expert improviser in dance -- that I am thinking while dancing. It's not a lot though, and only fleetingly. But somehow it feels like calling it thinking does not do the experience justice. Perhaps it is more like sensing-noticing-adjusting-tuning that is barely conscious? (I don't imagine that phrasing catching on). When I am deep in the flow of the dance, it definitely doesn't feel like thinking. It feels more like I am observing someone else (without seeing that person) that I know to be me and the fact that it is me is emphatically inconsequential. It is the opposite of self-consciousness. 

Here is the philosopher Jay L. Garfield from his excellent book _Losing Ourselves_: 

> [E]xpert consciousness is nondual. The expert is not conscious of his or her own subjectivity and its relation to the object with which he or she is engaged, or even of the tools the expert might be using, including his or her own body. That is the kind of novice awareness that just gets in the way. Instead, the focused attention of the expert is entirely on the task at hand and on the goals to be accomplished through that task. It is immersed, embodied awareness, and awareness that is entirely fluid, adjusting to the ever-changing demands of the task at hand. Nothing resembling a self is ever present in this kind of consciousness. 

What is most curious in these two experiences -- one as a teenager tennis playing wannabe, the other as a professional dancer -- is that the kind of consciousness Garfield is describing feels as solid and secure now while dancing as it felt fragile and fleeting while playing tennis as a teenager. The difference is that now while dancing I seem to be able to integrate and accept thoughts (including thoughts-as-doubts) as part of the field of consciousness rather than things (or objects) that produce a self-conscious _me_ separate from embodied awareness.
