# artists and scientists intervene in the world

_previous note:_ 

---

comparison of scientific creation of phenomena (through experiments) with artistic practice as experimentation

>Scientific experiments make “visible” certain features of the world, and they keep them separated against the background of all other factors that concur in bringing about natural events. Artistic experiments—not only interventions but representations as well—produce knowledge by creating phenomena that highlight, underscore, display, or convey in their traits certain features of the world, and in doing so they make these features salient, allowing people to see what cannot easily be seen in everyday life. An artwork, as Catherine Z. Elgin states, “affords epistemic access to the features it exemplifies \[...\]. It presents those features in a context contrived to render them salient. This may involve unravelling common concomitants, filtering out impurities, clearing away unwanted clutter, presenting in unusual settings.”8[p.79]

- look up Catherine Z. Elgin, “Understanding: Art and Science,” Synthese, no. 95 (1993): 17. from this article

>Both artists and scientists intervene in the world and intervention is a process in which an underlying causal reality is used to do, make, or change things.[@garbolino_what_2013 p.76]

>In this recent view, science is driven by practice and is largely skill-based, network-based, and laboratory-based, and experimental practice embodies a knowing-how that cannot be entirely captured by the notion that knowledge is propositional knowledge.[p.77]

- this is the 'practical turn' in philosophy of science


>scientific knowledge is the product of stable patterns of scientific practice that emerge from complex networks of skills, competences, instruments, and intellectual and material resources, in which “the manipulative hand and the attentive eye,”6 to use Ian Hacking’s words, play a role.[p.78]
