# pro-filmic events occur in real time at the moment of filming

>Dancefilm is understood as a modality that appears across various types of films including the musical, music video and experimental shorts and is characterized by a ‘filmic performance’ dominated by choreographic strategies or effects. Filmic performance is a comprehensive term incorporating all aspects of cinematic production, so that the choreographic quality of the dancefilm can be considered in relation to both the pro-filmic and filmic elements. For, if the ‘pro-filmic’ refers to the events as they occur in real time at the moment of filming and ‘filmic’ to the elements of the final screen version, both are equally important when dealing with the parameters of dance and film in dancefilm.[@brannigan-2009-microchoreographies p.121]
