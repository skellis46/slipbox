# pro-filmic events occur in real time at the moment of filming

_previous note:_ [[body of the film]]

>Dancefilm is understood as a modality that appears across various types of films including the musical, music video and experimental shorts and is characterized by a ‘filmic performance’ dominated by choreographic strategies or effects. Filmic performance is a comprehensive term incorporating all aspects of cinematic production, so that the choreographic quality of the dancefilm can be considered in relation to both the pro-filmic and filmic elements. For, if the ‘pro-filmic’ refers to the events as they occur in real time at the moment of filming and ‘filmic’ to the elements of the final screen version, both are equally important when dealing with the parameters of dance and film in dancefilm.[@brannigan-2009-microchoreographies p.121]

- from edit bin for [[Lithium dancing]]:

In _Between Faces_,[-@ellis-2018-faces] dance artist Simon Ellis describes how we in screendance ought to take the hyper-presence of smartphones very seriously. He describes how smartphone cameras and screens create a dizzyingly reflexive situation in which we have: "a moving body on screen, a moving body having operated the camera (which is often simply a smartphone screen), and a moving body holding a screen/smart-phone as the video is played back and watched."[@ellis-2018-faces n.pag]

But Ellis leaves out something crucial. He leaves out the part that screendance scholar Erin Brannigan calls pro-filmic events. These "occur in real time at the moment of filming"[@brannigan-2009-microchoreographies p.121] and are distinct from filmic elements inherent to the final screen version. 

But what if anything is pro-filmic about these two people I saw dancing for their smartphone that afternoon?  In theory, yes. But in practice, no. In practice I think they are more deeply involved in simply being friends. The 'filmic' aspect of their behaviour is not something I am privy to, and it is an open question as to how present it is for them.
