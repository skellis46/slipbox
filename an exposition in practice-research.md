# an exposition in practice-research

_previous note:_ [[art practices explicitly become epistemic things]]

Personal communication from Schwab:

>We really decided on this term when we proposed the RC and SAR. I used it in a ‘call for support’ from 2009 which was sent around to various stakeholders. Following this, it’s probably the editorial for JAR0 - I don’t think that the concept was used before in any specific way. Henk Borgdorff has also credited me with this: [https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-work?work=388034](https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-work?work=388034) p.x[^1]

- be great to get the whole book below (on Expositions) - digging around trying to find the route of the term exposition.

OK, here's Schwab referencing himself re expositions:


>Using the concept of _expositionality_ or _exposing practice as research_ (Schwab 2011, 2012b; Schwab and Borgdorff 2014), JAR subjects both the form and the content of research articulations to a rigorous peer-review process (Schwab 2018a). However, to understand the epistemological implications of expositionality, I have also been investigating how Hans-Jörg Rheinberger’s theory of experimental systems (1997) may be methodologically deployed, how it may help characterise what is happening in artistic research, and how, conversely, such a theory would have to be critiqued from the point of view of artistic research practice (Schwab 2014b) #toread.
