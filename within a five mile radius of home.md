# within a five mile radius of home

_previous note:_ [[genuine emergency and cultural output]]

> There is too much information, we can’t hold it all in our minds, and there’s a problematic idea that we feel we need to know everything to be environmentally active. But it is impossible and it paralyses people. What is more interesting to me is to ask: what is happening within a five mile radius of my home, what are the invasive species that live here? What is the Indigenous history, can I go out and walk every single day? Can I find a sit spot? Can I begin to gather a council, a world of witnesses that constitute me relationally?

- [[footfall]] - within a five mile radius. How much might I know about that space in Sottochiesa?
