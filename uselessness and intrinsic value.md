# uselessness and intrinsic value

_previous note:_ [[instrumental extrinsic value definition]]

In their popular article [How to be useless](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-wander-free-and-easy-through-life-by-being-useless) Helen De Cruz & Pauline Lee discuss Daoist understanding of utility. They write that to be useless is a means to free ourselves from a "calculus in which we end up seeing ourselves and people around us as a means to an end."[@decruz-2022-how n.pag.] 

They describe the value of being intrinsically good, that hints at conditions of acceptance and non-judgment.
