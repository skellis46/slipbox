# having said that Nick Cave

_previous note:_ [[negative capability]]

Nick Caves talks about how 'having said that' are three of his favourite words (as well as _On the other hand_ and _However_):

> I like all of these phrases because they acknowledge one point of view but also tender another, they preface the presentation of a stabilising counterargument. This is something not much liked in our contemporary culture, it is unpopular on social media that trades primarily in a currency of performative moral outrage. ‘Having said that’ is the bothersome and deflating enemy of polarisation, self-righteousness, intolerance and hubris.

>'Having said that’ is the precondition of empathy, it is the capacity to see and understand the other side, to show that we have the necessary willingness to hold two contrasting ideas in our hand at the same time.

- [[thinking is social]]
- [[information is the reduction of uncertainty]]

Compare this with L. M. Sacasas who writes:

> By contrast, the phenomenology of the switch (or even of the digital binary itself … too speculative perhaps) teaches us both that things will answer to our demands instantaneously and that all things must be either one thing or the other and that there is no relation between the two. It is this or it is that. The one does not participate in the other, they do not gradually yield from one to the other with an intermingling and participation of being such as we see in the dawn or evening sky.
