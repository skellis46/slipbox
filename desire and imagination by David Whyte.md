# desire and imagination by David Whyte

_previous note:_ [[technopoly trains our desires]]

from: <https://grahamduncan.blog/whats-going-on-here/>

> The poet David Whyte describes the unfolding of life and career as a “conversation with reality”:

> *Whatever a human being desires for themselves will not come about exactly as they first imagined it or first laid it out in their minds…what always happens is the meeting between what you desire from your world and what the world desires of you. It’s this frontier where you overhear yourself and you overhear the world.* 
> *And that frontier is the only place where things are real…in which you just try to keep an integrity and groundedness while keeping your eyes and your voice dedicated toward the horizon that you’re going to, or the horizon in another person you’re meeting.*"
