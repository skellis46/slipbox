# brittle with relics

_previous note:_ [[the land in you]]

I recently shared my film [Children of the Soil](https://www.skellis.net/children-of-the-soil) with a friend who wrote back that "your film took me very directly to this:"

> To live in Wales is to be conscious  
> At dusk of the spilled blood  
> That went into the making of the wild sky,  
> Dyeing the immaculate rivers  
> In all their courses.  
> It is to be aware,  
> Above the noisy tractor  
> And hum of the machine  
> Of strife in the strung woods,  
> Vibrant with sped arrows.  
> You cannot live in the present,  
> At least not in Wales.  
> There is the language for instance,  
> The soft consonants  
> Strange to the ear.  
> There are cries in the dark at night  
> As owls answer the moon,  
> And thick ambush of shadows,  
> Hushed at the fields' corners.  
> There is no present in Wales,  
> And no future;  
> There is only the past,  
> Brittle with relics,  
> Wind-bitten towers and castles  
> With sham ghosts;  
> Mouldering quarries and mines;  
> And an impotent people,  
> Sick with inbreeding,  
> Worrying the carcase of an old song.

_Welsh Landscape_ by R.S. Thomas.

One of the things I like about art is how it sends us to other things. It triggers our imaginations. It reminds us. Of course I don't think this is the sole preserve of art (think of [Proust's madeleine](https://www.the-philosophy.com/proust-madeleine)) but perhaps one of art's roles is to directly invite the possibility of connecting with our pasts, presents and possible futures (through the imagination).
