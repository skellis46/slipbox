# observer and observed travel in the same direction

_previous note:_ [[knowing is immanent in the field of practice]]

>I am not -- as Sperber would have it (1996: 32) -- the 'user' of a form that you have yourself 'produced', but have rather joined with you, albeit silently, in the process of its production. The same goes for watching the activity of the cook in the kitchen: again, the movement of my attention 'follows' that of the cook as he goes about his task. To listen or to watch, in that sense, is to accompany another being, to follow - even if only for a short while - the same path as that being through the lifeworld, and to share in the experience the journey affords. Critically, in this journey, both observer and observed travel in the same direction. Listening, in short, is not the reverse of whistling or speaking, nor is watching the reverse of doing, for 'both are oriented in the same direction by the movement of consciousness' (Ingold 1986: 273).[@ingold_transmission_2001 p.144]

- thinking about role of observer in authentic movement, but also role of third-person in #finger-pointing-moon
