# the ordinary self appears as content within the space of nonduality

_previous note:_ [[Zoran﻿ ﻿Josipovic﻿ - Nondual Awareness and Minimal Phenomenal Experience]]

> To the ordinary self, NDA appears as an object of sorts, something one might want to experience or as a capacity one might want to have. To NDA, however, the ordinary self and its constituting processes, to the extent that they can be phenomenally accessed, appear as contents within its space. [@josipovic-2020-nondual p.5]

- [[losing oneself]]
- this matches so strongly my experience practising [[authentic movement]] -- it reduces the sense of this ordinary self
