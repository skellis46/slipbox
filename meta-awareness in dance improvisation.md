# meta-awareness in dance improvisation

- article making sense of my experience of doing [[authentic movement]] (or my version of it)

> Different meditations require different attentional styles. Attention can be analogous to a focal point with each focal point providing a unique perspective. Given that all meditative techniques modulate the insula, each meditation can provide a unique perspective from which to investigate complex interoceptive signals that may be unavailable from other meditative traditions. It may prove more useful to anchor scientific findings in the concrete body as a means to investigate those rather than a set of abstract, broadly defined meditative techniques.[@gibson-2019-mindfulness p.1]

- this thing about attentional styles is useful re dance improvisation
- marginalian's [[the unphotographable]]: [https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/unphotographable/](https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/unphotographable/) - re [[authentic movement]] and consciousness? Seems to link with that strong sense of something not being able to be described -- being beyond words (talked of in conversations about embodiment?)
