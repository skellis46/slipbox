# the subjective properties of conscious experience

_previous note:_ [[qualia - the knowledge argument and mary's room]]

> This way of putting things is most closely associated with the philosopher Thomas Nagel, who in 1974 published a now legendary article called ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ in which he argued that while we humans could never experience the experiences of a bat, there nonetheless would be something it is like for the bat, to be a bat.* I’ve always favoured Nagel’s approach because it emphasises phenomenology: the subjective properties of conscious experience, such as why a visual experience has the form, structure, and qualities that it does, as compared to the subjective properties of an emotional experience, or of an olfactory experience. These properties are sometimes also called qualia in philosophy: 12the redness of red, the pang of jealousy, the sharp pain or dull throb of a toothache. [@seth-2021-being Location 191]

> Wherever there is experience, there is phenomenology; and wherever there is phenomenology, there is consciousness. [@seth-2021-being Location 199]

> The definition of consciousness as ‘any kind of subjective experience whatsoever’ is admittedly simple and may even sound trivial, but this is a good thing. When a complex phenomenon is incompletely understood, prematurely precise definitions can be constraining and even misleading. [@seth-2021-being Location 228]

I like this simple idea of phenomenology as "the subjective properties of conscious experience".
