# types of understanding

_previous note:_ 

Philosopher Emma C. Gordon's overview of the "epistemic state or states of understanding"[@gordon-nodate-understanding] is comprehensive.  

She describes three types of understanding:

1. propositional understanding: I know that X
2. understanding why: I understand why X
3. objectual understanding: I understand X, "where X is a body of information or subject matter"[@gordon-nodate-understanding]

>Objectual understanding is equivalent to what Pritchard has at some points termed ‘holistic understanding’ (2009: 12).[@gordon-nodate-understanding n.pag.]

Worth noting that Gordon suggests that:

>There is debate about both (i) whether understanding-why might fairly be called _explanatory_ understanding and (ii) how understanding-why might differ from propositional knowledge.[@gordon-nodate-understanding n.pag.]

Concerning objectual understanding Gordon also discusses the perceived epistemic value of understanding:

>... a very weak view of understanding’s factivity does not fit with the plausible and often expressed intuition that understanding is something especially epistemically _valuable_. For example, Kvanvig (2003: 206) observes that “we have an ordinary conception that understanding is a milestone to be achieved by long and sustained efforts at knowledge acquisition” and Whitcomb (2012: 8) reflects that “understanding is widely taken to be a “higher” epistemic good: a state that is like knowledge and true belief, but even better, epistemically speaking.”[@gordon-nodate-understanding n.pag.]

_thoughts & links:_

- see for example Noë's analysis of understanding why a joke is funny in [[a case for writing in practice-research]] and also in [[art as source of knowledge]], and in [[conversation and understanding]]
- the critical question for me is to be clear how understanding is different know from knowledge
- compare with [[gadamer and understanding as an event]] and how it seems to differ inconsequentially from objectual understanding
- worth noting how common it is (or at least it seems to be) in practice-research for the words _knowledge_ and _understanding_ to be lumped together. See [[borgdorff - debate on research in the arts#^e4ce42]]
- see Scrivener in [[scrivener - transformational practice]] and development of understanding through art
