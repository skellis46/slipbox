# off-line cognition

> Any cognitive activity that takes place “off-line,” in the absence of task-relevant input and output, is by definition not situated. Examples include planning, remembering, and day-dreaming, in contexts not directly relevant to the content of plans, memories, or day-dreams.

-- Margaret Wilson [-@wilson-2002-six p.626]

This is in contrast with situated or "on-line" cognition:

> By definition, situated cognition involves interaction with the things that the cognitive activity is about. Yet one of the hallmarks of human cognition is that it can take place decoupled from any immediate interaction with the environment. We can lay plans for the future, and think over what has happened in the past. We can entertain counterfactuals to consider what might have happened if circumstances had been different. We can construct mental representations of situations we have never experienced, based purely on linguistic input from others. In short, our ability to form mental representations about things that are remote in time and space, which is arguably the sine qua non of human thought, in principle cannot yield to a situated cognition analysis. [@wilson-2002-six p.626]

And yet Adrian Harris provides an example of off-line cognition that is situated: 

> On-line cognition is concerned with "immediate input" from our local environment (Iverson & Thelan, 2000: 37), and deals with "here-and-now" tasks (Bassili, 1989: xiv) that require fast moment-by-moment processing. We switch to slower, off-line cognition to make more careful considerations, like when we make a mental check on something odd or plan future behaviour (Corr, 2006: 468). Everyday activity and conversations use predominantly on-line cognition, as does reading, but when the usual flow is interrupted we switch to off-line processing.[@harris-2015-online n.pag]

Harris uses this sentence as an example: "The old man the boats". Starts on-line but shifts to off-line to make sense. In this case though the off-line is still situated as it requires immediate input from local environment.
