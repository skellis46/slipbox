# people are made of stories

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]

> People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments. Which is why, even when we’ve experienced the same events as other individuals, we never constructed identical narratives: the criteria used for selecting moments were different for each of us, and a reflection of our personalities. Each of us noticed the details that caught our attention and remembered what was important to us, and the narratives we built shaped our personalities in turn. But, I wondered, if everyone remembered everything, would our differences get shaved away? What would happen to our sense of self? It seemed to me that a perfect memory couldn’t be a narrative any more than unedited security-cam footage could be a feature film.

- Ted Chiang, _The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling_ (in Exhalation, 2019)

This short story is really the beginning of my interest in this project -- but it is also a continuation of all that early work on memory.
