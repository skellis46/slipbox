# the dextrous butcher

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

> *The Dexterous Butcher* is a famous proverb by Zhuangzi that describes a cook cutting up an ox (de Bary & Bloom, 1968). A beginner would “hack” away at the meat, but the butcher knows the way of non-doing, and can effortlessly glide the knife through the meat while avoiding all the joints and ligaments. Like flow, there is a balance of challenge and skills, a merging of action and awareness, and the focus is no longer on the self. In such an absorbed state, the self is not merely ignored, but rather *transforms* as the person becomes integrated into the activity. The subject (the butcher) and the object (cutting the ox) have merged into a single dynamic unit. This experience, commonly described as becoming One with the object, is a feature of nonduality.
