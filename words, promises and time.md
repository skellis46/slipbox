# words, promises and time

_previous note:_ [[future responsibility and stewardship]]

---

As I listened from a beach-chair in the shade
To all the noises that my garden made,
It seemed to me only proper that words
Should be withheld from vegetables and birds.

A robin with no Christian name ran through
The Robin-Anthem which was all it knew,
And rustling flowers for some third party waited
To say which pairs, if any, should get mated.

Not one of them was capable of lying,
There was not one which knew that it was dying
Or could have with a rhythm or a rhyme
Assumed responsibility for time.

Let them leave language to their lonely betters
Who count some days and long for certain letters;
We, too, make noises when we laugh or weep:
Words are for those with promises to keep.

-- W.H. Auden, _Their Lonely Betters_(1950)


_questions & thoughts:_

- this idea of assuming responsibility for time is staggeringly beautiful (and how it is perhaps humankind's greatest responsibility and the one we are avoiding terribly)
- has me thinking about self-consciousness and self-awareness, and what we do with these _gifts_

--- 

_consider:_

- [[search for truth]]
- [[direct experience through the senses]]
- [[human experience and language]]
- [[without symbolic mediation]]
- [[to define the meaning of we]]
- [[humans blush]]
