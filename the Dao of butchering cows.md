# the Dao of butchering cows

Yuk Hui is a philosopher. In his article [[Cosmotechnics as Cosmopolitics]] he briefly discusses [[noumenon and phenomenon]], and states that Dao "belongs to the noumenon according to the Kantian distinction, while Qi belongs to the phenomenon.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

He tells the story of a very good butcher called Pao Ding (as told in _Zhuangzi_). Pao Ding claims that having an excellent knife is not enough:

>it is more important to understand the Dao in the cow, so that one does not use the blade to cut through the bones and tendons, but rather to pass alongside them in order to enter into the gaps between them.[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]

Hui writes that when the butcher encounters any difficulty, "he slows down the knife and gropes for the right place to move further."[@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.] This is the Dao (or _way_ or _path_), whereas the Qi is the technical/phenomenal object (or "technics"): the knife.

_thoughts & links:_

- Towards the end, Hui says something rather inscrutable: "But it is possible to infinitize Qi so as to infinitize the self and enter into the noumenon—this is the question of art." I don't quite know what it would mean to infinitize the self, but he seems to be getting at the possibility of art entering the neumonal; the unknowable "thing-in-itself".
- the [[device paradigm and focal things]] seems to link to Hui's description of Dao. That we must not let the Qi stand in for _the path_: "one cannot seek the perfection of technics through the perfection of a tool or a skill, since perfection can only be accomplished by Dao." See [[technics. techne, and technology#^2ef6ed]] for clarity re the term technics
