# 20230526 - china - the many practices of practice research

1. Title: The many practices of practice research 

2. Abstract

In this presentation I seek to address the differences between art made outside of the academy, and art made as part of PhD research within the academy. In doing so I will make a case for the cultural and epistemic value of practice research, as well as its limitations. I will draw on the scholarship of Alva Noë, Michael Biggs and Daniela Büchler, as well as my own current research into dance epistemology. My approach will be to use a 'steel man' (as opposed to a 'straw man') argument to discuss the positions against practice research so that we might understand the complex nature of practices within practice research, and to present an expanded perspective on the nature of postgraduate research in higher education.

4. Biography (110 words)

Simon Ellis works with practices of choreography, filmmaking and dance. He was born in the Wairarapa in Aotearoa New Zealand, but now lives in the UK and works at the Centre for Dance Research, Coventry University. He grew up in a family where conversations about human dignity, consumerism and even technology were common. These conversations have shaped his values as an artist, and underpin much of what his practice is about, and how it is conducted. Simon was awarded the first ever practice research PhD at the University of Melbourne (2005) and his expertise is on non dual awareness in dance improvisation and the epistemic possibilities of practice research. www.skellis.net

# The many practices of practice research

## Introduction: a life-changing moment

It is late 1999 and I am standing in a night club in Melbourne watching a contemporary dance performance. A former university teacher of mine leans over to me and says, "Simon, the University of Melbourne is now allowing PhD students to submit artistic work as part of PhDs". That moment changed my life and it is why I am here with you now.

Good evening everyone and thank you for this tremendous honour to present to you and talk with you today. I bring you greetings, respect and kindness here from the Centre for Dance Research at the University of Coventry in England. 

My expertise is in dance and choreography, but also in the various research methods now collectively known as practice research. Practice research goes by other names: artistic research, practice-led research, practice as research, practice-based research. But they are more or less the same thing, and for the purposes of this conversation their differences and different histories are not important. 

There are good things and bad things about practice research. Like any research method or approach it is has limitations and possibilities, positive aspects and negative aspects. It is also -- again like all research methods -- partial; partial in the claims that can be made based on its use; partial in how it helps us understand different phenomena. 

This evening I want to argue for the value of practice research, but I want to argue in good faith. By that I mean I want to address very directly what practice research affords or makes possible, and where it fails. To make these good faith arguments I am going to adopt an expansive view on the nature of research in higher education to help communicate some of the epistemic possibilities of practice research. 

I am also aware that my talk is the third of three presentations you have attended about practice research. Therefore, some of these ideas might be becoming more familiar to you. Perhaps with these three different perspectives -- from my colleagues Vida Midgelow on the 12th of May and Rosemary Kate Martin on the 19th May, and me here today -- your understanding of practice research will be developing and clarifying. Or perhaps you will see another side of practice research, as if holding a crystal -- an object with many surfaces that looks different depending on which surface you observe. 

I am going to talk for about 40 minutes. I am sure that's more than enough to get into the heart of these ideas, but also it will leave time for questions and conversations at the end.

## Constructing the methods of an unknown research process

I will begin at my beginning in practice research. It was before I had even heard of what was then called practice-led research or practice-based research. 

In 1999 the University of Melbourne in Australia changed its submission policy for PhDs so that creative work could contribute up to 50% of an entire PhD submission. I was 31 years old at the time. 

Up until then artists working in the academy -- or academics interested in the nature of arts practices -- tended to append their work onto other disciplines: psychology, sociology, education. PhDs in these circumstances made 'arts practice' the object of the research, and applied discipline-specific methods to analyse and understand those phenomena. I'll return to this idea of the object of research -- a question of ontology -- later in this presentation. 

And so there I was in late 1999, working as a freelance dancer and choreographer with a Master's degree in physics (specifically biomechanics and newtonian mechanics), and the University of Melbourne appeared to be gifting me an opportunity: I could develop PhD research that included my artistic practice and that practice could comprise up to 50% of the PhD including how it was presented -- its outputs.

In March 2000 I started my practice research PhD; I was the first such student at the University of Melbourne. Being first in any institutional process is both a blessing and a curse. There were, more or less, no rules to follow and help guide me and ... well ... there were no rules to follow! I was free to do something but no one really knew what, perhaps other than making an art work. My supervisors and the academic team did not really know how the artistic research process was meant to happen except that we understood that I needed to find a path. The University's PhD regulations had existed for a long time and were built on a particular world of epistemic assumptions that had language like: research protocols, subjects (i.e. participants), data collection, and data analysis.

That was my PhD world for those few years -- coming to grips with an unknown research process as I was constructing the methods around me. It was discombobulating yet it laid the foundations for me to think deeply about what it means to come to know through artistic practice, how we come to know and perhaps even what we might come to know. I remember a Professor of mine in the very early 1990s in New Zealand -- his name was Professor L.R.T. Williams -- used to ask us that most elegant of epistemic questions: "_How_ do we know _that_ we know _what_ we know?"

## Invisible metaphors

I mentioned briefly just a moment ago how before the advent of practice research people interested in researching the arts worked quietly in education, psychology and sociology departments ... and sometimes even in science laboratories. The Dutch scholar Henk Borgdorff calls such research **research on the arts**, which is when the art practice is the _object_ of the research, and that the object is "untouched" by the researcher [@borgdorff-2006-debate p.6].

Borgdorff's idea reveals an important epistemic assumption that mostly we take for granted when we do research in the university: that there is an object out there, able to be seen and able to be manipulated by we human subjects. It is no coincidence that in the English language we speak of research _findings_. But 'findings' is a metaphor designed to concretise research processes and outcomes: that there is something out there to be found. Indeed, it's a very Western idea built during the period of time now known as the European enlightenment. Think too of the metaphorical implications of that word: enlightenment. To enlighten. We shine lights on objects 'out there' -- we illuminate them so that human-kind might become enlightened. These are big metaphors; God-like even: lightness and darkness ... not so far from good and evil! These metaphors shape the methods we use and the technologies we develop to use those methods. Our methods and metaphors have become the air we breathe in universities. The technologies are the knives we wield to dissect the objects of our curiousity, our attention. Yet, what is most powerful about metaphors is that we forget where they came from and what messages they convey about how we see the world. They become invisible. 

## The butcher's dance

I am going to recount a story that you probably know very well. It is the story of the very good butcher Pao Ding as told in the Zhuangzi (莊子) in the 4th century BC. Please forgive my hubris for bringing a story that has emerged from Chinese culture back to you in China! I am not sure about the wisdom of such hubris, and I sincerely hope I am not committing a cultural faux pas. But I want to remind you of this story because I think contained in it is the essence of why practice research matters in higher education and advanced research. 

The story is translated from Chinese into English by Burton Watson, and then back to you into Mandarin by xx. What a strange sequence of events that is!

Here it is.

> Cook Ding was cutting up an ox for Lord Wenhui. At every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder, every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee — zip! zoop! He slithered the knife along with a zing, and all was in perfect rhythm, as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove or keeping time to the Jingshou music.

> “Ah, this is marvelous!” said Lord Wenhui. “Imagine skill reaching such heights!”

> Cook Ding laid down his knife and replied, “What I care about is the Way (the Dao), which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now — now I go at it by spirit and don’t look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and following things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.

> “A good cook changes his knife once a year — because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month — because he hacks. I’ve had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I’ve cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there’s plenty of room — more than enough for the blade to play about it. That’s why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone.

> “However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I’m doing, work very slowly, and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until — flop! the whole thing comes apart like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground. I stand there holding the knife and look all around me, completely satisfied and reluctant to move on, and then I wipe off the knife and put it away.”

> “Excellent!” said Lord Wenhui. “I have heard the words of Cook Ding and learned how to care for life!” [@able-2020-dexterous n.pag.]

There are, as you know better than I, many ways to interpret this story: as dialectical method of self-cultivation; as aesthetic mode of being in the world; as method of cultivation that realizes the unity of subject and object; as a transformation of the self from a ‘human mechanism’ to a ‘natural mechanism’; and, of course, as caring for life (yangsheng 養生) [@turner-2023-yangsheng].

There is also the distinction between the Dao and Qi in the story. There is the knife as Qi: the technical object wielded to carve the ox-as-object. And there is the Dao (or 'the way' as it is translated into English) as expressed or performed by the Butcher [@hui-2017-cosmotechnics n.pag.]. Perhaps in Western psychology Master Zhuang's story most closely aligns with Csíkszentmihályi's concept of flow: 

> the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time. (wikipedia)

The human experience of flow is common. If you have played sport to a high level you will have had experiences of flow. If you have designed software you will have had experiences of flow. Almost any human endeavour which requires skill and attention affords the possibility of experiencing flow states. 

But what of the very good butcher Pao Ding? We could do scientific research into his work. We might focus on the physics of his actions, the physical structure of the ox, the forces that hold the ox together and the forces required to overcome the ox's anatomy. We might learn about torque, pressure, potential energy and kinetic energy specific to that system. These might all be useful things to understand. They might help us prevent butchers from overwork, or how to improve the quality of knives or the environments that butchers work in. All useful things. 

Here's the philosopher Keith Frankish:

> Physics doesn't say what an electron, or any other basic particle, is like in itself, _intrinsically_. And, arguably, it never could, since its conceptual resources -- mathematical concepts, together with the concepts of causation and spatiotemporal position -- are suitable only for describing structures and processes, not intrinsic qualities [@frankish-2016-why n.pag].

Physics would tell us nothing about the experience of the butcher as he came to understand the Dao through practice.

Perhaps a psychological study would be more useful? In this case the butcher's psychology -- his emotions, motivations, perceptions or even the state of flow -- would become the object of the scientific investigation. But such a psychological account would tell us little about the phenomenal experience of the butcher as he came to understand the Dao through practice. 

What then of the butcher's experience as experienced by the butcher? The first-person experience. The "I". The subjective. What if the butcher were a researcher as well, with his emergent experience through practice the object of that research? Are there things to be understood differently about human endeavour and human experience from the work he does (or makes)?   

Here is the heart of practice research. Practice research enables artist-researchers to develop understanding through practice and then to seek ways to share and communicate that understanding. 

## The bifurcated product

I hope that is clear. I hope it is clear because while I think the fundamental principles of practice research are more or less equivalent to other research fields, there is one difference. It is a difference that has been with us since the early years of practice research in the UK. 

Here's Angela Piccini writing online in the northern autumn of 2002:

> Must [practice research] include some form of disseminable reflection? or is the practice in performance sufficient to stand as research output? [Piccini in @thomson-2003-practice p.161]

The disseminable reflection that Piccini refers to is called "complementary writing" [-@nelson-2013-practice p.11] by Robin Nelson, and is described as a "research narrative" [@bulley-2021-report p.27] in the Practice Research Action Group's _Practice Research Report_ here in England. Although the written component of practice research started out as a means to to distinguish 'art' from 'artistic research' [@magee-2012-introduction], it is now hegemonic in providing something akin to what Michael Biggs and Daniela Büchler call "a single unified answer" [-@biggs-2011-communities p.91]. 

- note here about messiness -- unfinished thinking. vital epistemic component.

in contrast to the "plurality of experiences"[@biggs-2011-communities p.91] and "unfinished thinking"[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.194] of the "provisional"[@schwab-2019-experimental p.166] practice artifact or outcome. The contrasting language of "unified answer" and "unfinished thinking" reflects the divergent epistemic affordances of art practices and writing-about art practices.[@ellis-2018-that] Nevertheless, the research narrative is as consistent and concrete a component of practice research as one can imagine, even if its form-content is wildly variable. 

the bifurcation

I need to talk about the words that are written as part of practice research. These words are another less obvious part of the split between the academic forum and the forum of the arts. Borgdorff writes plainly that "a discursive justification of the research will be necessary with the academic discourse in mind" [@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.167]. Such discursive justification is what artist-scholar Paul Magee calls the "bifurcated product":[@magee-2012-introduction p.3] the artwork and the writing about the artwork. 

In _The Conflict of the Faculties_ (2012) Henk Borgdorff states that "[practice] research addresses itself both to the academic forum and to the forum of the arts",[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.167] and that it is "directed first of all to the art world."[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.167] 

The responsibility to these two forums or audiences that Borgdorff describes is complex, although how an artist presents their work to the artistic community has a longer history and is likely more familiar. Our artist selves understand the expectations, economies, currencies, processes, codes and needs of the artistic world to which we belong. The artwork will exist somewhere along various continuums: seen or not seen; sold or not sold; reviewed kindly or not reviewed at all; it will be fashionable or not fashionable; liked or not liked; talked about or not talked about; remembered or forgotten. How the work was made -- including even the nature of its underlying practices -- is mostly if not completely irrelevant, and how the work functions epistemically might be _felt_ as its potential _understandings_ circulate in the aether, but it is never discussed directly. 

## Principles and limitations of practice research

### 1. The principle of mess

ad hoc vs rigour (ad hoc in science)

In _The Mangle of Practice_ (1995)[^alys] the sociologist and historian of science Andrew Pickering describes the practice and culture of science as "performative"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.7]; an unpredictable "dance of agency"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.21] in which the mangle of scientific practice represents a "dialectic of resistance and accommodation".[@pickering-1995-mangle pp.22-23]. 

Pickering's analysis is important in science as it draws together divergent understandings of objectivity; between Pickering's "emergent and posthumanist"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.198] mangle of practice, and more traditional "humanist rules of mental hygiene"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.198] in which scientists avoid ad hoc modifications and create only falsifiable theories. But in artistic practices is not the mangle of practice a given? 

### 2. The principle of many practices

children of the soil? -- the many practices

### 3. The principle of strange tools

Alva Noë, 

### 4. The principle of two (interweaving) formats

tension between artistic outputs (unfinished thinking: open) and discourses re that 'unfinished-ness' (seemingly more tangible?)

### 4. The principle of truth and limited claims

-- like epistemic humility (Ingold: "There is danger in conflating truth and objectivity. It is the search for truth that underpins research. Search and search again. Research is continually conducted in the dark.") [@ingold-2018-search n.pag.] What if any claims (or new insights) can be made and on what basis? 

> An academic claim--a claim you make in an argument--is considered debatable or up for inquiry.

Nordquist, readwise 

-- but where and when are the debates happening? this is a serious problem in practice research. One I have writen about in (forthcoming)

### 5. The principle of futurity

(or emergence?): many possible futures (<https://practiceasresearchblog.wordpress.com/2021/04/16/many-possible-futures/>) [@ellis-2021-many] and Wilson and van Ruiten: "“orientation to the future” in which “the as yet un-thought may become thought; and that new modes and styles of sense, perception, expression and subject construction might yet emerge and re-shape our worlds."[@wilson-2013-share p.265]

### 6. The principle of availability
responsibility to making our work available to others (trumps artistic principles!); same as Haseman's number 5

### 7. The principle of the possibility of failure

(rarity of this / epistemic humility) (akin to Popper's falsifiability??) see [[interpretation remains present]] -- very useful for earlier in talk about physics as well

## The questions that shaped this presentation

When I was first approached to talk with you this evening, I was given some questions to help shape my thinking. I'm going to finish by directly addressing these questions. 

### Why should artists require or need a PhD?

My first response is for you to consider your own -- or imagine another -- discipline (let's call it discipline x) and then ask yourselves, "Why should people in discipline x require or need a PhD? 

I imagine there are many different answers: as a stepping stone to a career in research; to learn the fundamentals of research methods; to develop an imaginative research programme that makes a contribution to the field; as a research apprenticeship; to deepen understanding and expertise in the field; to further human understanding. 

Or perhaps the question reflects the idea that there are particular jobs that require or need applicants to have a PhD. What are these jobs and where are they? In universities? In research laboratories? If I were starting a university programme or a research laboratory in Beijing that focused on the arts I would want the most qualified, the most experienced -- the experts -- to be working there. And a PhD is a traditional and trusted way of indicating or qualifying experience and expertise. 

Perhaps though the question is the wrong way around. What if the question were: 'How might we contribute to human understanding through practice research PhD projects?'

In this question we start to see openness and possibility. We see the ways in which practice research PhDs build our understanding of artistic processes, of questions to do with how art is documented, with the interpretive experiences of audiences, with the ways in which art contributes to societal norms and differences and with cultural change, with how experiences of artistic practice change in time and how those changes might help us understand other processes outside the arts. In this way we can see practice research as another method to broaden and deepen human understanding -- an expansion of what it is we come to know, and how we come to know it. After all, any research method is effectively a technology -- a tool -- and the tools we use determine what is possible, what we see, and the nature of the things we make and do. If the very good butcher Pao Ding were to use a different tool or technology to work with the oxen, the results would be very different. 

### What requirements are required to gain this PhD and how should it be evaluated?

I will try the same trick as I did for the first question. What are the requirements to gain a PhD in any discipline and how are all PhDs evaluated? What if practice research PhDs were not at all special? We would have experts in the field evaluate the quality of the contribution that the PhD makes to that field. That's it. 

But this first answer is also not fair or perhaps a little sneaky on my part. Because I think implicit in the question is the idea that art is subjective and therefore can not or should not be evaluated. Is that right? How does one evaluate such intangible things like beauty, aesthetics, taste, and culture, or even the _qualia_ of human experience? These are complex ideas that are fundamental to how we value the arts in our cultures. But I also do not want us to forget that a PhD of any kind is about contributing to human understanding. The means by which that contribution is made should not be important.

### What kinds of artistic practices might best suit doctoral research?

This is a complex question because I have a hunch that some kinds of artistic practices are indeed better suited to research (doctoral or otherwise). In fact, I am in the early stages of a research project to investigate this idea or question. I am increasingly of the opinion -- but it is only an opinion -- that the university should not simply be another place where art is made. Rather, practice research in the university is when artist researchers work through iterative creative practices to contribute to understanding in the field and beyond. Any PhD student who enters the university to do practice research is there to excavate a problem or phenomenom through practice with commitment, rigour and attention to detail. It might be that part of that research process results in an artistic work of some kind, but wanting to make an art work should not be the reason to start a PhD. Therefore, the kinds of artistic practices that might best suit doctoral research are those that developed by artist-researchers who are committed to process, to noticing change, to building understanding (including those aspects of human understanding that are ineffable), and to being open to how that understanding is best communicated.
