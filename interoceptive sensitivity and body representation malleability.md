# interoceptive sensitivity and body representation malleability

_previous note:_ [[definition of body awareness]]

> The results suggest that interoceptive sensitivity predicts the malleability of body representations, that is, people with low interoceptive sensitivity experienced a stronger illusion of ownership in the RHI. Importantly, this effect was not simply owing to a poor proprioceptive representation or differences in autonomic states of one’s body prior to the multi-sensory stimulation, suggesting that interoceptive awareness modulates the online integration of multi-sensory body-percepts. [@tsakiris-2011-just p.2470]

- in other words, people with higher interoceptive sensitivity (which they measured through heartbeat monitoring task) are weaker experience of ownership in RHI
