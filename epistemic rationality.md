# epistemic rationality 

_previous note:_ [[search for truth]]

---

This is a blog post by artifical intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky. He describes two types of rationality: epistemic and instrumental. Epistemic rationality is "systematically improving the accuracy of your beliefs,"[@yudkowsky_what_2009 n.p.] or building more accurate maps. Yudkowsky states that this connection between reality and belief is "commonly called 'truth,'' and I’m happy to call it that."[@yudkowsky_what_2009 n.p.]

Instrumental rationality is about choosing actions and behaviours that encourage personally preferable futures. Yudkowsky calls this "winning."

Yudkowsky's perspective is fundamentally mathematical. For example, the post describes Bayesian formalisms in relation to rationality. But then, he writes:

>There’s a whole further art to finding the truth and accomplishing value _from inside a human mind_: we have to learn our own flaws, overcome our biases, prevent ourselves from self-deceiving, get ourselves into good emotional shape to confront the truth and do what needs doing, et cetera, et cetera.



_questions & thoughts:_

- thinking about relationship between Yudkowsky's description of truth in relation to belief, and what Schein describes in [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]]
- his use of the word _art_ here is fascinating, and I wonder in what way he understands himself to be using the word, and what is it "further" from? (as in "whole further")
- thinking how this might be useful for #finger-pointing-moon -- what would a _rational_ approach built on epistemic rationality and Popper's idea of falsifiability mean in practice? What would such a framing do in the studio? Some kind of line between 'anthing goes and anything can be said about it' (as it currently is in #practice-research) and hypothesis testing. If there were a continuum, practice-research would be closer to the 'anything goes' end, but how close? 
- In #finger-pointing-moon it becomes about language. I can _propose_ or _suggest_ something, but how do I _refute_ something? How certain can I be?
