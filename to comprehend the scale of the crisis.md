# to comprehend the scale of the crisis

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> Collective anxiety about the urgent ecological questions we face, and the challenge to comprehend the scale of the crisis and our influence upon it, is met in our work with a process that seeks to decentre scientific understandings of the weather through movement that travels with the solar system, the biosphere and the solar winds, and that draws down the skies into and through our bodies in movement and vocals that protest and lament.[@brown-2020-hau p.71]


_thoughts & links:_

- I'm not sure I understand the link between how decentering scientific understandings helps to meet the challenge. Is it about agency or recognising (or re-membering) the body as a unit of connection? A node? These are strong ideas in [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time]]
