# Montero - Thought in Action

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself - somatics chapter]]

## LLM summary:

Barbara Gail Montero’s #Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind#.

- **Core claim.** Montero argues that expert performance often _does_ involve conscious thought and attention; the popular “just do it” view—that thinking makes experts choke and that the best action is mindless, automatic, effortless—is a myth. She calls her view **cognition-in-action** and opposes the **just-do-it principle**. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345692809_Thought_in_Action_Expertise_and_the_Conscious_Mind "(PDF) Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind"))
    
- **Targets & context.** She challenges anti-intellectualist takes on skill (e.g., Dreyfus-style phenomenology) and the pop-psych idea that reflection inevitably disrupts smooth action. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345692809_Thought_in_Action_Expertise_and_the_Conscious_Mind "(PDF) Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind"))
    
- **Definition of ‘expert’.** For the book’s purposes, an expert is someone with ~10+ years of deliberate, ongoing practice aimed at improvement—a stipulative but useful working notion. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345692809_Thought_in_Action_Expertise_and_the_Conscious_Mind "(PDF) Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind"))
    
- **Choking & attention.** Montero reviews evidence and cases suggesting that “thinking makes you choke” is overstated. Conscious monitoring and planning can _help_ under pressure; choking is not simply the presence of thought. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345692809_Thought_in_Action_Expertise_and_the_Conscious_Mind "(PDF) Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind"))
    
- **Speed objection.** Even very fast skilled actions can incorporate rapid, structured conscious elements; speed alone doesn’t prove mindlessness. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345692809_Thought_in_Action_Expertise_and_the_Conscious_Mind "(PDF) Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind"))
    
- **Trying, effort, and improvement.** She defends trying hard and sustained effort (not effortless flow) as hallmarks of expertise and continuous improvement, pushing back on slogans like “you can’t try too hard.” ([Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/Thought_in_Action.html?id=VioUDAAAQBAJ "Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind - Barbara Gail Montero - Google Libri"))
    
- **Against folklore.** Iconic stories about inarticulate, purely intuitive experts (e.g., the “mysterious chicken-sexer” who can’t say what they’re doing) are dissected as misleading. ([Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/Thought_in_Action.html?id=VioUDAAAQBAJ "Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind - Barbara Gail Montero - Google Libri"))
    
- **Aesthetics of performance.** Montero distinguishes the _appearance_ of effortlessness (which audiences often value) from the real, effortful control that produces it, and explores the **pleasure of movement**, body awareness, and **proprioception**—arguing proprioception can have aesthetic dimensions for performers and audiences. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345692809_Thought_in_Action_Expertise_and_the_Conscious_Mind "(PDF) Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind"))
    
- **Case material.** Examples span sport, dance, chess, medicine, nursing, and the military, drawing on psychology and neuroscience alongside philosophy. ([Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/Thought_in_Action.html?id=VioUDAAAQBAJ "Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind - Barbara Gail Montero - Google Libri"))
    
- **Chapter arc (selected).** “Don’t think, dear, just do”—her foil; “Just-do-it versus cognition-in-action”; “What is an expert?”; “Does thinking interfere with doing?”; “Thinking fast”; “Continuous improvement”; “You can’t try too hard”; “Effortlessness with effort”; “The pleasure of movement & awareness of the self”; “The aesthetic experience of expert movement”; plus case studies (e.g., chess) and a thematic coda. ([Google Books](https://books.google.com/books/about/Thought_in_Action.html?id=VioUDAAAQBAJ "Thought in Action: Expertise and the Conscious Mind - Barbara Gail Montero - Google Libri"))
    

**Bottom line:** Montero reframes expert action as typically _thoughtful, effortful, and reflective_—without denying automation—showing that conscious control and awareness are not enemies of skill but frequent companions of peak performance.
