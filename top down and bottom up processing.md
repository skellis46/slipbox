# top down and bottom up processing

_previous note:_ [[4e cognition]]

Top-down processing or attention refers to how our brains use previous experience and expectations to interpret information. Bottom-up processing focuses on incoming information or stimuli (through our senses), that _goes up_ to the brain for integration and interpretation. 

A top-down theory of cognition is also known as the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis (BBH) in which:

> all these different cognitive functions rely on an organism's capacity to utilise past experiences and infer future states. The BBH is therefore often portrayed as a so-called ‘top-down’ theory of cognition, where prior knowledge feeds into perception, action and decision-making. [@hipolito-2023-breaking n.pag]

Note this re bottom-up prediction errors:

> Based on its positioning, the insula is able to process both top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors in relation to each other, comparing the two. [@millman-2021-neurocognitive n.pag]
