# dedication to the process

_previous note:_ [[emerging experience]]

(This link is a stretch at best, but how Damasio describes the road to discovery as being _twisted_ is what caught my eye)

Here's another from Nick Cave's The Red Hand Files to go with [[to forgive the unforgivable]]. It's about creativity. Cave says:

> The more dedication you show to the process, the better the work, and the greater your gift to the world. Apply yourself fully to the task, let go of the outcome, and your true voice will appear. Youâ€™ll see. It can be no other way.

From <https://www.theredhandfiles.com/voices-of-all-your-influences/>

He also describes how one's imagination is "an accidental dance between collected memory and influence."
