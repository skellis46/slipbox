# cognitive burden of sitting still

In this podcast Ezra Klein interviews Annie Murphy Paul, the author of _The Extended Mind_.[@paul-2021-extended]. Klein introduces the idea from Murphy Paul's book that sitting places a greater cognitive burden on the brain than standing or walking. He says: 

> One of the pieces of this that I just want to make sure we touch on before we leave this section of the conversation is, and this is not going to sound like a big deal before I say it, so I implore the audience to think of it as a big deal, that sitting still imposes a greater cognitive burden on the brain than standing or walking. And I think that sounds normal enough, and then you realize how much time and energy and social structure and public money has gone into trying to get us to sit still most of the time. And it actually seems quite crazy. So could you talk about that finding?[Klein, in @klein-2021-this n.pag.]

Murphy Paul responds:

> ... we are these biological evolved creatures who are meant to be moving. Being still is not necessarily our natural state, certainly not for long periods of time. And so when we have to be still in an office or in a classroom, we have to inhibit our natural urge to move. And that uses up some of the mental bandwidth that could otherwise be applied to our learning or our work.
