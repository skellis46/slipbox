# art can shape our dispositions

_previous note:_ [[Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature]]

> [David Brooks](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/opinion/art-culture-politics.html): “Does consuming art, music, literature and the rest of what we call culture make you a better person?” Answer:

1.  No. *Consuming* art can’t make anyone better.
2.  But *experiencing* art certainly can make you a better person.
3.  So can experiencing anything else. It depends on you. 

> But, okay, there’s more to say. Anything we experience may, depending on the circumstances, help to make us better people, but we have to be *disposed* to change, willing to change for the better. And maybe one thing art can do is to shape our dispositions, put us in a frame of mind or heart to live differently. [@jacobs-2024-effectual n.pag]
