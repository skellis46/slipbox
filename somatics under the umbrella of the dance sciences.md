# somatics under the umbrella of the dance sciences

_previous note:_ [[Batson et al - Integrating somatics and science]]

> With this in mind, I will first address the problem of somatics as a field of study and explore how it has not been recognized as a separate field of knowledge because it has been collapsed under the umbrella of the dance sciences.[@green-2007-american n.pag]

- somatics as "adjunct" to anatomy and kinesiology
- suggests reason for this connection was that both fields (somatics and dance science) emerged around the same time
- doesn't mention what Ginot describes in [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] about how the starters of somatics called on science to validate itself.
- suggests it is a mistake to continue placing them together
- notes differences in perspectives and approaches with distinct ontologies: 

> Where the sciences generally view the body as an objective entity with particular characteristics that can be observed from a third-person viewpoint, somatics, acknowledges the inner proprioceptive messages that inform the body.[@green-2007-american n.pag.]

This is a curious statement. Both clauses are I think correct, but they aren't really in relationship (ie Green is not comparing the right things).

- describes how we use scientific like metaphors of 'correction' and 'manipulation' and 'control'. Are there really scientific like words? 
- great intro to Foucault and limitations
