# child-sized chairs and a video camera

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]

> These rooms are small and contain nothing but a table, some child-sized chairs and a video camera.  -- Claudia Hammond, Time Warped

Just thinking of this as possible image. Something about the scale of the chairs, the camera.
