# experience as transaction

_previous note:_ [[kinship bid]]

_Article by Keven Walker about AI And experience. Focus here is on aspects that deal with the nature of experience._

* Draws on Dewey to define experience as ongoing transactions between us and the objects and events of the world in which we act, rather than something located inside individual minds

* Emphasises that in transactions both agent and environment are altered, so experience is a mutual, transforming relation rather than a one-way reception of stimuli

* Notes Kolb’s preference for the term transaction over interaction because interaction still implies separate, intact entities, while transaction suggests a fluid relationship that changes both sides

* Links experiential learning cycles to these transactions: concrete experience, reflection, abstraction and application are all phases in which agent–world relations are reconfigured

* Argues that contemporary capitalism has commodified experience by treating these transactional relations as purchasable “experiences” and by converting lived transactions into data that can be owned and traded

* Warns that delegating experience to AI risks letting systems transact with the world on our behalf, further commodifying human experience and distancing us from direct world–self transactions 

* Concludes that if experience is located in transactions with the world, then the world is also in us, so every being can transform the world through these ongoing transactions, and human agency in them should not be surrendered
