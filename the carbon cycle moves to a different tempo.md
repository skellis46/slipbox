# the carbon cycle moves to a different tempo

_previous note:_ [[carbon monitoring as self-improvement]]

> Present CO2 reductions will do little for those currently living on the planet because the carbon cycle moves to tempos different from human lifecycles. As geoscientist David Archer instructs, “After several centuries when the oceans have inhaled their fill, a significant fraction of the fossil fuel CO2 will remain in the atmosphere, affecting the climate for millennia into the future.”20 Calculators are oriented toward an extended present and leave this lag out of the equation. In the final analysis, their temporal orientation correlates to an isolated and unitary conception of homo economicus.[@houser-2016-human p.150]
