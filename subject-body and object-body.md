# subject-body and object-body

_previous note:_ [[embodiment and illusion of self]]

Fuchs and Schlimme present an overview of embodiment and psychopathology from a phenomenological perspective. They describe the subject-body and the object-body (which is built on Merleau-Ponty's work), where the subject-body (Leib) is the body as it is lived, and the object-body (Körper) is the physical body that I can perceive and that can be perceived by others. 

> Normally, the body tends to efface itself in our world-directed activity [27]. However, it appears as an object of conscious attention, particularly when it is inadequate for a task to be performed, be it by a lack of capacity, fatigue, illness or numbness, and whenever it becomes an object for others to whom I feel exposed. In these cases, the body’s performance is made explicit and may often be disturbed. Thus, the body has a double or ambiguous experiential status: both as a ‘lived body’, implicit in one’s ongoing experience, and as an explicit, physical or objective body. An ongoing oscillation between these two bodily modes constitutes a ﬂuid and hardly noticed foundation of all experiencing.[@fuchs-2009-embodiment p.571]


Curious how the term "to whom I feel exposed" hints at judgement and the appearance of the body-object. But the difference between the two doesn't seem to mirror my experiences in [[authentic movement]] and improvisation. In these situations, a more non-dual subjective-objective body. 

- love their use of the term "efface" 
- authors draw analogy with body schema (akin to body-subject) and body image (body-object)
- [[confusing self-consciousness with consciousness]]
- [[losing one's self]]
