# Newport introducing technological determinism

_previous note:_ [[global village]]
  
>Over time, this idea that tools can sometimes drive human behavior became known as technological determinism.[@newport-2021-world n.pag.]

Newport mentions Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death (1985), and notes that Postman studied under McLuhan.

>Postman argues that the format through which mass media is delivered can impact the way a culture thinks about the world.[@newport-2021-world n.pag.] 

>Postman uses this concept to argue, among other points, that the impact of the printing press is deeper than we realize. The standard narrative about this invention is that mass-produced pamphlets and books allowed information to spread faster and farther, speeding up the evolution of knowledge that culminated in the Age of Reason. Postman replies that the influence of the resulting “typographic” culture did more than just speed up information flow; it changed the way our brains processed our world. “Print put forward a definition of intelligence that gave priority to the objective, rational use of the mind,” he writes, “and at the same time encouraged forms of public discourse with serious, logically ordered content.”16 It was this new way of thinking—not just newly available information—that suddenly made intellectual innovations such as Enlightenment philosophy and the scientific method natural next steps. Gutenberg, in other words, thought he was setting information free, but in reality, he was changing fundamentally what information we treated as important.

>A key property of technological determinism is that the innovation in question alters our behavior in ways that were neither intended nor predicted by those first adopting the tool. This idea might make you uncomfortable, as it seems to impart some notion of autonomy to inanimate objects—as if the technology itself is deciding how it should be used. You wouldn’t be alone in your unease: there are many scholars today who steer well clear of determinist analysis, which in recent years has fallen out of fashion in academic circles currently more enamored with theories that understand tools as vectors of social power. But the longer I study the intersection of technology and office culture, the more I’m convinced that in this particular setting, the determinists have something useful to teach us.

>The technologies in question in these studies are not literally deciding how humans should behave, but their effects can be so surprising and sudden to those involved that a story line of tools determining behavior seems as valid as any for describing what’s going on. (The technology scholar Doug Hill uses the term [[de facto technical autonomy]] to describe this effect.) ^cfc387

>The important lesson from Perlow’s work is the haphazard and unplanned manner in which an entirely new way of communicating emerged. The media theorist Douglas Rushkoff [in Present Shock] uses the term “[[collaborative pacing]]” to describe this tendency for groups of humans to converge toward strict patterns of behavior without ever actually explicitly deciding that the new behaviors make sense. ^3f2344
