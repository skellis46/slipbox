# research on, for and in the arts

_previous note:_ [[borgdorff - debate on research in the arts]]

---

Borgdorff distinguishes between three different types of art research: Research on the arts, research for the arts, and research in the arts. His thinking is a variant of Frayling's very early categorisation of Design research _into_, _for_ or _through_ art.[@frayling_research_1993]

Research on the arts has art practice as the _object_ of the research. Borgdorff has also called this the "interpretative perspective"[@borgdorff_debate_2006 p.6] and states that in this kind of research the object is "untouched"[p.6] by the researcher.

Research for the arts is _applied_ form of research in that art is "not so much the object of investigation, but its objective"[p.6] It is research that produces "insights and instruments", "the tools and the knowledge of materials" that are needed by artists. Borgdorff has also called this an "instrumental perspective"[p.6] These are "studies in the service of art practice"[@borgdorff_debate_2006, p.6]

Research in the arts "does not observe a distance between the researcher and the practice of art"[p.7]. It is where the artistic practice is a vital part of the research process and outcome.

_thoughts & links:_

- I'm drawn to this quite simple construction. Frayling's prepositions are a little more confusing, particularly  research "for" art -- which he describes as little r research[@frayling_research_1993 p.5]
- seems unlikely that any practice-research project wouldn't include some aspect of all three (but would be curious to try and delineate them)
- Borgdorff's _research for the arts_ includes my (perhaps conservative) understanding of projects that are developing novel artistic methods to be used by others
- #practice-research 
- [[intuition and the intimate knowledge of a practice]]
- [[art practice and artistic research]]
- [[mäkelä - on reflecting and making in artistic research]]
- see also Scrivener's "Transformational Practice: On The Place Of Material Novelty In Artistic Change", Chapter 15 of Biggs and Karlsson (Routledge Companion to Research in the Arts) -- he's very clear (as ever)
- #unfinished -- add Scrivener, check [[johnson - embodied knowing through art]]
