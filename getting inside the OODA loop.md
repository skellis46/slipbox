# getting inside the OODA loop

_previous note:_ [[knowledge that is localised and fleeting]]

The OODA loop is a cycle of observe -- orient -- decide -- act, and it was developed in the military by John Boyd. The cyclical nature is important and makes it possible to adapt to various environmental circumstances. The _orient_ process is considered the most important "since it shapes the way we observe, the way we decide, the way we act."[John Boyce, in @noauthor-2021-ooda n.pag.] In various contexts -- business, litigation, military conflict, etc -- to get inside the OODA loop describes an advantageous state over one's adversary.
