# the body in artistic research

_previous note:_ [[artistic research and ecosystems]]

This note is materials gathered as part of initial thinking for a Dance Research article that was originally called _the body in the anthropocene_ but that is now called [[artistic research and ecosystems]]. That article changed tack away from the what I saw/see as the changing role of the body in practice-research based on human hubris. To find ways to decentralise the body. Below are un-edited notes that were no longer useful for that writing but that might becomes useful for another article about the body in practice-research. 

> By putting one’s own body and experience forward within a live (arts) space, the artist becomes both object and subject within the frame of the work, and, as a consequence, this situation allows the artist to interrogate and articulate that relationship.[@freeman-2002-writing p.98]

- body in the centre of the room (see Freeman in this zettel) - has nothing to do with [[children of the soil - short description of film]]

> I guess I’m trying to subjectify the universe, because look where objectifying it has gotten us. To subjectify is not necessarily to co-opt, colonize, exploit. Rather, it may involve a great reach outward of the mind and imagination.
> What tools have we got to help us make that reach? - Le Guin, p.M16 [[Le Guin - Deep in Admiration]]

- Le Guin's thinking here marks a very useful tension between the "I" and subjectifying that which is usually objectified. To introduce subjectification as an antidote to objectification. 

> By grounding the self in the body, experimental psychology has taken the body as the starting point for a science of the self. One fundamental dimension of the bodily self is the sense of body ownership that refers to the special perceptual status of one’s own body, the feeling that “my body” belongs to me.[@tsakiris-2017-multisensory p.597]

This body ... [lines from the film?]

what I think I'm getting at is that the 'self' in the body in practice-research is akin to the body in the ecosystem; and perhaps even that by endlessly (and rather haphazardly) using the word embodied we are trying to pull the self into that body but perhaps it sews the division further? Perhaps [[the lived body and embodiment]] is useful here: Husserl, but also other parts of that chapter.  
- am I doing anything different from what the New Materialists have been trying to do? 

> Merleau-Ponty said, ‘Our own body is in the world as the heart is in the organism’ (1986: 205).[@schwartz-2014-this p.317]

> Everything that I know about the world, even through science, I know from a perspective that is my own. (Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, trans. Donald A. Landes (London and New York: Routledge, 2014), 9.  - but cited in Rothfield intro chapter to her book)

## the body and par (potted history?)

> Our human body is part of space and our first reference for inside and outside; it is our first approach to frontiers. (Augé, Non-places 1995) - in [@calderon-2010-intimate p.20]
> my body is the first reference I have in the context of frontiers and limits.[@calderon-2010-intimate p.21]

- note how distinct/different these are from [[Guugu Yimithirr speaker points through himself]]

- after brief description of ineffability (and also just how much autobiography is going on -- little could he have imagined!), Freeman says this (in introduction to book):
> In the context of practice-based research, ineffability is premised on the notion of embodiment as an existential condition: one in which the researcher's performing (doing) body is the subjective source for experience, and it is from this conceptual platform that arguments in favour of practice as research are often launched.[@freeman-2010-ineffability p.3]

"the primacy and sanctity of embodied knowledge" [@freeman-2010-ineffability p.6] (either body of the performer or the body of the work)

> The body in the middle of the octagonal room refers to the artist, his/her intentions, and display. The octagonal room forces the artist at the centre to question relations between artist and public, between inside and outside, ‘in-sight’ and ‘out-sight’, self and other – and the self as other – between the visible and the invisible.[@coessens-2021-artistic p.58]

working through dictionary definitions, Frayling writes (remember he's nutting it out re art and design, much like Carole Gray): 
> for an activity to count in either sense as research the subject or object of research must exist outside the person or persons doing the searching. And the person must be able to tell someone about it.[@frayling-1993-research p.1]

> 15 October 2002: [Susan Melrose] I wonder if some of the implications might be clearer if we identified one particularly problematic area of PaR as ‘Own-Creative-Practice-as-Research’ (OCPaR). Does ANYbody out there want to talk about assessment criteria (let alone judgements of taste and value) which apply here? -- in [@thomson-2003-practice p.160]
- goes further than this when it's our own body doing our own creative practice. Kind of comical in a way. Not surprising just how much autobiographical stuff was happening in early 2000s (which Freeman mentions in intro to Blood, Sweat and Theory)

Draw link between phenomenologists (Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty) and phenomenology and practice-research. as I was starting (in Oz) so little was known about what would come to be known as (at the time) practice-led research. Phenomenology was massively important (Moustakas was big) as a methodological guide for making sense of experience:

> In the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, embodied knowledge is also concretely ‘bodily knowledge’. The _a priori_ of the body assumes the place of the a priori of intellectual knowledge, making the pre-reflective bodily intimacy with the world around us into the foundation of our thinking and acting. By virtue of our bodily constitution and our bodily situatedness in the world, we are capable of ‘getting a grip on reality’ as we observe, learn, and act, and of ‘acting in flow’ prior to any reflection and without following rules.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict pp.168-169]

- or draw link between embodiment of knowledge in the art work (Borgdorff discusses this as does Scrivener) and the double whammy of one whose body is present. double epistemic whack.

> When we listen to music, look at images, or identify with body movements, we are brought into touch with a reality that precedes any representation in the space of the conceptual. That is the abstractness of all art, even after the long farewell to the aesthetics of early Romanticism. In a certain sense, this reality is more real, and nearer to us, than the reality we try to approach with our epistemological projects. This is the concreteness of all art, even in its most abstract forms and contents.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.171]


> The performing body bites back at the thinking mind in a prospective quintessential practice-as-research experiment. -- Kershaw, Chapter 5 of smith-2009-practiceled, p.104

- but what of the dissolution of the body in the Anthropocene. That we are not individual. 
- what might this mean for practice-research? 
- apothesis at moment is "Body Keeps the Score"
- the body is everywhere; embodiment is fashionable. (e.g. in meeting about climate emergency and role of Universities in this) - other examples

> Human bodies can no longer be seen as fortresses to defend against microbial onslaught but must be reenvisioned as nested ecosystems.[@mcfall-ngai-2017-noticing p.M65]

- find a way to have someone (Bob?) respond to this writing as part of the submission?

> The environmental crisis is so extensive and neither temporally nor spatially understandable to an individual that some scholars (such as Carlson, 2002; Berleant, 1995) call for a new environmental aesthetic, which would enable an appreciation of nature from a new point of view. Such a re-situating of human agency into its natural environment is being discussed in new approaches to materialism as well. New Materialism, as it developed as a theoretical field in the humanities since the late 1990s, joins several fields in their common way of re-thinking subjectivity in emphasizing the role non-human powers and processes play on various levels of life and sense-making. In this text I will explore how new aesthetic practices on the intersection of art and design develop forms of incorporating non-human agencies into the lived and sensual experience or expand the human body towards its animated, vital environment. Using concepts from phenomenology, New Materialism, and actor–network theory, I will discuss these practices as examples for a new aesthetic, which is not so much an environmental aesthetic but already goes beyond the systemic approach associated with it. [@forster-2020-figurations p.117]

- perhaps though it's absurd (hyperobjects, and not being able to deal with that scale) -- we don't even connect with like-minded, let alone the distant.
