# bardo

_previous note:_ [[temporal asymmetries (between the past, present, and future)]]

> The Tibetans have the word bardo, which is often applied to the imagined realm you travel through after death. Bardo means “between,” and all human states are actually bardos: Waking is a between state, and dreaming while you sleep is a between. Dying is its own between, and death, when in that imagined life you wander until a rebirth seizes you, is also a between state. Life is understood as intervals between other intervals. So far, so good.[@tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 7 Counting the Stars: A Boring Koan, n.pag.]
