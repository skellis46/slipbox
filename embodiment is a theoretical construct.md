# embodiment is a theoretical construct

_previous note:_ [[embodiment]]

> Non-conventional therapy approaches such as dance movement therapy (DMT) correspond to the theoretical implications of embodiment, highlighting the role of motor movement and sensorimotor experience for mental states and as a medium for therapeutic change. Yet, embodiment is a theoretical construct and not a psychotherapeutic method, and while embodiment approaches provide a rich and sound theoretical framework for psychotherapy (e.g., [[26](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/6/4/24#B26-behavsci-06-00024)]), they are not sufficient for an adequate understanding of all the aspects of the therapeutic approaches falling into their domain.
