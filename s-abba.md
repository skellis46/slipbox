# s'abba

Dear

This email is not my usual shtick. Instead, I'd like to introduce you to a project I'm involved in and then hear your thoughts on it. 

I have worked as a dramaturg slash cook for the choreographers Igor Urzelai Hernando and Moreno Solinas for more than 12 years now and have written about aspects of my work with them in this newsletter previously; e.g. [choreography and needing others](https://mailchi.mp/468d460d6695/choreography-and-needing-others), and [contrived](https://mailchi.mp/367b623edb92/contrived). We have seen each other at our very worst and our very best. We trust each other and we like working together.

Igor, Moreno and I are dreaming and developing a long-term project called _S'Abba_ that we imagine will be a site for many different kinds of people to stay, to work, to rest, to recover, to be together, to learn, to cook and to practice. You can see the very early stages of a website documenting our plans and work at [s-abba.com/](https://s-abba.com/). The place is about 14 ha of land in the northwest of Sardegna which has a building that used to be a pig farm. The location is called Abbacurrente or 'running water' in the [lingua sarda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language). 

One side of the building will be a studio space available for people to make things and to rest into their bodies. The other side of the building will be a shared community space for people to craft and make food together, and where they can stay while visiting the site. Outside we plan to build a large wood-fired brick oven -- [a type of hearth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth) -- around which people can gather to talk, eat, drink and bake slow-fermented bread and pizza (among other things).  

When I tell people about S'Abba I describe it as a place for "people to be together and to rediscover their relationship with the land, with craft and with the body." Perhaps it could be described as an agriturismo (farm-stay) with legs; or a riff on [Min Tanaka's Body Weather Farm](https://www.bodyweather.org/). But we feel clear that it should not only be a space for artists (as much as artists need such spaces). 

My question is this. What do you think about or feel when you read this brief introduction to S'Abba? What comes to mind? What do you like about it? What excites you about it? 

I'd love to hear from you.

x Simon
