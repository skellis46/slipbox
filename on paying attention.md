# on paying attention

_previous note:_ [[how choice happens]]

> When we focus our attention on consciousness, who is it that is being attentive? In other words, which faculty of mind can set the focus to the experience of consciousness? Well, like many of these kinds of questions, much of this seems backwards from the experience of just noticing how consciousness is. It's not that you are focusing your attention on consciousness, you are simply ceasing to be distracted, right, you're ceasing to be identified with thought and with attention itself. 

> The feeling that you can direct your attention is part of this undercurrent of thinking that you're not noticing, right, there's simply consciousness ... already. Everything is appearing on its own, including acts of attention. And the truth is you don't even have to be attentive, you simply have to no longer be distracted, you're ceasing to do something, you're not doing something, the sense that you're doing something is more distraction. Simply notice the next thing that you notice. Something will appear. And meditation is just that. Clearly experiencing consciousness and its contents in each moment, prior to concepts prior to identification with thought.
