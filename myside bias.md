# myside bias

_previous note:_  [[cognitive biases]]

---

The myside bias refers to the tendency to ignore information that contradicts one's own position (the _other side_). The myside bias was first identified by educationalist David Perkins in 1985. It is a form of confirmation bias.

_questions & thoughts:_

- I suspect this is a serious problem in dance scholarship, particular in the writing I see in editorial situations. Indeed, it seems hard to get people to include perspectives that support their own position! By this I mean that there is often not even evidence included to support (let alone evidence that contradicts!)
