# the four immeasurables

_previous note:_ [[everything must  inter-be with everything else]]

> I told him. It came from Buddhism, the Four Immeasurables. "There are four good things worth practicing. Being kind toward everything alive. Staying level and steady. Feeling happy for any creature anywhere that is happy. And remembering that any suffering is also yours." [@powers-2021-bewilderment p.24]
