# Ecosystemic practice-research (working title)

_previous note:_ [[how to think humanity as geologic and vice versa]]

## Abstract

## Introducing the most basic (and moral) of research intentions

In 2002 the theatre scholar Melissa Trimingham expressed frustration at the lack of a clearly articulated methodology for practice-research, and the indifference of artist-scholars towards the "need to communicate and disseminate research findings" [@trimingham-2002-methodology p.54]. Trimingham's response was to propose a broad methodology built on hermeneutics, social science methods, and action research (mention hermeneutic spiral). bold and called for a practice-research methodology that could "account for the disorderly creative process and yet demonstrate rigorous planning" [@trimingham-2002-methodology p.55]. 

some 20 years later -- I think it would be perceived as a conservative approach to the methodological concerns of practice-research. My purpose here is not to get into the pros and cons of Trimingham's proposal, and nor do I wish to dig into how well it was aged (although I think that would be a useful reflection). My intuition is that we have moved further away from calls for clarity and rigour even compared with the wild west days of practice-research in the late 90s and early 2000s. Rather, I want to focus on the epigraph above which comes from just the third paragraph of Trimingham's article, and in which our basic (and moral!) research intention is that the work be for others other than ourselves.

> We cannot afford to dispense with the most basic (and moral) of research intentions: put simply, it must be for the benefit of others apart from the researchers themselves. 

-- Melissa Trimingham [-@trimingham-2002-methodology p.54]

- is Trimingham's statement different from the ecosystem/bubble I am hinting at? My hunch is that the bubble is a sub-set of her thinking.

go into some detail with the statement. Why moral? What about the word _benefit_? Like it's some kind of litmus test. Do I go into implications of it not being true? Who would disagree with it? (which is not to say it's complex to find examples that are exceptions)

For the purposes of this writing I will take Trimingham's statement as axiomatic: that re

this statement is the spine for this writing. Whether you agree with it or not, . A way to draw attention our responsibilities as practice-researchers (use of that pronoun indicates my audience), which are really no different from the responsibilities of researchers in other disciplines even if the epistemic and ontologic conditions of the work we do are starkly different. 

Add here about aim of this writing. Make it plain.

To help understand the implications of Trimingham's assertion for current practice-researchers, I am going to adopt what I suspect is a rather fashionable metaphor. 

## The work table as ecosystem

As I write this section it's early November 2022 and I am standing at the work table of an apartment that belongs to some friends. The table is busier than I would normally work at -- a consequence of a nomadic existence at present. Here's a photograph of the things on the surface of the table; some of them belong to me, others belong to my friends. All of these things have been added to or placed on the table. 

[insert photograph, Simon Ellis, 2 November 2022]

I am going to call the surface of this work table an ecosystem -- as an image with which to keep the potential value of this writing clear, but also in the spirit of the somewhat arbitrary nature of biological systems. It's also useful because a table is not unlike an island, and islands are very useful places on which to study interactions between organisms [@wardle-2002-islands]. At present, describing anything as an ecosystem holds currency in the arts and humanities. For instance, in academic writing in dance and performance[^1] the word _ecosystem_ gets used loosely and broadly, including as an unspecified place human beings live in or inhabit [e.g. @moradian-2021-human; @vicente-2022-turning], as a place akin to nature or the natural [e.g. @sebianeserrano-2020-mestizo], as a entity that needs saving [e.g. @laidlaw-2021-ecological], as a thing to be aware of [e.g. @weig-2021-novel], as a way to understand the body [e.g. @nuding-2021-approaching], as places to encounter [e.g. @mchugh-2021-embodying], and as a metaphor [e.g. @parkinson-2010-art].

[^1]: I did global searches of every issue of four journals: Dance Research (in which the word _ecosystem_ is mentioned in only 1 article); Performance Research (mentioned in 82 articles); Choreographic Practices (7 articles including one of my own editorials); and the Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices (14 articles). 

An ecosystem is, in fact, a "biological system composed of all the organisms found in a particular physical environment, interacting with it and with each other" [@dictionary-2022-ecosystem n.pag.]. I would like to draw attention to three words from this definition: _particular_, _found_, and _interacting_.

The common example of an ecosystem is a pond with its ... How one delineates a pond from the rest of its environment is, in effect, a choice. Should the stones around the outside be included? What about the ground on the outside of those stones? You might call it biological gerrymandering. When we use the word ecosystem -- in its literal or metaphorical sense -- we are describing a _particular_ environment and that particularity needs to be specified. 

The same goes with what is found and the kinds of interactions we might notice. What is found depends on the eyes and technologies we deploy. What are we hoping to see, what are we willing to see, what kinds of attention we are willing to pay. Mention how perspective changes based on who is looking? = Observer effect (distinct from uncertainty principle). How things are in relationship to each other, how they interact and change, modify, adapt each other. How they move and are moved by other aspects or organisms in the ecosystem.

A way to mark our understanding, or even the limitations of our perspectives.

## Two surprising things in the table as ecosystem

While I was clearing the table of the stuff that did not belong to it I discovered -- or _found_ -- two surprising things. First was a small piece of graffiti-like text, etched into the table, that said: _it must be for the benefit of others_. Second, I found a video artwork embedded into the surface of the table. 

These discoveries mean that in this table as ecosystem we have: i) a challenge for practice-researchers published on paper in 2002 by Melissa Trimingham, and then introduced by force into the table sometime between then and the end of 2022; and ii) a video artwork presented as practice-research which is called _Children of the Soil_ [@ellis-2022-children], and that was introduced to the table very recently in 2022. Neither the video nor the text made it onto this table by themselves and so we cannot call them native.

This writing now branches into two hypothetical scenarios that explore how this video work (acting as a proxy for all practice-research) interacts with the etched challenge: _it must be for the benefit of others_. Both scenarios describe approaches to **making sense of this table as ecosystem** [this isn't right - not about making sense of table as ecosystem but how I use the table as ecosytem to communicate the work], and in particular attitudes to how we understand the particularities, interactions of the ecosystem, and what might be found -- or introduced -- depending on how we look. 

## Hypothetical scenario 1: inherent

keep in mind interacting, found, particular. 

For this scenario I acknowledged the delicate balance of the ecosystem, and my goal was not to introduce any new or unfamiliar species. Indeed, as my eyes, senses and desires (observer effect) adjusted to the particularities of the work table top, I started finding new materials and interactions peculiar to the ecosystem. The part of the ecosystem most useful was the video artwork _Children of the Soil_. 

For example, within the video I can clearly see the influence of graphic novels, and thinking and practices that relate to the term more-than-human coined by David Abram and _The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-Than-Human World_ (New York: Vintage, 1996) -- check this (got this from Bridle)

These are not abstract entities, constructed by me or others and then introduced for some unstated reason. They are aspects of the work table as ecosystem that are inherent to the video artwork in particular.  


- what are the strands of research dialogue for children of the soil?
	+ graphic novels  
	+ other-than-human  
	+ screendance  
	+ eco-somatics  
	+ temporal experiments in film

## Hypothetical scenario 2: invasive species

a bubble-like version of COTS that references other works that it is not in dialogue with or can never be in dialogue with. Use an example of the bubble and just how common it is. All dead men. Tone is "I could do this." Renders the work inert. Like burying it, or putting it in a coffin with these men. These are different ecologies. Can I describe without judging? Talk to implications of. Like entering a crowded bar in which no one pays you any attention whatsoever. Can't order a drink. Nothing. No matter how much you tell people "I am here." More akin to gerrymandering


## analysis - why this matters (contribution)

Ben Rawlence is ... and his book _Treeline_ traces the 

> If who you are is one creature embedded in an ecosystem along with many others, then healing means restoring you to that inherited role ... [@rawlence-2022-treeline p.215] 

[[Rawlence - The Treeline#^1445bb]]

> We can’t manage an ecosystem! What hubris to think human beings can enter into millions of interconnected, complicated, refluxing, pricking, stinging, collaborating relationships, and manage it. [@ducann-2022-my n.pag.] - this could be the epigraph. That we are managing and it doesn't work.

This Strand quote is from [[collapse is generative]]

The distinction between Rawlence's thinking and Strand's is that Rawlence is discussing being aware of our place in an ecosystem, whereas Strand is talking about the hubris of attempting to control an ecosystem. 

> Ecology teaches us that we exist by virtue of our ties to one another and to the more-than-human world, and that those ties are strengthened, not weakened, by the inclusion and equal participation of each and every member of that network. The strength and resilience of computational networks, the inherent power of distribution and interconnection, teaches us the same.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag.]

Bridle (for Anthropocene )

Use of ecology here as metaphor: [[Bridle - Ways of Being#^2568db]] - finding connections between all things

Also - Bridle's discussion of solidarity. Side by side. 

- egosystem vs ecosystem (vertical literacy): <https://medium.com/presencing-institute-blog/vertical-literacy-12-principles-for-reinventing-the-21st-century-university-39c2948192ee>
- making epistemological error of choosing the wrong unit (Bateson, here in Bridle post: <http://booktwo.org/notebook/let-the-river-live/>):
> When you narrow down your epistemology and act on the premise “What interests me is me, or my organization, or my species,” you chop off consideration of other loops of the loop structure. (from Bateson, cited in Bridle blog post above)
- the difference though (talking about Bateson's eco-mental) is that the artist-scholar in this circumstance remains untouched by their plea to a particular ecosystem of thought and ideas. Or is it that they get but don't give. They gain warrant, validation, an argument from authority


> Against this background, the negotiations of sense at the interfaces of arts and academia—in Henk Borgdorff’s (2010) terms, “boundary work”—concern also the registers of sense and the questions of whether, how, and why some of them are prioritised over others. [@elo-2018-ineffable p.282]
- I include this quote here as perhaps something to consider when I discuss ecosystem edges and why we prioritise singular (in Steyerl's term) over dialogue

- also [@schindler-2020-negotiation] on boundary objects in practice-research (based on work of Star and Griesemer) -- it might be possible for me to argue that artistic-researchers use theory/text as a boundary object (texts constructed by others, and not as part of collaborations) -- it's a stretch though and certainly not at all close to what Star and Griesemer are talking about.

### PaR bubbles

- yes, I add a version of this work in this way -- I do this labour as a thought experiment and to implicate myself (can also given examples of when I've done this previously)
- offer to 'write about my practice'; this is what we do in practice-research. the various journals dedicated to practice-research are filled with practitioners in their bubble attempting to convince us of the value of their work. No, not convince us (that would be more palatable), rather, expect us to recognise the value of their work. Noting just how much this diverges from Strand's claim that [[I am a collaboration]] (see backlinks in that note for extended thinking on individuation/individualism)
- see [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]] of epistemic claims. 
- other examples: Freeman book (?), JAR (take random issue), CHOR (of which I'm co-editor). 
- I'm guilty. 
- perhaps more guilty given the unsurprising focus of dance practices on the body. I've even started calling them body-based practices as my curiosity has stretched away from codified dance practices (including improvisation). -- extracted most of my notes on this to [[the body in artistic research]] but I wonder if it can be included very briefly. That pull is strong.
- Noting that it's _easier_ to find theoretical work to be in relation with. It's there. It's desk work. It's more tangible (which is ironic given body in performance work?)
- more like a foreign body dropping into a pre-existing ecosystem; isolated; argument from authority; these are singular systems (Steyerl).


#### looking at the JAR 26 (arbitrary) - could also add V27

- like a battle for newness; constant claims to originality; I can't unsee it now; certainly approximates Steyerl's singularity thinking
- Ali Mousavi - Acoustemological Investigation: Sound Diary Tehran - 2022
	- in relation to theory: Ricoeur, Foucault, Baudelaire, etc
	- no mention of a single artist with a similar or overlapping practice
- Pavel Prokopic - Affective Atmosphere: A Non-Representational Method of Devising Film Performance and Fiction
	- "the project meaningfully applies philosophical concerns to filmmaking"
	- "key concepts of Deleuze and Guattari, and theoretical writings on atmosphere (Böhme, Griffero) and film performance (Benjamin, Del Río)"
	- no mention of another artwork or current (or dead!) artist
- Ella Raidel - Of Haunted Spaces
	- Bergson, Debord, 
	- discusses influences but no sense of engaging with other researchers working with similar themes, methods, geographies
- Geetanjali Sachdev - Petals to Light...Pedagogic Possibilities with Floor Art
	- nope, not another artist mentioned as entirely unique
- David Szanto & Geneviève Sicotte - Research-Creation about and with Food: Diffraction, Pluralism, and Knowing
	- bring the two works (by the two authors) in dialogue with each other
	- nope, nothing else though
- Katharina Swoboda - Zoological Architectures and Empty Frames
	- Butler, 
	- but what is the practice? who is it in relation to? 
	- little sense of this (but definitely better than the others)

- compare with Schwab in describing a piece of knowledge as an artefact of communication: [[experimentation is social#^da953d]] - so if this is plausible, who then is doing the communicating? (if it isn't artist-researchers)
- perhaps though Schwab's concern for how artworks are provisional ([[schwab - experimental systems#^279252]]) (ie epistemic things filled with epistemic potential) is fundamental to the expositions in JAR as being starting points or seeds. But where does that leave us? Scattering seeds everywhere (seeds dependent on theory-as-water).
- "What I’m objecting to is the use of names as talismans." [Chamberlain, in @thomson-2003-practice p.176] - referring to Kant. I think I have same objection.
 
Noting "focuses on their practice" from SW's original invitation -- just take a sample, perhaps there will be exceptions that prove the rule. But this is the unspoken practice: that when we write about artistic practice we don't write about how it is part of an ecosystem ([[difference between ecology and ecosystem]]) of practice. We tend to write about it as part of alternative ecosystems (ones that are not at all aware that the practice exists and nor would they care). It fails to be in dialogue. Not surprising in a nascent form in the academy we'd choose to be in relation to authorities (philosophical, cultural). We lean on them to prop up the status of our work. This is as old (or young) as PaR -- remember conversations from PARIP in 2003. Perhaps though this is a matter of choice: the connections we choose to make. Why then would we choose these other ecosystems? What does it say about us? 

Curious that for all the word's utility in performance writing, in practice-research we exist in bubbles: these are ecosystems of theory, with borders and boundaries constructed by authors to validate an artistic practice.

Curious also re [[a claim to specificity clashes with a claim to singularity]] and [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]]. Steyerl writes how practices of artistic research "usually partake in both registers". Usually? Note in that blog post on Steyerl I discuss 'at least 3 ways' artists are in relationship with others -- but they are a mess and need clarification (they might have made sense at the time but not now)

### we have never been individuals

> Whatever we say, we’re always talking about ourselves.
—Alison Bechdel (in Kleon's "show your working")

- see also [[to define the meaning of we]] and [[the decline of we and us]], [[I am a collaboration]]

> Collective behavior begins not as an internally generated algorithm but rather in the midst of encounter. “When one ant touches another with its antennae, it decides whether the other ant is a nestmate,” she explains. From tiny interactions such as these, colonies develop foraging strategies and reproductive trajectories, not as “individuals,” but as encounters in motion.[@tsing-2017-individuals p.M72] [this text is introducing Chapter 7 by Deborah M. Gordon]

- "we have never been individuals" - [[Gilbert - Holobiont by Birth#^3d3b10]]; also [[I am a collaboration]] (Sophie Strand)
- any use in Mary Louise Pratt's thinking about "Imperial Eyes" (p.G173 of Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet) (it's actually a book) -- thinking about 'contact zones' but as places where the individually-focused arts practitioner meets the world (this is a total stretch)
- I really do not want anthropocene in the title. But we (humans) are always "at the centre of the narrative" (p.G173). "Its story is still all about an 'us.'" - Mary Louise Pratt, Coda, G173
- irony of self-authored article
- note also Freeman's mention of Montaigne about self-writing in [@freeman-2002-writing]


## miscellaneous -- not yet certain

- use of word 'traceability' in Vis [[artistic research and traceability]] -- useful as I describe the map?
- Which of Schiesser's [[five main positions on practice research]] is this writing based on?
- perhaps large (non-human body) images sprinkled throughout - with 'this body' on top?

# note from Sarah

> I have been talking to Richard Ralph, editor of Dance Research and who has asked me to take on editing an issue of the journal with a focus on practice research. The idea is to invite key practitioners to contribute some writing that focuses on their practice. Might you have something that could emerge from your current research in Italy (for example)?  We would be looking for something to be submitted in early January. There is no specific length requirement as we want the contributions to find their own form (images are welcomed but not required, as well as links, as appropriate). -- email from SW, 29 June 2022

# edit bin

an example of COTS in dialogue (see below re graphic novels, non-human, etc) -- it would have to be absurdly brief but I could also show more detail in some kind of diagram. Earlier question: Is it worth -- re Children of the Soil -- to do a very brief mapping of who/how it is in relation to other practices? 
The distinction is that for one of the 2 versions above I am already a part of an ecosystem. The other is an abstraction.

understanding and illustrating Two things I could do. This artwork is COTS. What the work is is not so important -- these scenarios exist for all art that is presented through practice-research. 

Let's say that the artistic work and the piece of graffiti were introduced (by humans) into this ecosystem at an unknown time.

What is inherent or native to the work and what might I choose to add to this ecosystem? (contrast native vs introduced -- what's that word?) 

So now things are clear. We have a basic and moral research intention proposed by Melissa Trimingham -- a part of which is etched into the work table -- and a video artwork,  

but they are also a part of the work table's ecosystem -- like the grain, density and colour of the wood, the glue holding the planks together, and the surface's wear and tear.

So, we have an artistic work and a piece of graffiti that are part of the table's ecosystem. 

The Finnish Nigerian journalist Minna Salami's speaks of the value in having an image to hang an idea from; that images are "really good for explaining and bringing people on board" [@lawson-2022-other pp.151-152]. 

So now things are clear. We have a basic and moral research intention proposed by Melissa Trimingham -- a part of which is etched into the work table -- and a video artwork,  

but they are also a part of the work table's ecosystem -- like the grain, density and colour of the wood, the glue holding the planks together, and the surface's wear and tear.

So, we have an artistic work and a piece of graffiti that are part of the table's ecosystem. 

Please suspend your disbelief. 

What is inherent to the table? -- certainly the histories, citations of Trimingham. What if I place an artistic work of mine on this table? What is inherent? Interacting.

Think of it as an empty space on which to place things, and of the things that place themselves on it after my choices.

The desk I am working on -- do I include the trestles holding it up? What then of the floor on this first floor? And the structures holding up that floor. And the organisms working away in the wood of the table top? None relevant to this writing except to say they might have some effect on how I perceive myself in this ecosystem. Image of table -- or desktop. Importance of choice.

- Perhaps where we choose to delineate ecosystems is just that: a choice (like gerrymandering). A way to mark our understanding, or even the limitations of our perspectives. Perhaps not so far from [[a border is not a boundary]]
- see here for comparison with biome, biosphere and ecosystem: <https://socratic.org/questions/what-is-the-relationship-between-the-biosphere-a-biome-and-an-ecosystem> -- note point about "given environment." and also biotic and abiotic aspects of an ecosystem.

Also in extended use: a complex system resembling this" [@dictionary-2022-ecosystem n.pag.].

The thing about the word _ecosystem_ is that it can be used quite fluidly. Gerrymandering. 

Example from 1935 (from OED):

> A. G. Tansley in _Ecology_ **16** 306 The fundamental concept appropriate to the biome considered together with all the effective inorganic factors of its environment is the _ecosystem_, which is a particular category among the physical systems that make up the universe.

I'm going to deploy it as a metaphor; not least because of its currency in writings about climate emergency. 

Resist writing about a work of mine even though the invitation was to "focus on my practice." I'd rather let the practice do its own work. There are too many words written about the practices of artists, especially by the artists themselves.

### word searches 'ecosystem'

_Dance research_: just 1 article: 'Site, Adapt, Perform: A Practice-as-Research Confrontation with Climate Change' by Melanie Kloetzel (2017) - practice-research (not surprising)

_CHOR_: 7 articles (including one of my editorials)

_PR_:  82 articles in Performance Research

_JDSP_: 

- 14 articles:
- Moradian: ecosystem as something we live in (ie external to us); lip service to it really [@moradian-2021-human p.13] (also mentions exteroception -- just as a note here) -- this is common and something that Latour describes as deanimating the Earth and thereby robbing it of agency (through science objectifying the planet) -- see Kloetzel for this reference to Latour [@kloetzel-2017-site pp.121-122]
- Vicente: ecosystem as place to inhabit - "as if by changing my body I was at the same time changing the ecosystem in which it is grounded" (p.81); also equating to 'natural world' (p.84) in the sense of reducing distant between spectator and 'global ecosystem' (which is a good thing) [@vicente-2022-turning p.84]
- both these two (Moradian and Vicente) are drawing on that difficult thing of the body as subject and object (like interoception) that Leder discusses in Chapter 17 of The Interoceptive Mind ([[the lived body and embodiment]]); like we have to separate ourselves to talk about the body (ourselves) -- is this a discrete problem from, say, autoethnography?
- Laidlaw: role of humans "within the ecosystem" (human as guardian/saviour of that which we separate ourselves through language); [@laidlaw-2021-ecological p.105]
- Weig: use of word ecosystemic; metaphor of fascia in body (body first body first body first!) - "ways of shaping community, honouring human ecosystemic nestedness, and coming to appreciate Earth as co-guider in eco-somatic practices" [@weig-2021-novel p.55]; describes more-than-human ecosystemic aliveness (p.56). Focus in general in this article on ecosystemic awareness. The article is perhaps an example of trying to speak of more than human or of not separating ourselves from *the* ecosystem. Perhaps use of definite article is useful/intriguing? 
- Bettmann: article about eco-somatics; one use of word 'ecosystem' deployed as "her ecosystem" -- sense of belonging (not separate); [@bettmann-2021-public p.43]
- Kampe et al: editorial for volume on eco-consciouness (that most of above are part of). They say "embodied eco-consciousness" which in itself speaks volumes about body body body. [@kampe-2021-embodying]
- Nuding takes ecosystems into the body (microbial) -- adopts critical framing of eco-somatics (p.34). "Instead of cultivating embodied understandings of entanglement, does it not risk reinforcing concepts of nature as something ‘out there’, as an exoticized other to be appropriated for human experience?" [@nuding-2021-approaching p.34]:

> However, the reconfiguration of human/nature and nature/culture has relevance far beyond disciplines and discourse directly concerned with landscape; these binary constructions are inherent aspects of what Stein calls ‘the modern-colonial habit-of-being’, which ‘rests first and foremost on a foundational separation of humans from each other and the rest of nature (other-than-human beings)’(2019: 199).[@nuding-2021-approaching p.35]

- Kussmaul and Longley -- mention of permeability of ecosystems (at end, p.151) -- more sensitive; less like "out there" [@nuding-2021-approaching p.34] which seems more common; mention of fascia (but haven't yet looked into overlaps with Weig?); critiques inside/outside binary [@kussmaul-2021-queer p.151]
- McHugh on embodying nature: "Eco-consciousness has its foundation in an active relationship between the individual soma and the larger body of the natural world" [@mchugh-2021-embodying p.125]. Makes me think we can't avoid that me/it discrepancy. But this statement makes it about a question of scale and that's just too simplistic. And also as if we are somehow unnatural; describes (more specifically than others) ecosystems: "encounters with available ecosystems such as ocean, woods, rivers and meadows" [@mchugh-2021-embodying p.128]
- Fraleigh [@fraleigh-2021-body] uses phrase in relation to Japanese writer Yasuo and as humans being integral to ecosystems; talks about finding nature (noting from NAHR time that the concept of nature/natural no longer really exists -- everything is touched)
- Sebiane Serrano [@sebianeserrano-2020-mestizo] seems to use the term in very loose way (more like something in fashion/vogue)
- Caetano et al: more like humans and ecosystems (out there) [@caetano-2020-performing]
- Sarco-Thomas [@sarco-thomas-2014-touch p.198] refers to Chrysa Parkinson's art practice as ecosystem questionnaire. <https://nivel.teak.fi/adie/art-practice-as-eco-system-questionnaire/>. Sarco-Thomas also uses the word 'ecology' a lot but doesn't clarify why (or even what she might mean by it). Sense that this is about fashion -- of appealing to nature. Neither does Parkinson but the sense of an ecosystem (as metaphor) is more clearly implicit.

There are two books (not mine), an old watch, a folder or two, some pens, pens holders, insta-photographs from a recent wedding, a lamp, some stickie notes. A speaker, power. A tablet, a case, headphones. 

- attempt to do a little dance here -- to introduce some research while attempting to reach out beyond my solipsism to attempt to understand how that research might be useful to you. That this writing is not _about_ this particular research project (called [[children of the soil - short description of film]])
- get the project out of the way: a short photo essay as part of the writing -- perhaps 6 images occupying a single page? (in a grid) -- perhaps even with some of the graphic novel texts

The second is from the American artist and writer Sophie Strand who describes ecological storytelling as "held between the ripe and the rot" [@ducann-2022-my p.83] (from _As You Like It_). I think it's a useful image to imagine all practice-research as being held between the ripe and the rot. 

- might I be able to fold in interoception/soil/de-corpification/eco-anxiety? (ha ha)
