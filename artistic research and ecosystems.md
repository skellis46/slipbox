An opportunity to draw together threads of thinking that I've sat with for some time. Adapts, updates and builds on presentation from Leeds and blog post (link to) -- as early endnote?


## Abstract

This writing is an attempt to make sense of the "mangle of practice" [@pickering-1995-mangle] [^alys] in a deliberate and precise yet vulnerable (honest?) way. I want to underline the danger of cohesion, and that the stories we tell about practice-research tend to value coherence over mess even when the defining (epistemic) characteristic of making art (and indeed doing practice-research) is mess. And that that coherence is almost always argued from authorities[^anna] that lie outside the communities of practice for artists and artist-scholars. That there is pressure to tell stories of clear (and impactful) findings, discoveries, aims and objectives which are at odds with the reality of art-making (whether in the academy or outside of it, whether it is deemed research-ful or not). About the choices we (practice-researchers) make to dress up our research to operate more cleanly (or fluidly) in the machine of the academy. To lubricate this machine. In doing so, we perform a disservice to art-making processes and outcomes, the epistemic possibilities of practice-research, and a disservice to the academy itself (thinking here of broader understandings of ways of knowing). It also impoverishes practice-research. 

## Introduction: retrofitted practice research

This writing is not specific to dance practice research -- generally about practice research using dance as examples. Informed by my understanding of body-based research processes, using mostly expanded choreography examples.

The quality of academic research in the United Kingdom is publicly evaluated approximately every five years through REF: the Research Excellence Framework.[^ref] The REF has 34 units of assessment divided into four broad disciplinary panels. Following REF 2021 the Overview Report from the panel for Music, Drama, Dance, Performing Arts, Film and Screen Studies (Panel D, unit of assessment 33) stated that:

> A small proportion of practice research outputs appeared to retrofit research questions and a research-based process to work that was created with other agendas or purposes in mind.[@noauthor-2022-overview p.193] 

The panel is unequivocal in suggesting that to retrofit research questions or a research-based process is a _negative_ thing, yet what does retrofitting mean? 

As a provocation to consider the nature of practice research, I propose that the panel's feedback inadvertently opens an old wound in practice research by implicitly distinguishing making art as research from _merely_ making art. This distinction is not new. 

In 2003, Peter Thomson[^thomson] presented an edited account of conversations on the SCUDD list-serv[^list] debating practice-research. The text includes a list of fifteen questions developed by Angela Piccini for the 2003 Practice as Research in Performance (PARIP)[^parip] conference in Bristol. The sixth of Piccini's questions directly addresses the tension between art made as art and art made as research: 

> What makes an instance of practice ‘count’ as research? Does [practice research] involve different methods as a result of its framing as research (as distinct from ‘pure’ practice)?[Piccini, in @thomson-2003-practice p.161]

Hovering over Piccini's question is the potential that not all art can be positioned as research. In 1993 Christopher Frayling expressed the concern that if all art is research then we might end up "in a position where the entire history of art is eligible for a postgraduate research degree".[@frayling-1993-research p.5] 

Presupposing that the REF panel's feedback was referring to art made as art that was retrofitted as practice research, then the panel's feedback implies either a) not all art can be positioned as research; or b) some retrofitting processes were not adequately hidden or disguised for the purposes of the REF. Both possibilities have strong implications for understanding practice research. If (a) is accurate then it follows that there are two categories of art vis-à-vis the academy: art that can not be positioned as research, and art that can. If (b) is accurate, then there must be better and worse ways to retrofit art as practice research. Putting aside what retrofitting might even mean (and I speak to this in the next section), it is self-evident that there are better and worse ways to retrofit art as practice research, just as there are better and worse ways to hit a tennis ball, bake bread or articulate a scholarly argument -- even if those 'ways' are not obvious, demand time and practice, and are not necessarily or easily falsifiable.[^harford] 

What if retrofitting is a necessary part of practice research methods? 

This writing is built on two ideas.  

The first is axiomatic (and likely unpopular): all art can be framed as practice research. If this were not the case, we would need to establish specific conditions, types, methods, processes, practices, outcomes, etc that prevent any art from being framed as such. This is implausible to say the least. Note that this axiom is different from saying that all art _is_ practice research. Rather, all art _is able to be_ framed or positioned as practice research.

The second is the proposition that artistic activity in the academy is nearly always framed as practice research _post hoc_, and that this is equivalent to the retrofitting described by the REF panel. In a sense this proposition is concerned with _when_ arts practices are framed as practice research, and the seeds and implications of this timing. I will focus on providing evidence as to why post hoc framing of practice research must be the case, and that to suggest otherwise is to denature the complex inter-relationships between art-making and art rendered as research. 

## The _when_ of practice research: ab ovo and post hoc

Here is a continuum for _when_ an artistic process or activity somehow connected to the academy is framed, described and/or disseminated as practice research. 

add image here.

At one end of the continuum are artistic projects that start and finish as practice research. These are _ab ovo_: literally meaning “from the egg” or from the beginning.[@noauthor-2021-ovo] At the other end are artistics projects that are not framed as practice research until or after they are presented or finished. These are _post hoc_ "occurring after the event [or] done with hindsight".[@noauthor-2022-post] 

The continuum reveals nothing of the quantity or quality of the researchfulness of an artistic process or activity. There are many examples of deeply researchful artistic projects (inside and outside of the academy) that are either never framed as practice research, or only framed post hoc when required. Likewise, but perhaps less commonly, there can be ab ovo practice research that is devoid of researchful practice. The continuum above refers only to _when_ the framing as practice research occurs. 

Anecdotally, ab ovo practice research is rare, and even projects initiated as practice research are complicated by the profoundly ad hoc nature of artistic practices and art making (which I discuss in the next section on p.xx). Practice research PhDs are likely the most common form of ab ovo practice research, in which a PhD candidate claims the method or approach from the start of their doctoral studies, even if they are not experienced in working with and through the approach. The process of doing a practice research PhD usually involves the artist-student coming to understand what a practice research PhD entails, and how it is distinct from simply making a work of art. Through difficult first-hand experience they come to understand practice research's pitfalls, contexts, possibilities, framings, principles and even codes. 

Artistic work that is framed post hoc as practice research is as common as ab ovo is rare. For example, I have submitted 12 research outputs across three UK research assessment processes in 2008, 2014 and 2021. Of these, 11 were practice research, and of these eleven, 10 were framed as practice research post hoc. The exception was _Indelible_[@ellis-2003-indelible] for RAE2008 -- an adaptation of my PhD research that was as ab ovo as it could be (despite not having heard of the term practice-led research when I started the process).[^maybe]

Here at the Centre for Dance Research, Coventry University, we submitted 17 practice research outputs to REF2021. All of these submissions were artistic works framed as practice research post hoc.

It is my strong suspicion, therefore, that the majority of practice research outputs submitted to REF in the UK will have been framed as practice research post hoc. The artists involved will have had varying degrees of experience and understanding of practice research, and the ideal scenario is that the artist understood practice research first hand, but held off framing their work as practice research until after it was presented, exhibited and/or shared. Holding off this framing would have prevented their artistic processes and activities from being encumbered with the labels and structures of practice research ab ovo. Why encumbered? To understand that, we must enter the mangle of ad hoc practices. 

## the mangle of ad hoc practices

In _The Mangle of Practice_ (1995) the sociologist and historian of science Andrew Pickering describes the practice and culture of science as "performative"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.7]; an unpredictable "dance of agency"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.21] in which the mangle of scientific practice represents a "dialectic of resistance and accommodation".[@pickering-1995-mangle pp.22-23]. 

Pickering's analysis is important in science as it draws together divergent understandings of objectivity; between Pickering's "emergent and posthumanist"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.198] mangle of practice, and more traditional "humanist rules of mental hygiene"[@pickering-1995-mangle p.198] in which scientists avoid ad hoc modifications and create only falsifiable theories. But in artistic practices is not the mangle of practice a given? 

When I mentioned the messiness of artistic practice during an informal C-DaRE team conversation late in 2022, my colleague Jonathan Burrows simply asked, "Isn't that self-evident?"[@burrows-2022-selfevident] In Burrows' book _Writing Dance_[@burrows-2022-writing] his poetic description of the development of the performance work _Rewriting_[@burrows-2019-rewriting] conveys the essentially unforseeable fragments, misteps, accidents and practices of the project. The writing gives the sense that it remains fortuitous that the work was ever ready to present. From the outside, the making of _Rewriting_ seems only vaguely planned, if at all. Pickering quotes the anthropologist of science Lucy Suchman: 

> Plans are best viewed as a weak resource for what is primarily ad hoc activity ... Stated in advance, plans are necessarily vague, insofar as they must accommodate the unforeseeable contingencies of particular situations.[Suchman, _Plans and Situated Actions_ 1987 p.ix, in @pickering-1995-mangle p.21 (footnote 34)]

Something _ad hoc_ is makeshift; an emergency; it is improvised, impromptu and expedient. As a transitive verb it is to "practise or create by using ad hoc measures, typically without recourse to method, policy, etc.; to assemble or organize chaotically".[@noauthor-2021-ad] 

To work in an ad hoc manner in artistic practice -- as it is in science -- is a feature not a bug. Ad hocness in artistic practice is elemental regardless of _when_ (or if) we decide to frame artistic activity as practice research. The fusion of uncertainty, contingency and intuition that we call creative practice makes it startingly pragmatic to delay and delay the post hoc labour of framing the artistic activity as practice research. Perhaps even in what is ostensibly an ab ovo practice research project, the unforseeable nature of ad hoc practices -- the "unsystematic drifting, serendipity, chance inspirations"[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.165], the adaptations and missteps -- ought to encourage or even force the artist to hold off as long as possible from making research-oriented claims about their artistic activity. Burrows describes "an alternative picture of research that is a reality for many of us":[@burrows-2022-writing p.29]

> in which intuition is the heart of creative practice and requires us to set off without a map into an unknown territory, intelligently, our eyes open, scouring the horizon for clues, with not a written proposal in sight and no assessment procedure possible.[@burrows-2022-writing p.29] 

That moment though -- of _when_ -- is important: that moment when one decides how to make claims about the research-ful nature of their artistic practice. It is a moment in which the _practice_ of practice research bifurcates between the work that the artistic activity does as art, and the work that it does as research through its framing as such. Yet, in thinking through and articulating this split, the simplistic (yet pragmatic) nature of the binary of the artwork and its post hoc framing as research reveals itself. 

## bifurcation: the artistic work and its framing as research

In _The Conflict of the Faculties_ (2012) Henk Borgdorff states that "[practice] research addresses itself both to the academic forum and to the forum of the arts",[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.167] and that it is "directed first of all to the art world."[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.167] 

The responsibility to these two forums or audiences that Borgdorff describes is complex, although how I might present my work to the artistic community is likely the easier or more familiar part. Our artist selves understand the expectations, economies, currencies, processes, codes and needs of the artistic world to which we belong. The artwork will exist somewhere along various continuums: seen or not seen; sold or not sold; reviewed kindly or not reviewed at all; it will be fashionable or not fashionable; liked or not liked; talked about or not talked about; remembered or forgotten. How the work was made -- including even the nature of its underlying practices -- is mostly if not completely irrelevant, and how the work functions epistemically might be _felt_ as it circulates in the aether, but it is never discussed directly. 

The contrast is clear for artistic practice in the academic community. Although it is axiomatic that _artistic practice_ is fundamental to practice research in the arts,[@bulley-2021-report] the artistic practice and the emergent artwork are not the same thing. 

Henk Borgdorff writes that, "art practice is paramount as the subject matter, the method, the context, and the outcome of artistic research".[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.146] There's a seductive sleight of hand in Borgdorff's statement, and he makes it too easy to infer that an art practice ends up as an artwork which is thereby synonymous with the outcome of practice research. But what does Borgdorff mean by art practice? Previously, he has described it as "both the art object and the creative process"[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.18], yet Jonathan Burrows makes a clear distinction: 

> I write a note on my phone saying 'practice is a ghost-like activity', by which I think I mean that this doing which is not yet art is inhabited always by the ghost of other work, which points insistently towards what might slip over into art.[@burrows-2022-writing p.25]

In other words, given how fluid, ghost-inhabited, unpredictable and uknowable is artistic practice, the emergent outcome called an artwork is not necessarily indicative of the researchful nature of the artistic practice. It is entirely plausible that a complex, rigourous and insightful artistic practice does not ever slip over into art. Or what happens in the case of ab ovo practice research PhD projects in which the postgraduate researcher seems to be required to engage with open-ended practice research methods rather than have the much clearer option to make an artwork and then frame it as research? 

Perhaps these two not so dissimilar situations are why it is easiest for a practice researcher to simply put on their artist hat and go about the complex and contingent process of making an artwork. Once the artwork is done _then_ they can start discussing how it is best framed as research or, often more appropriately, deciding which aspects of the process and/or artwork are researchful. But this will not do. It is too limited to suggest (or imply) -- as Borgdorff does -- that the point of practice research is art making, even if the large majority of practice research is just that: art making rendered post hoc as practice research. So much of practice research depends on the questions being asked, the questions that change as they emerge, the ad hoc processs that wax and wane, the deliberate activities that stop being deliberate, and the diverse and mostly non-traditional modes of sharing understanding or insight which are not necessarily concievable as artworks.

What to do? The answer is neither 'make all practice research correspond to making a work of art and then describe its researchfulness post hoc' (which would prevent the development of experimental practices that do not result in artworks) nor 'force practice researchers into some kind of pure ab ovo processes' (which are often troubled by the experience of radical ad hoc-ness and do not coincide with how most practice research is conducted).

The answer is to develop the capacity and sensitivity to recognise the seemingly distinct processes -- what I have called _ab ovo_ and _post hoc_ practice research -- and how they might rather curiously slip over and into each other and even begin to undo the semantic meanings of the terms. Such sensitivity demands tremendous flexibility on the part of the practice researcher; flexibility which also affords the researcher the chance to _stay with the practice_ even while noticing the desire or pressure to narrow the practice's epistemic and ontologic boundaries. The complexity of being caught in quite distinct experiences of process is also a reminder of just how vital is the process of framing practice research. 

But before I turn to an _in process_ example of the nature, messiness and politics of framing practice research, I need to talk about the words that are written as part of practice research. These words are another less obvious part of the split between the academic forum and the forum of the arts. Borgdorff writes simply that "a discursive justification of the research will be necessary with the academic discourse in mind."[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.167] Such discursive justification is what artist-scholar Paul Magee calls the "bifurcated product":[@magee-2012-introduction p.3] the artwork and the writing about the artwork. 

The written component of practice research started out as "getting art on the books"[@magee-2012-introduction p.2] of the academy by attempting to distinguish 'art' from 'artistic research'. But the practice research field struggled with it. Here's Angela Piccini again (see _Introduction_, p.xx), writing online in the northern autumn of 2002:

> Must [practice research] include some form of disseminable reflection? or is the practice in performance sufficient to stand as research output? [Piccini in @thomson-2003-practice p.161]

The disseminable reflection that Piccini refers to is called "complementary writing"[@nelson-2013-practice p.11] by Robin Nelson, and is described as a "research narrative"[@bulley-2021-report p.27] in PRAG's _Pratice Research Report_. But regardless of what it is called, the written component of practice research is now hegemonic in providing something akin to "a single unified answer"[@biggs-2011-communities p.91] in contrast to the "plurality of experiences"[@biggs-2011-communities p.91] and "unfinished thinking"[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.194] of the "provisional"[@schwab-2019-experimental p.166] practice artifact or outcome. The contrasting language of "unified answer" and "unfinished thinking" reflects the divergent epistemic affordances of art practices and writing about art practices.[^thatthing] Nevertheless, the research narrative is as concrete a component of practice research as one can imagine, even if the terms and conditions of its form-content are wildly variable. For instance, most practice research PhDs in the UK require research narratives to be no less than 40000 words. Yet for the Research Excellence Framework, we are only allowed 300 words. There are ways around this limitation, for example adding traditional published articles about the practice in the portfolio for the output. But I for one have grown to like the ways in which the limitation of the 300 words is enough to point to the research within the practice, while enabling the practice to continue to do its own unfinished epistemic work. 

## The nature of the post hoc framing: a case study

How does/might post hoc framing happen? 

In this section I use an artwork as a case study to help understand the written framing -- or research narrative -- of practice research. The artwork is a video called _Children of the Soil_,[@ellis-2022-children] and I use one of my own works because it will help reveal the process of framing more openly, including the half-formed thoughts, assumptions, confabulations, academic games and personal desires. I am less interested in drawing attention to the artwork itself -- it is what it is. This section does not assume a particular form for the eventual written framing[^writingforms] or how to decide on the written form. Rather, it makes it clear that a decision is being made as to what to write about and that the written element happens post hoc -- what I claim is the most common (but not necessarily ideal) form of practice research.

The first time I described _Children of the Soil_ as practice research was on Friday 9 December 2022, nearly four months after it was published online on Vimeo. I described it as such as part of the University's very early review of current research outputs plausibly submittable to the next yet-to-be-announced Research Excellence Framework in the UK. This is not to say I hadn't thought of the work as practice research previously, but only loosely and lightly. You might say that in the back of my mind I was aware that at some stage I would need to articulate its practice research-ness and a University evaluation process precipitated that I cross that line.[^300] 

The conditions for making the video work were an artistic residency in Italy[^nahr] in which the expectation was that I would create art.[^fashion] 

### Overview of the art making process

The process was quintessentially ad hoc. 

- pre pre-production (lots of testing), pre-production, production (making), post-production (making), post post-production

What was the practice or practices? (which might be distinct from what is able to be seen/noticed in the output or outcome of those practices). c.f. those things that are evident in the outcome.  

- timelapses
- falling slowly
- after effects: formal properties and developing that format/form
- observations/listening outside -- each day, regularly. Being outside.
- reading graphic novels (Zerocalcare, Harari)
- writing and collecting: this body
- reading on more-than-human (term coined by David Abram and _The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-Than-Human World_ (New York: Vintage, 1996) -- check this (got this from Bridle) -- but even this is a stretch.

- what are the strands of research dialogue for children of the soil?
	+ graphic novels  
	+ other-than-human  
	+ screendance  
	+ eco-somatics  
	+ temporal experiments in film

These are not abstract entities, constructed by me or others and then introduced for some stated or unstated reason. 

### The chaos of framing (and how to decide)

Implications of the ad hoc nature: for rigour (can be rigorously ad hoc), the nature of the framing, key thing is that is tendrical. Multiple surfaces, many many possibilities to frame as research. 
Serving needs of the profession.

re: post post-production (think of as 'the conditional')
- the choices we make
- telling the truth (timing matters - see Corporeal Epistemics) - rigour, honesty, integrity, transparency
- I could do this.
- I could do this. Which would be more true?  
- What are the reasons for applying one over another? 


The process of framing about understanding which discourses the work most clearly participates in. to discursively communicate its researchfulness and contribution. 

- decision of framing normally (see JAR examples) serves interests of the researcher (call to authority, validation)

“selected, pruned and spruced up” (Richardson, 1994 p.520) (from thesis)

 

Or could add here something about clarity emerging from who the community of practice is (this is a decision). 

- my goal in any kind of research narrative in practice research is to sustain the nature of the artwork (to let it do its own work)
- to point to what is able to be seen/heard in research sense (which might be quite different from what the work is about)





- is it possible to imagine that the less written context required, the more a project can tend towards post hoc? 

- hanging over this are two historical practices as an artist: screendance, and choreography. They are inescapable. When I make timelapses I work with and through the eyes/frames of screendance and choreography. Caught or wrapped in my identity/history/practice. 
- how to separate (or keep together) process and product? 

mention that vimeo thing about practice-research -- and past practices interacting with current ... the diagram dude from RMIT (Richard Blythe -- summary doesn't exist now)

something like this as question underpinning my decision making (include something about not adding adding adding -- validation, calls to authority; also community of practice)


For this scenario I acknowledged the delicate balance of the ecosystem, and my goal was not to introduce any new or unfamiliar species. Indeed, as my eyes, senses and desires (observer effect) adjusted to the particularities of artwork I had made (after I had made it), I started finding new materials and interactions peculiar to the ecosystem. 


### Research bubbles

**Note:** should this be sub-section of 'how to decide'?

a bubble-like version of COTS that references other works that it is not in dialogue with or can never be in dialogue with. Use an example of the bubble and just how common it is. All dead men. Tone is "I could do this." Renders the work inert. Like burying it, or putting it in a coffin with these men. These are different ecosystems. Can I describe without judging? Talk to implications of. Like entering a crowded bar in which no one pays you any attention whatsoever. Can't order a drink. Nothing. No matter how much you tell people "I am here." More akin to gerrymandering


- yes, I add a version of this work in this way -- I do this labour as a thought experiment and to implicate myself (can also given examples of when I've done this previously)
- possible to add discussion about [[art practices explicitly become epistemic things]] -- and the argument I make there about Borgdorff and JAR
- offer to 'write about my practice'; this is what we do in practice-research. the various journals dedicated to practice-research are filled with practitioners in their bubble attempting to convince us of the value of their work. No, not convince us (that would be more palatable), rather, expect us to recognise the value of their work. Noting just how much this diverges from Strand's claim that [[I am a collaboration]] (see backlinks in that note for extended thinking on individuation/individualism)
- see [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]] of epistemic claims. 
- other examples: Freeman book (?), JAR (take random issue), CHOR (of which I'm co-editor). 
- I'm guilty. 
- perhaps more guilty given the unsurprising focus of dance practices on the body. I've even started calling them body-based practices as my curiosity has stretched away from codified dance practices (including improvisation). -- extracted most of my notes on this to [[the body in artistic research]] but I wonder if it can be included very briefly. That pull is strong.
- Noting that it's _easier_ to find theoretical work to be in relation with. It's there. It's desk work. It's more tangible (which is ironic given body in performance work?)
- more like a foreign body dropping into a pre-existing ecosystem; isolated; argument from authority; these are singular systems (Steyerl).

- compare with Schwab in describing a piece of knowledge as an artefact of communication: [[experimentation is social#^da953d]] - so if this is plausible, who then is doing the communicating? (if it isn't artist-researchers)
- perhaps though Schwab's concern for how artworks are provisional ([[schwab - experimental systems#^279252]]) (ie epistemic things filled with epistemic potential) is fundamental to the expositions in JAR as being starting points or seeds. But where does that leave us? Scattering seeds everywhere (seeds dependent on theory-as-water).
- "What I’m objecting to is the use of names as talismans." [Chamberlain, in @thomson-2003-practice p.176] - referring to Kant. I think I have same objection.

- but what of a work 'about' something? Borgdorff touches on this -- (when I searched for 'articulation' in the book) -- about conceptual/theoretical (perhaps also the quote on the canvas? -- from p.151). But this is where the principle of reaching out and then back becomes important: Can go out to theory but Must articulate back to community. Else just a series of singular events. No reciprocity. [[Weber - Enlivenment#^f00e6f]]

Noting "focuses on their practice" from SW's original invitation -- just take a sample, perhaps there will be exceptions that prove the rule. But this is the unspoken practice: that when we write about artistic practice we don't write about how it is part of an ecosystem ([[difference between ecology and ecosystem]]) of practice. We tend to write about it as part of alternative ecosystems (ones that are not at all aware that the practice exists and nor would they care). It fails to be in dialogue. Not surprising in a nascent form in the academy we'd choose to be in relation to authorities (philosophical, cultural). We lean on them to prop up the status of our work. This is as old (or young) as PaR -- remember conversations from PARIP in 2003. Perhaps though this is a matter of choice: the connections we choose to make. Why then would we choose these other ecosystems? What does it say about us? 

Curious that for all the word's utility in performance writing, in practice-research we exist in bubbles: these are ecosystems of theory, with borders and boundaries constructed by authors to validate an artistic practice.

Curious also re [[a claim to specificity clashes with a claim to singularity]] and [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]]. Steyerl writes how practices of artistic research "usually partake in both registers". Usually? Note in that blog post on Steyerl I discuss 'at least 3 ways' artists are in relationship with others -- but they are a mess and need clarification (they might have made sense at the time but not now)

### The most basic (and moral) of research intentions

In 2002 the theatre scholar Melissa Trimingham expressed frustration at the lack of a clearly articulated methodology for practice-research, and the indifference of artist-scholars towards the "need to communicate and disseminate research findings" [@trimingham-2002-methodology p.54]. In just the third paragraph of the article, Trimingham makes a bold and important claim: 

> We cannot afford to dispense with the most basic (and moral) of research intentions: put simply, it must be for the benefit of others apart from the researchers themselves.[@trimingham-2002-methodology p.54]

- is Trimingham's statement different from the ecosystem/bubble I am hinting at? My hunch is that the bubble is a sub-set of her thinking.

go into some detail with the statement. Why moral? What about the word _benefit_? Like it's some kind of litmus test. Do I go into implications of it not being true? Who would disagree with it? (which is not to say it's complex to find examples that are exceptions)

For the purposes of this writing I will take Trimingham's statement as axiomatic: that re

Whether you agree with it or not, . A way to draw attention our responsibilities as practice-researchers (use of that pronoun indicates my audience), which are really no different from the responsibilities of researchers in other disciplines even if the epistemic and ontologic conditions of the work we do are starkly different. 


## Ecosystems

> Life can never be just a resource; it is always also a gift received by the other members of the ecosystem whose contributions are necessary for a living subject to survive.[@weber-2019-enlivenment p.45] 

To help understand the implications of Trimingham's assertion for current practice-researchers, I am going to adopt what I suspect is a rather fashionable metaphor. 

At present, describing anything as an ecosystem holds currency in the arts and humanities. For instance, in academic writing in dance and performance[^global] the word _ecosystem_ gets used loosely and broadly, including as an unspecified place human beings live in or inhabit [e.g. @moradian-2021-human; @vicente-2022-turning], as a place akin to nature or the natural [e.g. @sebianeserrano-2020-mestizo], as a entity that needs saving [e.g. @laidlaw-2021-ecological], as a thing to be aware of [e.g. @weig-2021-novel], as a way to understand the body [e.g. @nuding-2021-approaching], as places to encounter [e.g. @mchugh-2021-embodying], and as a metaphor [e.g. @parkinson-2010-art].

An ecosystem is, in fact, a "biological system composed of all the organisms found in a particular physical environment, interacting with it and with each other" [@dictionary-2022-ecosystem n.pag.]. I would like to draw attention to three words from this definition: _particular_, _found_, and _interacting_.

The common example of an ecosystem is a pond with its ... How one delineates a pond from the rest of its environment is, in effect, a choice. Should the stones around the outside be included? What about the ground on the outside of those stones? You might call it biological gerrymandering. When we use the word ecosystem -- in its literal or metaphorical sense -- we are describing a _particular_ environment and that particularity needs to be specified. Add Hannah Close's thinking on [[a system has boundaries]] - similar to gerrymandering, but also questioning the word 'system'.

Also Steyerl on bubbles: [[Steyerl on specificity and singularity]] -- reminded of word sui generis.

The same goes with what is found and the kinds of interactions we might notice. What is found depends on the eyes and technologies we deploy. What are we hoping to see, what are we willing to see, what kinds of attention we are willing to pay. Mention how perspective changes based on who is looking? = Observer effect (distinct from uncertainty principle). How things are in relationship to each other, how they interact and change, modify, adapt each other. How they move and are moved by other aspects or organisms in the ecosystem.

A way to mark our understanding, or even the limitations of our perspectives.



- perhaps inherent is not the right word -- both scenarios are constructions. If not 'inherent' and 'invasive' then what? I suspect they are still useful -- but it's a different question from what is there? And what if one of the practices was reading 'philosophy', does that make it inherent (akin to reading graphic novels)?

## analysis - why this matters (contribution) -

- note down when I was reading these and _when_ they contributed

Ben Rawlence is ... and his book _Treeline_ traces the 

> If who you are is one creature embedded in an ecosystem along with many others, then healing means restoring you to that inherited role ... [@rawlence-2022-treeline p.215] 

[[Rawlence - The Treeline#^1445bb]]

> We can’t manage an ecosystem! What hubris to think human beings can enter into millions of interconnected, complicated, refluxing, pricking, stinging, collaborating relationships, and manage it. [@ducann-2022-my n.pag.] - this could be the epigraph. That we are managing and it doesn't work.

This Strand quote is from [[collapse is generative]]

The distinction between Rawlence's thinking and Strand's is that Rawlence is discussing being aware of our place in an ecosystem, whereas Strand is talking about the hubris of attempting to control an ecosystem. Perhaps use of word reciprocity or enlivenment is better? (see <https://dark-mountain.net/the-poetics-of-ecology/>)

> Ecology teaches us that we exist by virtue of our ties to one another and to the more-than-human world, and that those ties are strengthened, not weakened, by the inclusion and equal participation of each and every member of that network. The strength and resilience of computational networks, the inherent power of distribution and interconnection, teaches us the same.[@bridle-2022-ways n.pag.]

> When you narrow down your epistemology and act on the premise “What interests me is me, or my organization, or my species,” you chop off consideration of other loops of the loop structure. (from Bateson, cited in Bridle blog post above)
- the difference though (talking about Bateson's eco-mental) is that the artist-scholar in this circumstance remains untouched by their plea to a particular ecosystem of thought and ideas. Or is it that they get but don't give. They gain warrant, validation, an argument from authority. Or perhaps it's simply extractive. What I can get from this validation.


> Against this background, the negotiations of sense at the interfaces of arts and academia—in Henk Borgdorff’s (2010) terms, “boundary work”—concern also the registers of sense and the questions of whether, how, and why some of them are prioritised over others. [@elo-2018-ineffable p.282]
- I include this quote here as perhaps something to consider when I discuss ecosystem edges and why we prioritise singular (in Steyerl's term) over dialogue

- also [@schindler-2020-negotiation] on boundary objects in practice-research (based on work of Star and Griesemer) -- it might be possible for me to argue that artistic-researchers use theory/text as a boundary object (texts constructed by others, and not as part of collaborations) -- it's a stretch though and certainly not at all close to what Star and Griesemer are talking about.

> Children of the Soil is a short film that explores the slow work of growth, gravity and decay. It was created through several practices: 1) falling slowly to the ground; 2) timelapse photography; 3) post-production explorations of spatialising time (using graphic novel 'panels'); 4) texts exploring the more-than-human world (Abram, 1996). I was relatively new to all of these practices before pre-production, although the body-based work is a natural extension of my ongoing corporeal practice. The four practices coalesce around two artistic contexts that I have worked in for 20-30 years: choreography and screendance. I don't yet know how to write about it as research and for which community of practice. I am currently clarifying these issues in a journal article but am tending to think of it as research in and for the screendance community (albeit in an experimental way) that aims to question the role and presence of the human body without simply rendering it invisible.

[^harford]: The entire premise of the public assessment of research is for a panel of peers to do its best to assess the quality of research; by which I am encouraged to infer that some artistic practices (or at least how they are presented for REF in this case) must be more researchful than others. In many respects, it is inevitable that a process like REF will change the behaviours of those it involves. "The trouble is that when we start quantifying and measuring everything, we soon begin to change the world to fit the way we measure it."[@harford-2016-messy n.pag.] I don't want to get into this -- it's another article about the nature of quantification and measurement and how they shape practices and processes. I also don't want to get into it because I think the way practice research has 'shaped itself' is more fundamental to the shift from professional contexts to academic contexts (of the professionalization of the academy). Is 'better art' made as a consequence of practice research? if the answer is 'no' then what the fuck are we doing? 

[^maybe]: Come to think of it -- this might have been one of the ones the REF panel was referring to! foot note re possible exception based on REF feedback (Dad: it's not about you) <https://uoa33.coventry.domains/corporeal-epistemics/> ; and b) and Corporeal Epistemics[@ellis-2020-corporeal] for REF2021 -- an essay presented as an experimental desktop documentary. Even in this it was not clear whether the work should be framed as practice research or merely submitted as a 'non-traditional' format.

- purpose is not to provide a written (extrinsic) account of the process or outcomes. To use it to dig into the various ways I might approach its context. Not quite right -- because some of the [[list of possible contexts for children of the soil]] would likely end as post-hoc (extrinsic) renderings
- lines are blurry -- slippage between 'output' and 'context' (very common in JAR and perhaps JER?) -- or what the PRAG report terms the 'practice' and the 'narrative'?

These are conceived and developed as _making art_ and then reframed as practice research to serve. This might be called retrofitting but it also might be a necessary reflecting on an (ad hoc) artistic practice/project and attempting to discursively communicate its researchfulness and contribution. Post hoc refers to when this work occurs and I think it means anything other than ab ovo. Might be collection of activities, processes, awarenesses, writings. Might be done in one go. 

Trimingham's response was to propose a broad methodology built on hermeneutics, social science methods, and action research (mention hermeneutic spiral). bold and called for a practice-research methodology that could "account for the disorderly creative process and yet demonstrate rigorous planning" [@trimingham-2002-methodology p.55]. 

some 20 years later -- I think it would be perceived as a conservative approach (I wonder to what extent it would be perceived) to the methodological concerns of practice-research. My purpose here is not to get into the pros and cons of Trimingham's proposal, and nor do I wish to dig into how well it was aged (although I think that would be a useful reflection). My intuition is that we have moved further away from calls for clarity and rigour even compared with the wild west days of practice-research in the late 90s and early 2000s. Rather, I want to focus on the epigraph above which comes from just the third

Note also that Borgdorff's thinking re art serving both art community and academic one. p.167. Opens clear possibility of work 'about' something that still functions in both communities -- but HOW it functions in academic community of practice needs to be articulated? 

(thought of it as an artwork -- akin to B p.154) 

> We can justifiably speak of [practice research] ... when that artistic practice is not only the result of the research, but also its methodological vehicle, when the research unfolds in and through the acts of creating and performing. This is a distinguishing feature of this research type within the whole of academic research.

-- Henk Borgdorff[-@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.147]

What I am not sure is clear from Borgdorff's categorisation of research _in_ the arts is how artists (including practice researchers) often talk about practices that lead to an artistic work _about_ something. For example, I could develop an artistic work through specific body-based practices (say using authentic movement, improvisation and movement meditations) that is also about something seemingly external to those practices; for instance, eco-anxiety and the climate emergency. How does such a work contribute to a disciplinary field (in this case eco-psychology) that is marginally related if at all to the practices in the research? This distinction between practice research in the arts, and practice research leading to a work about something nominally (or utterly) outside of the field of the practice will become clearer later when I talk about ...

> The University of Melbourne’s preference was that I submit the thesis prior to, or at the very latest, six weeks after the completion of the live work. This was problematic for me as, in simple terms, it represented a way of viewing the performance work as being illustrative of theoretical and/or written concepts, and in so doing, foregrounded foundationalist and logocentric epistemological attitudes.[@ellis-2005-indelible p.36]

history of the document in practice research is an escape clause to distinguish 'art' from 'artistic research'(Magee, Borgdorff?, Thomson?) By enforcing a written component, it neuters

How are such post hoc declarations different from early premise (not sure how much it stands now) in practice research which was to make a work of art then write about it (my PhD attempted to subvert that). Nelson?

## words words words: making an artwork and then writing about it

### Intrinsic-extrinsic epistemic continuum

Piccini's question reflects two divergent epistemic positions in practice research: 1) artistic artefacts require a written reflective or analytical statement that synthesises and reveals the epistemic status or findings of the research [e.g. @nelson-2013-practice; @noauthor-2019-ref2021]; 2) artistic artefacts themselves contain and communicate research understandings, including apprehension, experience (etc) [@borgdorff-2012-conflict], [@scrivener-2002-art]

- intrinsic very rare. REF is close. JAR nope. The default position tends towards extrinsic. JER tends towards intrinsic -- but with video document as proxy (with text component)


Both positions have inherent problems.

- maybe these are not necessarily only epistemic positions. That is, what if can 'hope' for intrinsic epistemics, but explicitly extrinsic in how it participates in the world/community of practice?-- this is what Borgdorff hints at on p.154 (note 10)

The extrinsic position -- that knowledge in practice-research is revealed or clarified through written forms -- sets no margins or limits on the epistemic claims that artistic-scholars make on behalf of their practices, and such claims are rarely "made available for sustained and verifiable peer review" [@haseman-2007-tightrope n.pag.].

This is where getting outside of the bubble is key. It helps to corral epistemic laxity. It generates connection. 

The intrinsic position -- that knowledge is intrinsic to artistic-research artefacts -- is dominated by vagueness and ambiguity. These attributes -- vagueness and ambiguity -- are viewed as strengths and/or weaknesses. The intrinsic position is particularly vulnerable to the development of epistemic proxies that stand in for the epistemic complexity, nuances and possibilities of practice-research. For example, An epistemic proxy does not address the epistemic complexity and limitations of practice-research, and keeps genuine changes in understanding at arm's length. Add point here about documentation being the critical proxy in practice-research This is because "proxies are easier to manipulate than the complicated reality they represent" [@oneil-2016-weapons Chapter 3]. Could speak of maps and territories here.

- noting that cohesion does not necessarily mean precise. Often, cohesion is marked by vagueness (see JAR examples) - [[valorising vagueness]]. That's a strange dance that one. To deploy language of uncertainty while being validated by authority. re Machine of academy above: paradox of this is that we deploy slippery 'maybe' language -- but this bug not feature. The key problem is there is no ecosystem or commons (Weber Enlivenment): [[Weber - Enlivenment#^5704ea]]

... other positions are often inadvertently supported in journals devoted to practice-research. e.g. the writing refers to the ambiguity and letting the work do the work. More common is simply to describe a research process (see JAR V20 - and lift any number of quotes from reflections on JAR -- perhaps that is about vagueness now.


But the buck does not stop there. We write about it.

- how the artistic work (or practice, process, artifacts, or aspects of it), connects with and serves the research community (through being framed as practice research)
- for all that unfinished thinking, the question of writing re practice research has well and truly been answered, if  not the quantity of words. 

Practice researchers might be accused of 'academising' artistic work but for the most part o

Even if the professionalisation of the arts has increased the overlap between the professional and academic artistic communities, [**citation**] the distinction remains tangible. 

In contrast, for the , the epistemic nature of the artistic work is fundamental. Borgdorff writes that in the context of practice research "artworks are the generators of that which we do not yet know. They thereby invite us to think. [Practice] research is the articulation of this unfinished thinking."[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.194] What kind of articulation is Borgdorff describing here? (mention how it ties into writing??)

- how does B's 'unfinished thinking' make sense re intrinsic vs extrinsic? Does that mean text serves to finish the thinking? idea of joke not being ruined by explanation. (a case for writing)

- writen about this in that thing produced -- small quote (working with Magee?)


Such a situation is far from common, and it is where post hoc framing is best replaced by research questions and articulations that are as in direct dialogue as possible with the nature of the practice itself. That is, 

But, it's a useful enough simplification, not least because large percentage (what percentage?) of practice research ends up as artworks.


But what of those situations in which an artwork is not made after a long (or short) period of artistic practice? 

This bifurcation is both pragamatic and epistemic. It is pragmatic in how it recognises the different audiences for artistic work and artistic-work-framed-as-practice-research. It is epistemic in how the two paths distinctly confront the nature of coming-to-know.

- note how [[object, process and context in practice-research]], [[art practice and artistic research]] (see "unfolds") and [[borgdorff - debate on research in the arts]] might be useful. 

and that it is "fruitful"[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.8] in practice research to distinguish between object, process and context, in which _object_ is the work of art, _process_ is the making of art, and _context_ is the art world. 

is post-hoc different from reflective (or refractive if you want to go there). Old story that one -- e.g. Eisner? Or who was the education person? Schon! (reflective practitioner) I think it is distinct from merely reflecting on the work. 

> and that he'd forgotten the slow doing by which [Mette Edvardsen] had arrived – a slow doing she describes as being 'the dust that accumulates through the working'.

use the word "pure" for ab ovo? That in reality dealing with huge range of diverse ad hoc processes (artistic methods) with as many distinct practices (which might be able to be broadly categorised in an unhelpful way)

> Chrysa Parkinson, whose work has focused particularly on practice, read what I'd written and wrote in the margin that she agreed practice is not an art object, but that nevertheless you art when you practice. She said, 'It's something about how the materials you practise with start to teach you. It's not just you digging, it's the soil getting dug. It's the trowel or shovel talking back to your hand. Smell of the soil. Maybe the soil is urgent. You do the allotment every day because otherwise something will die, or not grow, or grow too much.'[@burrows-2022-writing p.24]

> Consequently, guiding intuitions and chance inspirations are just as important for the motivation and dynamism of research as methodological prescriptions and discursive justifications.[@borgdorff-2012-conflict p.162]

The first is the glaring and quite possibly faulty assumption that by describing "work that was created with other agendas or purposes in mind"[@noauthor-2022-overview p.193] the REF panel was referring to art made as art that was then retrofitted as practice research, and that such retrofitting _should not_ happen. 

Such a methodological necessity would imply that one of the roles of REF panel D is to act as arbiters of the quality of retrofitting in practice research.

> fiction: "something made, not something false." -- Wallace Martin [-@martin-1986-recent p.22]

> one species of the genus 'fiction,' the latter word originally having meant something made, not something false.

What if the panel _wanted_ to suggest not all art could or should be retrofitted as practice research, but ended up implying that some REF outputs disguised their _retrofitting_ better than others? 

That part of the mangle of practice is its ad hoc-ness. (see note 34 on p.21 of Pickering - Suchman). Also Pickering on mental hygiene (and Popper etc) on p.198 -- fantastic. This is a 'thing' for science to admit, but less so in the arts. is the mangle of practice self-evident? the ad hoc-ness of messy process? "self-evident" - Burrows (15 Dec 2022, personal comms)

> And without too much preparation on the spur of the moment I shared the thought 'practice is a doing which is not yet art', but the exact meaning of what I intended to say only vaguely hovered, clouded with questions.[@burrows-2022-writing p.23]

am I making teleology based argument here? that ad hoc nature of artistic practice renders ab ovo a bit useless? (Was it Bridle who mentioend something like this?) 

Invites old question of whether some art making is not researchful and that the REF panelists were seeing that work with its retrofitted RQs etc. Because, surely some artwork is not as research-ful as others? And that some of that researchfulness is better than others (how ever one might understand 'better' -- more original? more significant? more rigorous??) Isn't that the premise of REF processes? 

**need to clarify this assumption and its value**. If this assumption is incorrect, then my decision to use the panel's feedback as a catalyst for this writing was poor, but it does not change the potential value of the writing to practice researchers. (have this sentence as footnote?). In this writing, I use the REF2021 panel's statement as a catalyst to understand and articulate _when_ practice research occurs. To do this I enter the mangle of practice. My concern is not to critique the statement or get mired in conjecture. **like a provocation.**

The word in the REF2021 feedback that is perhaps most telling is the word _appeared_. What did the panelists see and read that led them to think or feel that? Does it means some practice researchers are more capable of disguising post hoc declarations of practice research? 

It is self-evident to say that for any practice research project, the practice researcher will possess varying degrees of experience of practice research, including potentially having completed ab ovo practice research. Therefore, there are degrees to which an artist working as part of the academy can be experienced in practice research (or not) and be aware that their artistic work will be framed post hoc as practice research (or not).

Experience of practice research
Awareness of post hoc framing

**experienced-aware:** The artist-scholar is an experienced practice researcher, perhaps having completed an ab ovo practice research PhD.[^publication]. They are also aware their project will be framed as practice research.

**experienced-unaware:** The artwork is developed and completed by an experienced practice researcher without them being aware the work will at some stage be framed as practice research. 

**naïve-aware:** The artist knows their project will be framed as practice research post hoc but has little to no experience of practice research from the inside out. 

**naïve-unaware:** The artist is little or no experience of practice research and is not aware their artwork will later be framed as practice research

My hunch is that _naive-aware_ remains the most common scenario in UK higher education institutions. Regardless, 

But outside of doctorates and to a lesser extent MA-level projects, I am aware of few if any practice research projects which have been planned and conceived as such from the beginning. Certainly outside of academic funding streams. Even ab ovo enter ad hoc-ness -- that is, ab ovo does not exclude ad hoc. 

(most likely their PhD - but not necessarily if by publication): they understand its pitfalls, contexts, framings, principles, maybe even the codes. It’s the been-there-done-that version of post hoc PaR.

but is not aware of PaR from the inside-out. I suspect this is very common indeed and I’ve noticed it in institutions all over the UK. You have an artist in the University who is asked to “do research”. The artist is told, “you’re an artist, you can submit practice as a research output for the Research Excellence Framework”, or “Your artistic work is REFable”. The danger here is that it can lead to confusion: “But I was told I could do practice”. In effect, institutions are wanting artists to understand an entire history (recent as it is), practices, and methods of PaR in order to frame their artistic practices as research. The success or failure of this scenario is often dependent on the type of practice the artist has.

Important too, because there’s an argument that perhaps knowing something is research (or that it will be reframed as such) might get in the way of the art-making. Very dependent on individuals.

that is, for any particular research and/or artistic activity, when is a particular output first thought of, described and/or disseminated as practice research? Discuss problem of term 'output' for me -- it's not an outcome and yet it might be (in practice research terms). It's in the linear input-output thing that it's entirely inappropriate. Better word? 

As I write this section it's early November 2022 and I am standing at the work table of an apartment that belongs to some friends. The table is busier than I would normally work at -- a consequence of a nomadic existence at present. Here's a photograph of the things on the surface of the table; some of them belong to me, others belong to my friends. All of these things have been added to or placed on the table. 

[insert photograph, Simon Ellis, 2 November 2022]

I am going to call the surface of this work table an ecosystem, 

and I do this to keep the potential value of this writing clear, but also in the spirit of the somewhat arbitrary nature of biological systems. It's also useful because a table is not unlike an island, and islands are very useful places on which to study interactions between organisms [@wardle-2002-islands]. 

I have deployed the metaphor of the table-as-ecosystem to playfully and clearly communicate the particularities and interactions of the ecosystem, and what might be found in it -- or introduced to it -- depending on how we look and what we want to see. It is certainly possible that the two trajectories might overlap _in the real world_, but for the sake of clarity I attempt to keep them as distinct as possible.  

this guy mentions post hoc: https://artistsresearchcentre.org.uk/research/writing-what-is-artistic-research/

I understand the question 'When do artistic projects become practice research?' to be quite difference from the question inferred by Piccini above; that is 'What is the difference between practice that is research and practice that is not?' The first question of 'when' exists under very diff is operating under specific conditions -- conditions of the academy. Conditions in which claims to 'researchfulness' are made; that there is pressure to make such claims. 

What is different from 2003 is that practice research is more established in the academy, at least in the UK. 

The presence of practice research in art departments and research centres in the academy means that artists in the academy are, ipso facto, doing research (that whatever it is that we do, there is spoken and unspoken pressure on us to call it research). That is, the professionalisation of the arts in universities led to the development of practice research. Much of the more difficult aspects of practice research's history (epistemic, ontologic, what else?) could be traced back to that tail-wagging-dog starting point.  

because the key ideological project of practice-research has been to get art “on the books as research”[@magee-2012-introduction n.pag.] - Magee covers the above situation beautifully. Also my work in That Thing Produced

Today, though, practice research is clearly established in arts institutions in the academy, at least in the UK, Scandanavia, Australia and New Zealand (Canada?). The problem with that troubled history is that, like all history, it is easy to forget. It is easy to forget that my doing art-making as research in the academy is the result of mostly economic and political forces during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bologna. Earlier elsewhere -- see Magee. It is not even something to forget for newer artist-scholars who entered arts departments in Universities after, say, 2010 and practice research was, well, just there. It was there for them as MA-level students, even for BA-level students, and it was certainly there for them as PhD students with funded studentships. All that there is to remember for these (mostly) younger artists is there exists a place in which one can pursue artistic practice that is/was research.  

To start with, I need to set out some clear categories under which (or by which) I suspect all practice-research projects exist (invite falsifiability here). These categories -- or perhaps conditions -- exist in different contexts and different situations for artist-researchers. I'll make these different conditions clear as I write them.

Whereas research _on_ the arts is clearly distinct from the other two, it is plausible to imagine a project that contains both research _for_ and _in_ the arts (that is if I've understood Borgdorff's instrumental perspective correctly). For instance, research exploring explicitly hybrid movement practices might contribute to conversations around methods of creation, while also unfolding through creative acts. Nevertheless, in this writing my focus will be on research _in_ the arts as it most closely aligns with the common understanding of practice research. I also want to delimit and clarify as precisely as possible the conditions of the exemplar project. 

Research _on_ the arts has art practice as the _object_ of the research. Borgdorff calls this the "interpretative perspective"[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.6] in which the object is "untouched"[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.6] by the researcher. Research _for_ the arts is an _applied_ form of research where art is "not so much the object of investigation, but its objective."[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.6] It is an "instrumental perspective,"[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.6] that produces "the tools and the knowledge of materials"[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.6] that are needed by artists. Research _in_ the arts "does not observe a distance between the researcher and the practice of art":[@borgdorff-2006-debate p.7] 

Borgdorff also distinguishes between different kinds of art research as research _on_ the arts, research _for_ the arts, and research _in_ the arts.[@borgdorff-2006-debate][^cate] 

- make further distinction between research in and that other (un-named?) version in which the artistic practice is trying to do something in effectively another field -- philosophy, psychology, geography, digital humanities ... (related to 'making a work about something')
- useful (in comments too): https://practiceasresearchblog.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/smelling-as-sweet/
- I am not suggesting that there is nothing to gain from applying arts practices in and to other fields. Indeed, I am deeply curious about such applications -- their limits and possibilities. 


Further, whereas Borgdorff writes _artistic research_ I will use the term _practice research_ because it is the adopted convention in the UK where I am writing.[@bulley-2021-report] 

has been called many things: practice-as-research, practice research (with and without a hyphen), practice-led research, practice-based research, artistic research, practice on the arts, creative research. But no matter its name, In _The Conflict of the Faculties: Perspectives on Artistic Research and Academia_ (2012) 

The UK's Practice Research Advisory Group commissioned two reports on practice research. The first is called _What is Practice Research?_ and in it the authors James Bulley and Özden Şahin describe how practice research differs from ‘traditional’ research fields because "the practice itself is foregrounded as the significant method of a research output"[@bulley-2021-report p.4]. Bulley and Şahin seem to be mirroring This seems similar to Borgdorff's Note that this. Also not as far as Nelson. Perhaps it is implicit (or assumed) in their definition. But can we justifiably do practice research in which the practice is not part of the output? Perhaps I'm reading this wrong -- but it's a mess.

resaerch on, for, in: Add Scrivener's version? - "Transformational Practice: On The Place Of Material Novelty In Artistic Change", Chapter 15 of Biggs and Karlsson (Routledge Companion to Research in the Arts) -- he's very clear (as ever)

Frayling's prepositions are a little more confusing, particularly  research "for" art -- which he describes as little r research[@frayling-1993-research p.5]

in much practice-research, there has been a sharp rise in scholarship using the ill-defined term _embodied knowledge_ (and its cousin _tacit knowledge_) as a concept to describe the epistemic value of that research.[^ek1] Artist-scholars who research through movement practices have valorised and reified the concept of embodied knowledge; as if to say, the body knows and _ipso facto_ practice-research generates knowledge. 

If it is "the search for truth that underpins research" [@ingold-2018-search] then, even under the conditions in which "truth is aspirational", [@ingold-2018-search] practice-research's relaxed attitude towards the truth is a serious problem. Hence, the diverse range of outcomes artist-scholars state as research _findings_ are often at best conceived _a priori_, or at worst simply made up.

## Two surprising things in the table as ecosystem

I am making this up. This is a confabulation. 

While I was clearing the table of the stuff that did not belong to it I discovered -- or _found_ -- two surprising things. First was a small piece of graffiti-like text, etched into the table, that said: _it must be for the benefit of others_. Second, I found a video artwork embedded into the surface of the table. 

These discoveries mean that in this simple table-as-ecosystem we have: i) a challenge for practice-researchers published on paper in 2002 by Melissa Trimingham, and then introduced by force into the table sometime between then and the end of 2022; and ii) a video artwork presented as practice-research which is called _Children of the Soil_ [-@ellis-2022-children], and that must have been introduced to the table in the latter part of 2022.  include def of native here. Neither the video nor the text made it onto this table by themselves and so we cannot call them native.

My discovery (construction) of this rather curious ecosystem affords two hypothetical trajectories or scenarios. I will use these scenarios to explore how the video work can act as a proxy for all practice-research, and how the work interacts with the etching: _it must be for the benefit of others_. 

Both scenarios describe approaches to **making sense of this table as ecosystem** [this isn't right - not about making sense of table as ecosystem but how I use the table as ecosystem to communicate the work], and in particular attitudes to how we understand the particularities, interactions of the ecosystem, and what might be found -- or introduced -- depending on how we look. 

an example of COTS in dialogue (see below re graphic novels, non-human, etc) -- it would have to be absurdly brief but I could also show more detail in some kind of diagram. Earlier question: Is it worth -- re Children of the Soil -- to do a very brief mapping of who/how it is in relation to other practices? 
The distinction is that for one of the 2 versions above I am already a part of an ecosystem. The other is an abstraction.

understanding and illustrating Two things I could do. This artwork is COTS. What the work is is not so important -- these scenarios exist for all art that is presented through practice-research. 

Let's say that the artistic work and the piece of graffiti were introduced (by humans) into this ecosystem at an unknown time.

What is inherent or native to the work and what might I choose to add to this ecosystem? (contrast native vs introduced -- what's that word?) 

So now things are clear. We have a basic and moral research intention proposed by Melissa Trimingham -- a part of which is etched into the work table -- and a video artwork,  

but they are also a part of the work table's ecosystem -- like the grain, density and colour of the wood, the glue holding the planks together, and the surface's wear and tear.

So, we have an artistic work and a piece of graffiti that are part of the table's ecosystem. 

The Finnish Nigerian journalist Minna Salami's speaks of the value in having an image to hang an idea from; that images are "really good for explaining and bringing people on board" [@lawson-2022-other pp.151-152]. 

So now things are clear. We have a basic and moral research intention proposed by Melissa Trimingham -- a part of which is etched into the work table -- and a video artwork,  

but they are also a part of the work table's ecosystem -- like the grain, density and colour of the wood, the glue holding the planks together, and the surface's wear and tear.

So, we have an artistic work and a piece of graffiti that are part of the table's ecosystem. 

Please suspend your disbelief. 

What is inherent to the table? -- certainly the histories, citations of Trimingham. What if I place an artistic work of mine on this table? What is inherent? Interacting.

Think of it as an empty space on which to place things, and of the things that place themselves on it after my choices.

The desk I am working on -- do I include the trestles holding it up? What then of the floor on this first floor? And the structures holding up that floor. And the organisms working away in the wood of the table top? None relevant to this writing except to say they might have some effect on how I perceive myself in this ecosystem. Image of table -- or desktop. Importance of choice.

- Perhaps where we choose to delineate ecosystems is just that: a choice (like gerrymandering). A way to mark our understanding, or even the limitations of our perspectives. Perhaps not so far from [[a border is not a boundary]]
- see here for comparison with biome, biosphere and ecosystem: <https://socratic.org/questions/what-is-the-relationship-between-the-biosphere-a-biome-and-an-ecosystem> -- note point about "given environment." and also biotic and abiotic aspects of an ecosystem.

Also in extended use: a complex system resembling this" [@dictionary-2022-ecosystem n.pag.].

The thing about the word _ecosystem_ is that it can be used quite fluidly. Gerrymandering. 

Example from 1935 (from OED):

> A. G. Tansley in _Ecology_ **16** 306 The fundamental concept appropriate to the biome considered together with all the effective inorganic factors of its environment is the _ecosystem_, which is a particular category among the physical systems that make up the universe.

I'm going to deploy it as a metaphor; not least because of its currency in writings about climate emergency. 

Resist writing about a work of mine even though the invitation was to "focus on my practice." I'd rather let the practice do its own work. There are too many words written about the practices of artists, especially by the artists themselves.

### word searches 'ecosystem'

_Dance research_: just 1 article: 'Site, Adapt, Perform: A Practice-as-Research Confrontation with Climate Change' by Melanie Kloetzel (2017) - practice-research (not surprising)

_CHOR_: 7 articles (including one of my editorials)

_PR_:  82 articles in Performance Research

_JDSP_: 

- 14 articles:
- Moradian: ecosystem as something we live in (ie external to us); lip service to it really [@moradian-2021-human p.13] (also mentions exteroception -- just as a note here) -- this is common and something that Latour describes as deanimating the Earth and thereby robbing it of agency (through science objectifying the planet) -- see Kloetzel for this reference to Latour [@kloetzel-2017-site pp.121-122]
- Vicente: ecosystem as place to inhabit - "as if by changing my body I was at the same time changing the ecosystem in which it is grounded" (p.81); also equating to 'natural world' (p.84) in the sense of reducing distant between spectator and 'global ecosystem' (which is a good thing) [@vicente-2022-turning p.84]
- both these two (Moradian and Vicente) are drawing on that difficult thing of the body as subject and object (like interoception) that Leder discusses in Chapter 17 of The Interoceptive Mind ([[the lived body and embodiment]]); like we have to separate ourselves to talk about the body (ourselves) -- is this a discrete problem from, say, autoethnography?
- Laidlaw: role of humans "within the ecosystem" (human as guardian/saviour of that which we separate ourselves through language); [@laidlaw-2021-ecological p.105]
- Weig: use of word ecosystemic; metaphor of fascia in body (body first body first body first!) - "ways of shaping community, honouring human ecosystemic nestedness, and coming to appreciate Earth as co-guider in eco-somatic practices" [@weig-2021-novel p.55]; describes more-than-human ecosystemic aliveness (p.56). Focus in general in this article on ecosystemic awareness. The article is perhaps an example of trying to speak of more than human or of not separating ourselves from *the* ecosystem. Perhaps use of definite article is useful/intriguing? 
- Bettmann: article about eco-somatics; one use of word 'ecosystem' deployed as "her ecosystem" -- sense of belonging (not separate); [@bettmann-2021-public p.43]
- Kampe et al: editorial for volume on eco-consciouness (that most of above are part of). They say "embodied eco-consciousness" which in itself speaks volumes about body body body. [@kampe-2021-embodying]
- Nuding takes ecosystems into the body (microbial) -- adopts critical framing of eco-somatics (p.34). "Instead of cultivating embodied understandings of entanglement, does it not risk reinforcing concepts of nature as something ‘out there’, as an exoticized other to be appropriated for human experience?" [@nuding-2021-approaching p.34]:

> However, the reconfiguration of human/nature and nature/culture has relevance far beyond disciplines and discourse directly concerned with landscape; these binary constructions are inherent aspects of what Stein calls ‘the modern-colonial habit-of-being’, which ‘rests first and foremost on a foundational separation of humans from each other and the rest of nature (other-than-human beings)’(2019: 199).[@nuding-2021-approaching p.35]

- Kussmaul and Longley -- mention of permeability of ecosystems (at end, p.151) -- more sensitive; less like "out there" [@nuding-2021-approaching p.34] which seems more common; mention of fascia (but haven't yet looked into overlaps with Weig?); critiques inside/outside binary [@kussmaul-2021-queer p.151]
- McHugh on embodying nature: "Eco-consciousness has its foundation in an active relationship between the individual soma and the larger body of the natural world" [@mchugh-2021-embodying p.125]. Makes me think we can't avoid that me/it discrepancy. But this statement makes it about a question of scale and that's just too simplistic. And also as if we are somehow unnatural; describes (more specifically than others) ecosystems: "encounters with available ecosystems such as ocean, woods, rivers and meadows" [@mchugh-2021-embodying p.128]
- Fraleigh [@fraleigh-2021-body] uses phrase in relation to Japanese writer Yasuo and as humans being integral to ecosystems; talks about finding nature (noting from NAHR time that the concept of nature/natural no longer really exists -- everything is touched)
- Sebiane Serrano [@sebianeserrano-2020-mestizo] seems to use the term in very loose way (more like something in fashion/vogue)
- Caetano et al: more like humans and ecosystems (out there) [@caetano-2020-performing]
- Sarco-Thomas [@sarco-thomas-2014-touch p.198] refers to Chrysa Parkinson's art practice as ecosystem questionnaire. <https://nivel.teak.fi/adie/art-practice-as-eco-system-questionnaire/>. Sarco-Thomas also uses the word 'ecology' a lot but doesn't clarify why (or even what she might mean by it). Sense that this is about fashion -- of appealing to nature. Neither does Parkinson but the sense of an ecosystem (as metaphor) is more clearly implicit.

There are two books (not mine), an old watch, a folder or two, some pens, pens holders, insta-photographs from a recent wedding, a lamp, some stickie notes. A speaker, power. A tablet, a case, headphones. 

- attempt to do a little dance here -- to introduce some research while attempting to reach out beyond my solipsism to attempt to understand how that research might be useful to you. That this writing is not _about_ this particular research project (called [[children of the soil - short description of film]])
- get the project out of the way: a short photo essay as part of the writing -- perhaps 6 images occupying a single page? (in a grid) -- perhaps even with some of the graphic novel texts

The second is from the American artist and writer Sophie Strand who describes ecological storytelling as "held between the ripe and the rot" [@ducann-2022-my p.83] (from _As You Like It_). I think it's a useful image to imagine all practice-research as being held between the ripe and the rot. 

- might I be able to fold in interoception/soil/de-corpification/eco-anxiety? (ha ha)
