# borgmann - merton, contemplation and technology

_previous note:_ [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]

Albert Borgmann is a professor of philosophy at the University of Montana. He specialises in writing about the philosophy of society, culture and technology. 

This article, published in _Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith_ examines the thinking and work of trappist monk [Thomas Merton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Merton) regarding contemplation and technology.  

>The crucial feature of the technological culture is the insertion of machinery between humanity and reality.[@borgmann_contemplation_2012 p.4]

Borgmann's position vis-à-vis technology (and supported by the words of Merton he chooses) is clear. Technology -- that which "simply often stands for information technology"[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.8] -- both enables and disables, and at the heart of the problem is how "the culture of technology has finally depressed the glory and the misery of the human condition to distraction and indecision."[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.9]

>Distraction might have been like a long rainy season, as it was for young Merton, or like the occasional hurricane that the monastic Merton knew. Today it is like a permanent, if attractively glamorous, fog. It’s the atmosphere we live in. It has, to be sure, “the phantasms of a lewd and somewhat idiotic burlesque,“ but for many today it’s no longer “fabricated in their imagination.”26 It is worked out in the graphic details of video games, YouTube, and pornography.[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.8]

Borgmann's warning is to suggest that the pattern of technology is most clearly represented by commodification and mechanization:

>Commodification is the detachment of things and practices from their traditional contexts, and it is the conversion of things and practices into freely available commodities. Mechanization is the replacement of traditional contexts and competencies by increasingly powerful and concealed machineries. As workers we indenture ourselves for the requirements of the machinery. As consumers we revel in the abundance of unencumbered pleasures.[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.5]

The pressure that technology is placing on contemplation suggests -- according to Borgmann -- "that Contemplation needs a cloister, a space where the splendor of the simple is secure from mindless distraction and busyness."[@borgmann-2012-contemplation p.9]

Philosopher Aaron Kerr describes that Borgmann's task regarding technology and contemporary life is to:

>invite society to consider just how everyday life is oriented to technology -- in short to inspire a more intentionally aware approach to technological usage, making it secondary to other practices involving more communal, conversational, and contemplative activities.[@kerr_borgmann_2016 pp.59-60]

_questions & thoughts:_

- I'm interested in the 'technology' of the cloister. This is the ways in which -- thinking of Jacobs in [[mythical vs technological core of culture]] and how technology involves manipulation -- the cloister is in itself a technology. This is where Borgmann's writing is not specific enough about what he means by technology.
- but also perhaps the artistic/poetic possibilities of the cloister -- a place for the "splendour of the simple"
- regarding cloister and intentional attitude towards technology, see chapter in Newport's _Digital Minimalism_ on the Amish and their intentional attitude to new technologies and their effects on the community

_consider:_

- compare "insertion of machinery" quote (above) with Jacobs in [[mythical vs technological core of culture]]) - role of tech. Also with Ginot in [[somatics, action and technology]]
- compare with [[device paradigm and focal things]] and [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]
