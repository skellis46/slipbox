# focal activity is a convex lens

_previous note:_ [[borgmann, effort and focal things]]

---

O'Brien cites Borgmann as follows: "[Reading] is a focal activity that collects our world as a convex lens does and radiates back into our world as does a concave mirror." This metaphor of focal things as a convex lens is useful. That focal activity gathers ideas, people, and practices together and gently sends them outwards.

_thoughts & links:_

- The metaphor absorbs (not sure what I mean by this) Ginot's concern that [[there is no natural soma]] because it brings instruments, practices (etc) together.
