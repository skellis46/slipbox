# disciplinary prejudices

_previous note:_ [[specialist and generalist audience in practice-research]]

In their introduction to Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet the editors Tsing, Swanson, Gan and Bubandt write:

> We do not think this work is simple. It requires moving beyond the disciplinary prejudices into which each scholar is trained, to instead take a generous view of what varied knowledge practices might offer. [@gan-2017-haunted p.G2]

I'm fascinated by what the disciplinary prejudices of, say, dance, are; or practice-research (if that might be called a discipline).
