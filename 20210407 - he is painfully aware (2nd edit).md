# 20210407 - he is painfully aware (2nd edit)

This is another edit of the poem I wrote in [[20210315 - thinking about metaphors and themes]]

He is painfully aware  
That this will end in invisibility.  
He has hands to write.  
Hands to open.  
They are still hands, a child's hands.  
They are hands to work out
What might have been
At the mercy of the things we make for new,  
And in hope for where we are.

He is painfully aware  
That this will end in invisibility.  
He has hands to write.  
Hands to hide.  
They are still hands, a human's hands.  
They are hands to work out
What might have been
At the mercy of the things we make,  
And in hope for what might be.

He is painfully aware  
That this will end in invisibility.  
He has hands to work out
What might have been
At the mercy of the things we make,  
And in hope for what might be. 

_and another:_ 

He is painfully / [dutifully] / [surprisingly] / [deliberately] / [delicately] aware  
That this will end in the ground [end lying in the ground] / [all be dust in the ground] / [all end in dust] / .
His hands are to work out
What might have been
At the mercy of the things we made,  
And in hope for what might be.
