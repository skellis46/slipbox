_previous note:_  [[cognitive burden of sitting still]]

It was Frederick Nietzsche who said something like “Never trust a thought that occurs to you indoors.” The first time I remember hearing this was when it was repeated to me by the New Zealand choreographer [Douglas Wright](http://www.douglaswright.net/douglaswright.html). It was 2001 and we (his dance company) were walking in Cornwall Park in Auckland during the very initial development of the choreography that would become _Inland_ (2002). 

I remember being interviewed during the _Inland_ process and I compared being asked to join Douglas's company as akin to being selected for the All Blacks (but without the _haka_). If you were a kiwi dancer, then to work for Douglas was the pinnacle. And we did work _for_ him; we did not work _with_ him. I had wanted to work for Douglas since I saw his work [_Gloria_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2zn5-2Ftno) in 1990. But the distance between my dream of working in Douglas's company and the reality was vast. The pressure that Douglas placed on us was enormous, and his singular vision left little space for the emotional valence of the situation. It was not a pleasant experience and I simply did not cope. You might say my dancing was overwhelmed by fear and self-consiousness. 

But that idea about trusting ideas occurring outside really stuck. Of all the things to remain with me some 20 years later, it was Douglas quoting Nietzsche ... 

One of my guilty pleasures is reading what has been called productivity pr0n. Here's [Cal Newport attempting to explain what that is](https://youtu.be/Or-MBhCWAbo?t=54). If there's a book about understanding methods and systems for doing stuff, chances are I have read it: Chris Bailey's _Hyperfocus_? Check. Newport's _Digital Minimialism_ or _A World Without Email_? Check and check. Dave Allen's _Getting Things Done_? Double check.

In one such book the author mentions the science behind walking outside and thinking. I say _one such book_ because I can't for the life of me find the original text and clearly my systems for gathering, storing and then finding ideas have let me down. But I did manage to find something related; and that is the science behind walking and thinking has to do with how humans perceive the fractals that are fundamental to our aesthetic experience of being in nature:

> a naturally structured environment is easier for us to process. Being conducive to how we naturally process the world, it produces less strain on our perceptual and cognitive system.

- Brielmann, Buras, Salingaros and Taylor (2022, p.5), <https://doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6010003>

In other words, we do less cognitive work when we are walking in natural environments. Even built environments that mirror the fractal properties of natural environments "are perceived as more safe, interesting, comfortable and beautiful" (Brielmann et al, p.14). 

Chris Bailey's _Hyperfocus_ (2019) is a book about, well, focusing. In the second part of the book Bailey describes a type of scatterfocus (allowing the mind to wander while directing attention inwards) that he names problem-crunching mode. It means to hold "a problem loosely in mind and letting your thoughts wander around it" [@bailey-2019-hyperfocus n.pag.]. In _Deep Work_ (2016), Cal Newport describes a similar sounding idea called, wait for it, _productive meditation_. Deep. Sigh. 

Troubling descriptive names aside, Bailey and Newport [1] are more or less applying Nietzsche's aphorism to a specific context. That context is to take a reasonably clear question or problem and be with that problem while walking in nature. To walk in nature while quietly or loosely concentrating on a specific problem is one of the least surprising yet more extraordinary things I have learned from thousands of productivity pr0n pages.

And for all the difficulty of dancing for Douglas Wright, it was a rich, rewarding and indeed illuminating experience. [Walk on Douglas, walk on](https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/arts/108644895/obituary-douglas-wright-a-dreamer-of-dances).

[1]: To be fair to Newport, in _Digital Minimalism_ (2019) he goes into some detail about the walking habits of Nietzsche, Arthur Rimbaud, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Wendell Berry and Henry David Thoreau.
