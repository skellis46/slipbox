# the opposite of paradox is polarization

> the opposite of paradox is polarization.

-- Esther Perel [@brown-2021-partnerships n.pag.]

_thoughts & links:_

- was reminded of [[evidence and protecting the dissenters]] and the work that needs to be done to remain in paradox. That they are hard.
- Perel's thinking seems to apply to any paradoxical situation. See for example [[stockdale paradox]] -- if you can't keep alive hope with reality then you don't 'make it out alive'
- in [[wisdom, care and culture]] note definitions of wisdom as being capacity to appreciate paradox while remaining in uncertainty
