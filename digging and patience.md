# digging and patience

_previous note:_ [[artistic research refers to a method]]

There's a chapter in [Art as a Thinking Process: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production](https://www.sternberg-press.com/product/art-as-a-thinking-process-visual-forms-of-knowledge-production/) by Jeremiah Day called _Digging_.

In it, Day describes helping a friend Erik Smith by videoing him "digging holes in Berlin on a piece of property that is in limbo" (p.65). Day asks Smith if he knows what kind of structure he has discovered but he:

> prefers to sustain the period of this kind of discovery, through digging, attending to the soil and ash, in which a different kind of information is possible, one that is not axiomatic or verifiable." (p.66)

The desire to name seems so tightly connected to the desire to know. But Smith's focus on remaining with the digging is a powerful attitude and practice, regardless of the epistemic conditions or traditions of one's field of discovery.
