# the mechanisms of affordance

_previous note:_ [[technology is neither good nor bad]]

> The mechanisms of affordance refer to the how of human-technology relations, and the conditions refer to variability across subjects and circumstances. Rather than rely on general statements about more and less force exerted by technological objects, the mechanisms of affordance indicate that technologies request, demand, encourage, discourage, refuse, and allow particular lines of action and social dynamics. Requests and demands are initiated by the object, and encouragement, discouragement, and refusal are responses to subjectsâ€™ inclinations. Allow applies to acts initiated by both subjects and objects.[@davis-2020-how Chapter 1. Introduction: Operationalizing Affordances: The Mechanisms and Conditions Framework, n.pag]
