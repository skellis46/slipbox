# swarms in liquid modernity

[[Bauman - Does Ethics Have a Chance in a World of Consumers#^b572cd]]

In liquid modernity groups are replaced by swarms that "assemble, disperse, and come together again from one occasion to another, each time guided by different, invariably shifting relevancies, and attracted by changing and moving targets."[@bauman-2008-does p.15]. Swarms need no leaders, no hierarchies. Each unit of the swarm "reenacts the moves made by the other, while performing the whole job, from beginning to end in all its parts, alone."[@bauman-2008-does p.16] A swarm creates an endless process of copying and making in which any original does not exist or has been forgotten. In a consuming swarm, the job of a swarm is to consume. See here how [[the bias of technology is to copy]] and attempting to resist this bias is futile.

I find Bauman's vision of swarms troubling. They are troubling because I can imagine those two young people dancing (in [[Lithium dancing]]) as part of a consuming swarm. They are leaderless, yet following, copying, refracting, renewing, reinventing, replicating; a recursive loop of dancing and being danced. And what they are following profoundly embedded pleasures/freedoms that have been organised, planned and coded. It is pure enframing. They are blissfully unaware of their enframing. Aren't we all?

Jacobs -- in [[Jacobs - After Technopoly]] -- likens a swarm to incessant copying of images that no longer have an original, and that each unit of the swarm.
