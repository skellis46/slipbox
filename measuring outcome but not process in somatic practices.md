# measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

In [[Hutt - Corrective alignment and injury prevention]] she writes:

> It is possible that the actual process and activity of somatic principles cannot be measured, yet it is probable that the observed outcome of these practised principles can.[@hutt-2010-corrective p.258]

It's not at all clear here what Hutt means by "actual process and activity" of the principles (or even what the principles are). And by "outcome" does she mean qualitatively or quantitatively observable? Are the outcomes the changes in the awareness of the dancer, or how those changes are rendered in the body (e.g. improved [[proprioception]] or [[interoception science overview]])? Or are the outcomes demonstrable changes in injury prevention and recovery (for instance)?

- seems to contradict even a small example in [[Ahmadi - Comparison of the effects of the Feldenkrais method]]
- note idea here about changes in awareness vs changes in the sophistication of the process. That is, in this work (like in meditation) do we get more sensitive to sensation, or are the sensations changing themselves? This idea is discussed similarly here in which the perception of change is different from change in perception 2:40:40 - Harris / Seth <https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/113-consciousness-and-the-self> -- [[perception of change versus change in perception]]
