# measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

In [[Hutt - Corrective alignment and injury prevention]] she writes:

> It is possible that the actual process and activity of somatic principles cannot be measured, yet it is probable that the observed outcome of these practised principles can.[@hutt-2010-corrective p.258]

It's not at all clear here what Hutt means by "actual process and activity" of the principles (or even what the principles are). And by "outcome" does she mean qualitatively or quantitatively observable? Are the outcomes the changes in the awareness of the dancer, or how those changes are rendered in the body (e.g. improved [[proprioception]] or [[interoception science overview]])? Or are the outcomes demonstrable changes in injury prevention and recovery (for instance)?

- seems to contradict even a small example in [[Ahmadi - Comparison of the effects of the Feldenkrais method]]
