# photography freed the hand

_previous note:_ [[an artist confronts their experiential world by means of a craft]]

> Moreover, [photography's] automatic mechanism of capturing attractive, accurate pictorial images likewise removed the traditional need for skilled artistic hands to create them: “For the first time in the process of pictorial reproduction, photography freed the hand of the most important artistic functions which henceforth devolved only upon the eye looking into a lens.”[^3][@shusterman-2012-photography p.67]

- intriguing that this is indeed the same Shusterman in [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]]
- worth tracking more of his writing?
- more that the sense of craft shifted to other aspects of human skill and creativity
