# a border is not a boundary

In _Together_ Richard Sennett describes how there are two different kinds of edges: a border and a boundary. A boundary is more inert; there is little activity at it, while a border is a more active edge. 

>In human ecology, the eight-lane highway isolating parts of the city from each other is a boundary, whereas a mixed-use street at the edge between two communities can be more of a border.[@sennett_together_2012 p.79]

_thoughts & links:_

- I wonder what kind of edge exists between practice-research and other more traditional forms of research? [[biggs and buchler - communities, values, conventions and actions]]
- or between professional artists and academic artists
- thinking also of Jacobs' use of the terms [[doxa and habitus]] and how these are methods of creating boundaries; they are not places to intermingle. They are powerful forces of separation.
- also relates to [[questioning our beliefs]] and how beliefs are about community (boundary) building ... about "being part of something"[@godin_dancing_2020 n.pag.]
- [[the infinite game#^6ad5a3]] -- "finite games having temporal, spatial and numerical boundaries, while infinite games do not."[@carse-1986-finite p.9] Two things to consider: 1) to investigate the line(s) between infinite and finite games as being a border rather than a boundary (as Sennett describes them); 2) perhaps this thinking re boundaries and borders is useful for [[the custodians]].
