# existing between subject and object

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

on 22 November 2024 I did the Beginnings session at C-DaRE. 
I wonder about the possibility of somehow (!) existing between subject/object ... what might that be like? No I. No I. That I simply keep resisting the temptation to objectify. What might that be like?
