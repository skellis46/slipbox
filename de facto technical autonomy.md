# de facto technical autonomy

_previous note:_ [[Newport introducing technological determinism]]

>My own view is that we live in an era of de facto technical autonomy. By that I mean that our ability to choose which technologies influence our lives and how they influence our lives has become, for reasons I’ll explain, increasingly limited. We do have choices, no question, but we’re not nearly as free to choose as we think. I can restrict my own use of technology, but I have considerably less ability to limit my exposure to the technology that surrounds me. Climate change, depletion of species, the presence of various pollutants in our bodies, and many other environmental repercussions of technology affect literally every person on the planet. That’s one aspect of what I mean by de facto technological autonomy. The social and economic demands of the technological society can, theoretically, be avoided, but not without adopting a lifestyle of radical disconnection.[@hill-2016-not n.pag.]
