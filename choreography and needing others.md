# choreography and needing others

_previous note:_  [[I am a collaboration]]

I'm currently in Sardegna working with the choreographers [Igor x Moreno](https://igorandmoreno.com) on their latest project _Karrasekare_. We've collaborated some 10 years now and I am, at least in name, their dramaturg. I say "in name" because what I do for them is quite fluid, and depends on their needs and the progress of the work. I've written about our work together previously in [Attention, Friendship and Dramaturgy](https://www.skellis.net/attention-friendship-and-dramaturgy).  

Yesterday -- this is mid-November 2022 -- as we were talking before rehearsals began, it occurred to me that what I really am to them is someone who cares and that is available to discuss where they are at and to respond to what they are doing. It's not so different from the kind of work I do as a supervisor to PhD students when I ask the question, "How best can I serve you in this moment?"  

The writer Alan Jacobs has a weekly newsletter called _Snakes and Ladders_ (highly recommended, but not if it means quitting this newsletter). In the edition from 14 November 2022 called [Welcome to the Working Week](https://buttondown.email/ayjay/archive/welcome-to-the-working-week/) he cites Kate Bowler on how the word _precarity_ comes  from the Latin  _precarius_ -- “obtained by entreaty or prayer” -- and means "a state of dangerous uncertainty" in which "we cannot achieve things by ourselves". 

The artist [Sophie Strand suggests something similar when she says](https://dark-mountain.net/my-body-the-ancestor/), "I am a collaboration."

I also happened to mention the idea of precarity and the need for others to a PhD student I work with -- [Rachael Davies](https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/rachael-davies-3) -- and later she sent me some writing by Judith Butler called _Frames of War_. In the introduction, Butler -- the so-called [icon of bad academic writing](http://www.matthiasbrinkmann.de/wordpress/2016/12/judith-butler-on-difficult-writing/) -- writes: 

> Precariousness implies living socially, that is, the fact that one's life is always in some sense in the hands of the other. It implies exposure both to those we know and to those we do not know; a dependency on people we know, or barely know, or know not at all.(p.14)

These various things -- Jacobs, Strand, Butler and the conversation with Igor and Moreno -- made me think that making any art involves a substantial degree of precarity. Such dangerous uncertainty (although obviously not literally dangerous) won't come as any surprise to those of you who have tried to make anything in which the final form cannot be known until it is known. Perhaps under such conditions of making we all need someone to depend on because we cannot achieve things by ourselves: we are collaborations. Surely Igor and Moreno would make a remarkable choreography without my involvement but I suspect that by being in their service I am able to help them work with and through that state of unknowing precarity. By having someone to lean or rely on who is slightly more _outside_ of the work they are able to gain or regain perspectives that are lost in the mangle of making.
