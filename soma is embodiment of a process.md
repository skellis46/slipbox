# soma is embodiment of a process

_previous note:_ [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]

> A soma is any individual embodiment of a process, which endures and adapts through time, and it remains a soma as long as it lives. The moment that it dies it ceases to be a soma and becomes a body. (Hanna 1976: 31) [in @eddy-2017-mindful p.5]

- [[definition of mindfulness]]
- [[there is no natural soma]]
