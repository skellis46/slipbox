# phonocentrism and the really real


>A critique of using post analyses at the 2013 Bergamo conference was that research using a post analysis like genealogy is “just textual analysis.” But I would argue that that comment functions in the material/textual binary enabled by the ontology and empiricism of conventional humanist qualitative methodology that identifies the material or “empirical”—the bedrock real, the foundation, the origin— as first order and primary, and language and/or discourse—just text— as second-order, unreliable, and representational. What matters and counts as the empirical in that methodology is the face-to-face collection of data in the present—think of Geertz’s (1988) phrase “being there” (p. 1). The language that matters is spoken, heard language. Written language, the text, is supposedly too far removed from the present, the really real, to matter much. This is phonocentrism.[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.11]

>But Derrida (1967/1974) explained this half a century ago, and his post analysis, deconstruction, is a critique of Plato’s ontology, its phonocentrism, and its privileging of presence, which grounds the “face-to-face” demands of qualitative methodology’s ontology and empiricism and thus relegates the text to secondary status. Derrida deconstructed the material/textual binary early on when he wrote, “There is nothing outside of the text [there is no outside-text; il n’y a pas de hors-texte]” (p. 158).[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.11]

-- useful in the sense that 'presence' is required in #finger-pointing-moon. being there does matter. not to privilege presence, but to acknowledge its fundamental role in this particular practice

>In this regard, Deleuze and Guattari (1980/1987) explained that the material/linguistic distinction does not work in their ontology, “There is no longer a tripartite division between a field of reality (the world) and a field of representation (the book) and a field of subjectivity (the author)” (p. 23). The hierarchy that enables the privileging of the material in the material/textual dualism is not thinkable in their ontology, and the “just textual analysis” distinction doesn’t make sense. However, I believe it is very difficult for those of us well-trained in the empiricism that grounds conventional humanist qualitative inquiry not to think that material/textual binary, not to privilege language collected “in the field” and “face-to-face” over already written language—in other words, it’s difficult not to privilege presence.[@adamsst.pierre-2014-brief p.12]
