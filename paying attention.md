# paying attention

_previous note:_ [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]

>Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. This kind of attention nurtures greater awareness, clarity, and acceptance of present-moment reality. It wakes us up to the fact that our lives unfold only in moments. If we are not fully present for many of those moments, we may not only miss what is most valuable in our lives but also fail to realize the richness and the depth of our possibilities for growth and transformation.[@kabat-zinn-2004-wherever n.pag.]

- noting here Martha Eddy writing that "by paying attention to the body, one is paying attention to the mind."[@eddy-2017-mindful p.6]. This doesn't seem so far from [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing#^46b1f1]]
