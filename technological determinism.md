# technological determinism

Technological determinism is the idea that technological development determines social change or human behaviour. The _problem_ is seen everywhere. 

In _Present Shock_, Douglas Rushkoff suggests we should focus on how we change ourselves: 

>The things we use do change us. In order to understand and contend with present shock, we should probably be less immediately concerned with the cause-and-effect consequences of digital activity than with the greater implications and requirements of living in the digital environment. It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]
^7a118d

Consider technological determinism in relation to [[gestell and enframing]] and [[device paradigm and focal things]]. Focal things in particular seem to resist technological determinism.

_thoughts & links:_

- note from edit bin of [[Lithium dancing]]:

Technological determinism is the idea that technological development determines social change or human behaviour. These represent old and rather obvious stories of technology. , , so old that it is little more than a trope or meme. In the _The Gutenberg Galaxy_ (1962) Marshall McLuhan wrote ... Heidegger; Determinism.

This is the history of technologies –- affording certain behaviours, preventing others . 

Affordances . Gibson. Technologies afford behaviours 
- two perspectives; one is what is afforded by the interaction and indeed the technology. Technologies afford behaviours. 

The _problem_ is seen everywhere. In dance, technological determinism can be seen as a problem or a possibility. Cooper Albright has written of "how the ubiquity of screens in contemporary dance affects how we watch movement"[@cooperalbright-2012-tensions p.21], and Ellis has described how the hyper-presence of movement on screens has increased screendance literacy[@ellis-2018-faces] 

Again, this is a cliche. We are changed. But how is the question, and do we want this? Or perhaps it's the invisible things (as Postman says) that are the key? [[Postman - Technopoly]]
