# the essence of selfhood is about your body

_previous note:_ [[losing one's self]]

> In my view, consciousness has more to do with being alive than with being intelligent. We are conscious selves precisely because we are beast machines. I will make the case that experiences of being you, or of being me, emerge from the way the brain predicts and controls the internal state of the body. The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul. It is a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body. [@seth-2021-being LocationÂ 150]

Makes me think of how difficult it is to navigate the language of self, consciousness and being a person (something that [[Garfield - Losing Ourselves]] does beautifully). That to avoid talk of the self (and to make nonduality more possible linguistically) will always be difficult.
