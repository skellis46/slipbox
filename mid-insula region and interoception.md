# mid-insula region and interoception

_previous note:_ [[the overlap between bodily and emotional feelings]]

Outcome from Camilla Nord's research:

> To my surprise, [I found that](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.20091340), during interoception, patients with depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, anorexia and schizophrenia all showed ‘abnormal’ activity in one specific brain region called the insula, compared with healthy control volunteers.[@nord-2022-brain]

> The insula is well known as a key player in sensing the state of the body; it’s also involved in pain and emotion processing. But there is more to the story. Different insula subregions are involved in different functions, and the subregion where I found a difference in mental health patients was specifically the mid-insula. The mid-insula is distinctive anatomically because its cellular architecture is a hybrid: somewhere between the cells that make up the front of the insula (anterior insula) and the back of the insula (posterior insula). Moreover, this hybrid structure is relevant to this subregion’s connections, which allow it to communicate both with the more emotion-related anterior insula and the more body-sensing-related posterior insula. Perhaps then, the area of the insula affected in mental health disorders has a special role in a person’s subjective feelings, integrating input from the body with expectations and emotions related to the internal bodily state.[@nord-2022-brain]

Nord's research does not tell us about the mechanisms for "why this region is commonly disrupted in psychiatric disorders"[@nord-2022-brain n.pag.], and no causal information is available. 

> If [the mid-insula region] does play a causal role, another important and potentially exciting goal is to find out whether mental health treatments could try to ‘normalise’ the function of the insula as a way to alleviate people’s difficulties.[@nord-2022-brain] 

- gives links to interventions based on mindfulness and slow breathing -- both of which increase insula activation.
