# 20210309 - playing and catching 

Very sunny, bright. Did series of tests with GoPro trying to get a better sense of how different features work. Went to 720p so I could get a look at 240fps. Below are the tests with CAPS indicating the changes. Started running, playing and catching a bit from number 3. Continued that for remaining two tests. 

1. [06_GOPR8081.MP4 ]720p, 240fps, N FoV, 5500k, color: flat, shutter: auto; iso: 400; sharpness: low; EVC: -0.5 ^a058fe
2. [07_GOPR8082.MP4] 720p, 240fps, N FoV, 5500k, COLOR: GoPro, shutter: auto; iso: 400; sharpness: low; EVC: -0.5 ^241c58

Question with this footage -- in which I am tossing the camera while moving quite quickly -- is really about how dexterous I might become with the camera, how little time is stay in the hand, and what I can do physically while the camera is out of my hands. #ideatotry ^f5656c

What kind of orientations might I provide to the viewer: like some kind of animated gyroscope? Or also a 3rd person perspective? (another camera). Could be attached to me or could be separate. Towards end of 09 I start moving more. Amped it up in 10. Really like footage when camera is dropped. #ideatotry   ^d915a7

Shadow is super useful -- more perspectives of me to orientate. Wonder what it would be like in lighting setup. Multiple shadows. Maybe some colours. projection. #ideatotry  ^e74ff8

Didn't spend any viewing time in PP looking at differences between the materials (with different camera settings). Update: Did this in [[20210315 - through things]]
