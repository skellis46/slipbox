# pragmatic epistemology

_previous note:_ [[thomson - practice as research]]

In Thomson's collection of conversations about PaR in 1993 Paul Kleiman cites this from Heylighen (also 1993):

>According to pragmatic epistemology, knowledge consists of models that attempt to represent the environment in such a way as maximally to simplify problem-solving. It is assumed that no model can ever hope to capture all relevant information, and even if such a complete model did exist, it would be too complicated to use in any practical way. Therefore we must accept the parallel existence of different models, even though they may seem contradictory. The model which is to be chosen depends on the problems that are to be solved. The basic criterion is that the model should produce correct (or approximate) predictions (which may be tested) or problem- solutions, and be as simple as possible. [Heylighen 1993, cited by Kleiman in @thomson_practice_2003 p.176]

It remains my sense that PaR has little or no interest in solving problems, and even less interest in arriving at or excavating any kinds of _truth_. That perhaps even part of the reason PaR was able to come into being was because of post-modern thinking and presence in the Academy. But, at the same time, this doomed PaR to be completely disinterested in truth. What's more, the support mechanisms for PaR in the academy tend to produce PaR projects that are auto-ethnographic [[mesearch]]. This reduces the potential for profoundly critical and even reasoned responses to what is there. We are only ever vaguely the finger, and not even close to recognising that there is even a moon there. ^0d1c3c

- [[finger pointing at the moon]]
- reminded here of [[map and territory]] -- but the proposition here is to use many (or different) maps depending on "the problems to be solved"
- here's the Heylighen original reference (can't believe it's still online): <http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/EPISTEMI.html> -- have added reference to zotero and here is pdf: [heylighen-1993-epistemology.pdf](hook://file/s9vBdjeV0?p=RHJvcGJveC9iaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkgcGRmcw==&n=heylighen-1993-epistemology.pdf)
