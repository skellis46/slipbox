# solving problems that need solving

_previous note:_ 

> Being validated for who we are today is great. But it’s more likely that we can achieve our goals by choosing to become someone who can solve problems that the people we serve need solved.

> A coach can quickly tell when someone is committed to changing their approach in order to change the outcome–it’s easy to tell this person apart from someone who simply wants what they’re already doing to be more effective.
