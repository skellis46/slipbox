# everything is becoming otherwise

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself - somatics chapter]]

This is a simple thing to reduce the sense of the body being 'solid' or fixed, particularly when it feels like such a strong guide in the practice. 

This phrase "everything is becoming otherwise" appeared on the Waking Up app while listening in the night but I lost track of which talk. I thought it was Goldstein in [[undistracted non-meditation]] but it wasn't I wrote down the phrase and then later looked it up. It appears here:

David Daniel quote Goldstein but not where he found the source. I think it might be mentioned here (and probably plenty of other sources):
