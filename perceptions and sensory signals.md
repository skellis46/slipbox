# perceptions and sensory signals

_previous note:_ 

> But Wittgenstein was driving at something deeper. His real message for Anscombe was that even with a greater understanding of how things actually are, at some level things still appear the same way they always did. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, same as always. (Location 1338)

> Perceptions do not come from the bottom up or the outside in, they come primarily from the top down, or the inside out. What we experience is built from the brain’s predictions, or ‘best guesses’, about the causes of sensory signals. (Location 1346) ^4acfff

- noting here a clear distinction between perception and 'sensing' (which is different from sensation?)-- or is sensing different too from sensory signals? 

> This is by no means a wholly new idea. The first glimmers of a top-down theory of perception emerge in ancient Greece, with Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. Prisoners, chained and facing a blank wall all their lives, see only the play of shadows cast by objects passing by a fire behind them, and they give the shadows names, because for them the shadows are what is real. The allegory is that our own conscious perceptions are just like these shadows, indirect reflections of hidden causes that we can never directly encounter. (Location 1349)

> Hundreds of years later again, Immanuel Kant realised that the chaos of unrestricted sensory data would always remain meaningless 81without being given structure by pre-existing conceptions, which for him included a priori frameworks like space and time. Kant’s term noumenon refers to ‘things in themselves’ – Ding an sich – a mind-independent reality that will always be inaccessible to human perception, hidden behind a sensory veil. (Location 1355)

- at this point Seth goes onto to talk about [[the self is a controlled hallucination]]
