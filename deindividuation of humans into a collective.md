# deindividuation of humans into a collective

> The rise of the so-called internet of everything—which involves the incorporation of networked sensors and actuators into everything in the world, including human beings—could enable rational integration and coordination at an unprecedented scale. The historian Yuval Noah Harari argues in his book Homo Deus (2016) that this technology enables the deindividuation of humans into a collective. [Danaher, John & Petersen, Steve. (2020). In Defence of the Hivemind Society. Neuroethics. 10.1007/s12152-020-09451-7.] 

- This idea is from Chapter 9 of Harari's Homo Deus: The Great Decoupling
- I first stumbled across the concept while listening to Talking Politics: History of Ideas about Hannah Arendt's work
