# deindividuation of humans into a collective

_previous note:_ [[to define the meaning of we]]

> The rise of the so-called internet of everything—which involves the incorporation of networked sensors and actuators into everything in the world, including human beings—could enable rational integration and coordination at an unprecedented scale. The historian Yuval Noah Harari argues in his book Homo Deus (2016) that this technology enables the deindividuation of humans into a collective.[@danaher-2021-defence n.pag]

- This idea is originally from Chapter 9 of Harari's Homo Deus: The Great Decoupling
- I first stumbled across the concept while listening to Talking Politics: History of Ideas about Hannah Arendt's work
