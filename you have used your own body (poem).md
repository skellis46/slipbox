# you have used your own body (poem)

_previous note:_ [[rituals are architectures of time]]

> You have used your own body
> to measure the age of the mountains and rivers.
> You have manifested yourself
> as trees, grass, butterflies, single-celled beings,
> and as chrysanthemums.
> But the eyes with which you look at me this morning
> tell me that you have never died.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.67]
