# why practice matters in the academy - moving and being moved

- 1999, in a nightclub, Melbourne, dance elder, 50-50
- a haven: a place to practice choreography while supported financially
- this sense of a haven still exists I think, although different conditions
- naive to imagine my practice would not be changed by that interface with the academy

- Newton's third law of motion: every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
- for example: falling and landing onto the earth: The force I apply to the earth is equal to the force the earth applies to me. You might say the earth moves me as I move it. It's just a question of scale, or more accurately, mass. 
- and so it is with the Academy: it is a large collection of institutions that are different by degree; apparently immovable or solid relative to the peculiar, specific and small instances of artistic practice. My practice is likely to feel the effects of that interface or impact more than the Academy will. 

- up to now the work of practice-research has mostly been about establishing, gaining a foothold; finding a way to exist in the Academy. This has been at two levels: through individual artistic-research projects that exist as mostly insulated cells of understanding and experience; and at level of policy whereby practice-research is a grudgingly accepted -- but poorly understood -- part of the entire scholarly research family
- both levels have (obviously) been integral to the academy as a haven for artists

- I think though there is a third level: it's the way in which practice-research might reach beyond its own boundaries and be in dialogue with long-standing and entrenched ideas of how knowledge is gathered, developed, understood and communicated. I don't mean in some solipsistic or self-serving way, but rather to actively and proactively extend practice-research beyond the margins of its own small community. 

On the one hand it must sustain the way it serves "to protect the obscure, the ineffable, the unmarketable, the unmanageable, the local, the poetic, and the eccentric"[@solnit-2016-hope p.96] -- a vital and pivotal role remind us we are considering epistemic things that are not convenient to express (from Postman). On the other hand, how might these hard to grasp methods, alternate epistemologies and embodied understandings -- inconvenient things to express -- move the extraordinarily large mass of the Academy such that the Academy is able to understand that it is being moved, and how? 

This is why practice matters in the academy. 

It is because practice-research is the articulation of "unfinished thinking".[@borgdorff-2013-artistic p.117]

Builds on work and ideas of Michael Biggs and Daniela Buchler from early 2010s. [@biggs-2011-communities] 

- let me say what I understand practice to be. It's not necessarily producing a thing, an artefact; although it might be.



PaR (as opposed to just making art -- want to draw the distinction) represents a way to understand and recognise the questions we ask of the practices, ourselves, of others, and of the world; the questions that emerge from these things; what becomes possible; what is afforded by these practices. 





- two parts: 
	- instrumental -- this is the tide, and it's demanding to swim against. also presents opportunities. it begs/demands the question, "why does this research matter and to whom?" this is not a problem or issue peculiar to dance, and certainly not to practice-research. It's the air we breathe. But I think practice-research has something to offer here.
	- blue-sky; the uncertain, the implausible, the coming to grips with something. 
	- what then are our responsibilities?
		- to build robust cases for instrumental research

- practice in academia and practice out. Are we talking about the same thing? 

Thinking about instrumentalisation of research. Problem solving. As if all research is like an engineering or design problem. PaR seemed to be a way to think differently about research, more akin to pure science. Sense of wonder about the ways of the world. But as in science, that has more or less gone. Rather than make PaR something like this, it has been morphed into solving problems. 




Instrumentalisation is the terrifying and terrible part of the impact agenda. I'm not entirely against the agenda; many many good things have come from it, not least an awareness of how we might communicate understandings to the wider public. But, the very worst thing is this sense of "I do this and it produces this". It's a mentality that now runs deep in the academy. Like we are all engineers. Prototyping. But, in reality we are more akin to scientists or religious people (who themselves are far more alike than they'd mostly ever care to admit): seeking wonder, seeking the unknown, the inexplicable. Wonder.

prep talk for conference thing (see “99 Theses on the Revaluation of Value” on Manifold @uminnpress = for PaR talk, not able to be quantified, but is in system of quantification. Paradox.

And the mass of an institution like the Academy -- and places of research -- is changing, is being moved. These academics are trying to make sense when we in practice-research talk about alternate epistemologies, when we talk about embodied understandings, when we talk about   

>Panel 2 - Why practice matters – if practice is part of dance research, then what needs to change to reflect the value of practice as an epistemic system? for our Dance Research Matters event on Thursday 27th May.


P.60 solnit. Specific plane of abstraction. I'm think about PaR and it's place in the academy. I can't continue to hold this abstraction. That's where it's value lies but it's so fragile. So tenuous. So corruptible. So deeply submerged in finite longing for uncertainty. "He was incapable of keeping his mind on a sufficient plane of abstraction, where ideology and rhetoric fly more freely."
I understand that artist in the academy exists on a kind of plane of abstraction. There are the epistemic possibilities of traditional or perhaps conventional scholarly practices like science, in which we come to know things; and artistic practices which contravene such epistemic possibilities. Contradictions. What's more likely? -- that the brutal strength, traditions and conventions of the academy might whip artistic practice into shape, or that artistic practices might infect the academy with ... 

- But it came with, and still comes with a particular pound of flesh. naive to imagine that placing or inserting my practice in research institution will not change what I do or how I understand it. And it ought to. But, like Newton's third law of gravity, the academy and those research institutions are also changed by the presence of artists. When I jump then land, I exert the same equal and opposite force on the earth as it does on me. I am moved by it, as it is moved by me. The difference is merely that of mass. 

- Look into Wendell Berry re value talk

Toast. Buttered toast. The taste of cinnamon. Can't get rid of the taste. 
Something changed. The experience is fundamentally different. 

- dance practice research matters. Statement reveals uncertainty. It's a claim. A land grab. It's riddled with self-doubt, like a toddler screaming, "don't you know I matter?" It's already a defensive position. Anyone or thing certain of themselves does not say "this is why I matter". It's assumed, or performed. Want to let that go. It has been 30 years more or less that practice has existed in the Uni system. Time to move on. Rather, it's the matters of practice-research that interest me. 

- dance research matters: to whom? addressing audience. 
- which audience? 
- But dance is not taken seriously.

- not presenting my projects. why does practice-research matter? the value/need for practice-research.
- what can practice-research offer re funding screens. problems of translation to other audiences? 
- instrumentalisation of research vs for its own sake 
- practice-research existing between other communities (bridging communities)
- arguing for its importance
