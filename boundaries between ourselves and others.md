# boundaries between ourselves and others

_previous note:_ [[a border is not a boundary]]

> In a conflict, even though we are deeply concerned, we remain impartial, able to love and to understand both sides. We shed all discrimination and prejudice, and remove all boundaries between ourselves and others. As long as we see ourselves as the one who loves and the other as the one who is loved, as long as we value ourselves more than others or see ourselves as different from others, we do not have true equanimity.[@nhathanh-2007-teachings p.8]
