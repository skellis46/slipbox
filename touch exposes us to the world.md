# touch exposes us to the world

_previous note:_ [[nature, art and habitat proposal]]

---

David Williams writes about art and performance. In his blog post [be a mountain](https://www.davidwilliams-skywritings.co.uk/2020/01/be-mountain.html) he discusses the film by Lucy Cash and Simone Kenyon called _How the earth must see itself (a thirling)_. The writing explores the way the film asks us to consider our relationship to the world, and in particular the world of mountains. But there's a particular paragraph that grabbed me by the scruff of the neck. Williams writes how touch involves "a corporeal doing that exposes the sensitivity, porosity and vulnerability of the self to the world."[@williams_be_2020 n.pag.] That we encounter the world and are encountered by the world through touch. That we become "more-than-oneself"[@williams_be_2020 n.pag.] through touch -- it provides a pathway to difference.

Below is the full quote (just for the record):

>As a range of writers, philosophers and phenomenologists have suggested over the past half-century or so – Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Emanuel Levinas, Luce Irigaray, Hélène Cixous, Elizabeth Grosz and others – touch, the first sense to develop in the human foetus, involves a corporeal doing that exposes the sensitivity, porosity and vulnerability of the self to the world. As act and metaphor, touch represents the impingement of the world as a whole upon subjectivity; and touching locates oneself in proximity with the givens of the world, rather than in opposition to them. At the threshold of inside and outside, touch as encounter and interface with the more-than-oneself, the event of another. Touch as _a modality of difference_.[@williams_be_2020 n.pag.]

_thoughts & links:_

- this writing seems far less abstract than Barker's thinking I outline in [[touch and film]], yet it remains deeply poetic
- fascinating and plausible link with how we might touch [[the really real]] (as asked by Kerr), as if Williams is suggesting that Cash's film offers that possibility; 
- or perhaps that being on a mountain is similar to how a [[focal activity is a convex lens]] (curious given Cash's use of digital and analogue technology as a medium for such an experience)
- see also [[contemplation beyond rationalization]] and the definition of contemplation
