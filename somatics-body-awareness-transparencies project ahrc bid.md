_previous note:_ [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project]]

## Summary 500
(what you want to do)

### Context

In _somatics-body-awareness-transparencies_ we propose to use the somatically informed art project _Transparencies_ [@davies-2018-transparencies] as a vehicle to deepen cross-disciplinary understanding of the complex interactions between body awareness, affective responses and visual images. Specifically our research question is ...

Somatics is the field that studies the body as it is perceived from the inside [@hanna-1995-what p.341] and it describes various processes and practices which involve "listening deeply to the body" [@eddy-2009-brief p.6]. Such practices are now fundamental to Western professional contemporary dance training [@weber-2009-integrating; @enghauser-2007-developing].

Historically, qualitative and post-qualitative somatics research has focused on describing different practices and the presumed efficacy of such practices (particularly re health and well-being) [@ellis-2023-somatics]. The claims made by dance-informed researchers on behalf of somatics practices are varied including "embodied self-care" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200]; improved "functioning of the mind-body" [@mattes-2016-attentional p.260]; developing spatial awareness [@batson-2007-revisiting]; improved movement efficiency [@batson-2007-revisiting]; become pain free [@eddy-2009-brief]; and physical harmony [@mullan-2014-somatics]. 

Scientists group somatic practices together as _mindful movement approaches_ and, despite the somewhat troubled relationship between somatic practices and science [e.g. @ginot-2010-shusterman; @batson-2012-integrating; @hutt-2010-corrective; @williamson-2009-formative; @green-2007-american; @mehling-2020-if; @schwartz-2014-this; @wait-2023-improvised], scientific studies of these practices are increasingly common. Such research indicates that the "key element and mechanism of action by which somatic practices function is enhanced body awareness" [@mehling-2011-body p.1]. In dance research, Weber describes how "somatics is a field that seeks to repair the body/mind dualism through bodily awareness" [@weber-2009-integrating p.237].

There is now reliable scientific evidence that somatic practices (and other mindful movement practices) improve body awareness (citation?)

> Body awareness involves an attentional focus on and awareness of internal body sensations. [@mehling-2011-body p.1]

Objective measures of body awareness are limited in that they tend to "test the equivalent of your visual acuity when looking at modern art in a museum, rather than how you process what you see and feel" [@mehling-2020-if p.256].

Experienced mind-body therapists view body awareness as inseparable from embodied self-awareness [@mehling-2011-body]. Similarly we propose that the term embodied intelligence is indistinguishable from body awareness, and this research focuses on body awareness during the complex visual-affective process in _Transparencies_ (2018).

> Body awareness, as we define it here, is the subjective, phenomenological aspect of proprioception and interoception that enters conscious awareness, and is modifiable by mental processes including attention, interpretation, appraisal, beliefs, memories, conditioning, attitudes and affect. [@mehling-2011-body p.1]


- what is difference between sensation, attention, awareness and perception? 
> Somatic awareness, a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of health and wellbeing, is the conscious perception and interpretation of physiological states and sensations <https://www.brainfirsttraininginstitute.com/blog/somatic-awareness-the-science-of-connecting-mind-and-body>



- see [[the somatic marker hypothesis of Damasio]] and Craig's neural basis for body awareness



also real-world activities (re interoception) like London Trading Floor [@kandasamy-2016-interoceptive]



- body awareness contributes to our subjective emotional experience [[body awareness and emotion]] -- is Transparencies affording such 'emotional experiences'? (I think it is but then I've been trained in this 'searching' when watching art)


### the challenge the project addresses

- what is the problem here? What if it is something akin to: "How might we understand what is happening in this practice?"
- what can we learn from (contemporary) dance in addition to how it functions as an art form? 
- lines between understandings generated through open-ended processes and practices like Transparencies, _and_ different methodological and epistemic approaches. Focus here on arts, but wanting to build dialogues across disciplinary boundaries.

- what if it's starting to unknot the complexity of the dancer responding in T? (name these things: awareness, openness, flexible mentality, non-judgemental, interoceptive ability, body awareness ... etc???)
- challenge is to understand how T works as a _practice of performance_ and thereby to trouble, qualify, complicate and challenge   

- Important to tune people. But it's also more accessible than regular 'somatic practices' [see for instance @millman-2021-neurocognitive] and involves more direct action (unlike meditation or mindfulness practices). Can I make a case for it like this? 

- this list of words meaning 'without a solution' is telling <https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/without_a_solution.html>

- so much dance training seems to be about undoing the literal -- is this correct? (coping with abstraction??)
- describe the state of unknowing and openness (and of not being judged)

- The question of transferability – could dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities? (Sally: This seems to cut to the 'purpose' of the research, which seems to be to find out more about the whether dancers embodied intelligence/body awareness/body listening… in some way enhances what they understand in relation to these images ….  And by comparison, how this differs from 'novices'.)

- acknowledge [[the inexpressible nature of experience]]
- and revels in "the open-endedness of what can constitute an aesthetic experience" [@brincker-2015-aesthetic p.119]. 

- and yet on the surface Transparencies seems to have qualities and processes in common with established methods in other disciplines.
- hunch is that those people trained in somatic practices are able to access different kinds of experiences differently. 

- but what of the role of somatic practices -- and specifically body awareness -- in experiencing an artistic work and practice? 
- My hunch is that this very open attitude towards abstract activities (in which the dancer is given permission and support so as not to feel judged) makes possible heightened body awareness (or listening to the body) (or could it be vice-versa?). If an attitude of “I don’t understand, I need to get this right, what if I get this wrong?” is present, then this would likely make it impossible to be sensitive to the body. The body’s capacity to sense and listen would be ‘blinded’ by doubt and perceived judgement. 
		+ fear of being wrong
		+ activity that is not goal-directed 

### aims and objectives

- T as springboard for inquiry (remembering it was developed and presented as work of art -- for entirely different rationale)
- discover overlaps and intersections between Transparencies as an interactive dialogic practice and other photo and elicitation methods (photo elicitation, photo voice, experience sampling) 
- see paper by Weiser on phototherapy: [[Weiser - PhotoTherapy Techniques in Counselling and Therapy]] -- some overlaps (in the highlights) with Transparencies.
- The question of transferability – could  dancers’ understandings as expressed or observed in a project like Transparencies generalise to other circumstances and activities? Sally: "This seems to cut to the 'purpose' of the research, which seems to be to find out more about the whether dancers embodied intelligence/body awareness/body listening… in some way enhances what they understand in relation to these images ….  And by comparison, how this differs from 'novices'. " 
- partnership building 
- relationship of T to already existing photo-oriented methods
- Might a more quantitative and qualitative understanding of the things ‘we do’ in dance help generate broader understanding (and perhaps even value) for the importance of embodied understandings (whatever such an understanding is)?
- The broad role of Transparencies can be understood as motivating and facilitating the interpretation of other, more specific theories ... etc. (which perhaps is where Jane's role is?) (this from [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project#^cd2a8f]])

### potential applications and benefits

- exploratory research 
- potential follow-on questions are 1) what can broader society learn from that body intelligence? Could it be used, for example, to help us to determine what harmful internet content is? Or might it help in understanding and changing the ways in which young people use and are used by image-based social media like Instagram? 2) Are there conceptualisations and understandings that emerge from working with Transparencies that motivate and facilitate the interpretation of other, more specific theories (which are then able to be tested empirically)? 
- We could focus on content moderation or equally on social media users, as the kinds of insights we discussed generating would potentially have relevance to either.

## Vision 500
articulate why this is important

## Approach 1500
how you're going to do it and what it builds on

_Transparencies_ (2018) is an art project by choreographer Siobhan Davies. In it Davies works with 1 to 20 participants, and together they stand at a large table and place, arrange, rearrange and overlay more than 100 images printed on acetate paper. The images are mostly single figures caught in a moment of movement, and are drawn from visual art, dance, sports and science. The primary physical motion is the act of moving the photographs, an interaction that is punctuated by periods of quiet reflection and moments of unprompted dialogue. The work is also not goal-directed – Davies is not looking for particular things or for audience members to have specific experiences. In this regard, _Transparencies_ has properties in common with other structurally fluid interactive process-based artworks like _Extended Hermeneutics_ (Lacey, 2019), _Gramsci Monument_ (Hirschhorn, 2013), _A Little Piece of Care_ (Fayard, 2018), and _These Associations_ (Sehgal, 2012). _Transparencies_ is not overtly dance. Rather, it is choreographic because it asks its participants (including Davies herself) to spatially organise and re-organise the images and to notice how these changes _feel_. It draws attention to the body in two ways: 1) the content of the images themselves; 2) reflection on 'where' sensation is directly felt and experienced in the body. 

- useful set of ideas in [[interpretative phenomenological analysis]] (taken from wikipedia page): e.g. purposive sampling, homogenuous sampling
- or possibly [[ecological momentary assessment]]
- or Body Perception Questionnaire (check out references in this reference): [@kolacz-2023-body]

- is it somatic? If so, how? what kinds of instructions does Sue give to the participant? (or will give)
- Complex perceptual activity (primarily visual), physical action (manipulation/rearrangement of images), imagination, non-conceptual -- emotional, corporeal? To act as an accessible bridge. Somatic activity? Or intellectual? 
- Transparencies is levelling -- doesn't require pre-knowledge or confidence re movement. But how different from meditation then? (or, say, Feldenkrais). Can we argue that it is essentially a body-less corporeal activity?? (on the surface it is no such thing)
- but there's no such thing as 'success' when it comes to Transparencies

-  are we suggesting that Transparencies is somehow special? Or rather that it is accessible to us and makes things accessible to others? 

- note Sally's idea re an initial method/period of 'finding out': "I suggest that we build into the project a kind of methods design phase, where we try out a few ways of using the Transparencies methods to help us ensure its suitability for the people with whom we want to engage."
	+ 1. qualitative analysis of embodied intelligence of experienced (somatics) practitioners versus novices (ie people not trained in somatic practices) engaged in the Transparencies activity ?; use thematic analysis to inform phase 2?
	+ 2. quantitative phase: take one or two aspects of the task (emerging from phase 1) and measure these. These measurements would act as ‘somatic markers’ or proxies of the dancers’ embodied intelligence. Perhaps this phase might involve learning/training for inexperienced participants

- use a range of mixed methodologies to directly compare two groups of people: one group of experts in somatic practices; the other group with little or no experience of somatic practices. The groups will be matched for age and demographics. Use a series of qualitative self-reporting scales (e.g. MAIA-II interoceptive awareness test, five facet mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ), and Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ, Shields et al., 1989)), interviews with subsequent thematic analysis
- two parts:
	+ tune the participant to this state of not knowing/non-judgement/not looking for something
	+ transparencies
- could there be a period of training (involving experience sampling) 
- it would be worth finding out how much tuning people to not be concerned with understanding/getting it right/etc might make any difference (in both trained and untrained groups)
- what might we _judge_ as being better, or how might we judge difference? the kind of language used? their enjoyment of it? just qualitative -- how are the experiences qualitatively different?
- worth connecting with just how prevalent images are in culture -- Sally Dibb touched on this during [[embodied intelligence meeting notes]] (on Instagram for instance) -- see also early section of Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics re visual culture (plus TTV might have useful general references)
- could we engage with properties/experiences like openness, imagination ... ?

"mindful-movement practices and body-awareness-enhancing approaches" [@mehling-2020-if p.257] 

Although science and somatic practices have a somewhat troubled relationship , cognitive science and neuroscience are increasingly testing some of these claims. 

(including that which is published in the flagship Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices)

Curiously, somatically trained dance artists discuss and valorise somatic or body intelligence [e.g. @scialom-2020-thinking; @rimmer-piekarczyk-2018-selfsomatic]. 

- or use embodied intelligence as catch all? Sally: "I'm still wrestling with whether we need to be able to understand or 'label' it in some way. I suppose this would become more important if the project moved onto to consider how this understanding might be used/translated into some kind of output, e.g., that might inform moderation."

- note also mention of embodied self-awareness in [@lamothe-2015-why.pdf] -- see p.212 and Alan Fogel's use of the term 

Eddy mentions Howard Gardner's use of term kinesthetic intelligence: Gardner, H. (1993), Creating Minds: An Anatomy of Creativity Seen through the Lives of Freud, Einstein, Picasso, Stravinsky, Eliot, Graham, and Gandhi. Also Polanyi's work is relevant here: [[we can know more than we can tell]]. See also <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15290824.2003.10387224>


- In science-informed popular press it's a thing: Roberts "The Power of Not Thinking", Murphy-Paul "The Extended Mind", Gallagher "How the Body Shapes the Mind"; Varela "The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience"
- the body plays a crucial role in shaping and directing thought processes. Embodied intelligence used in difference research contexts: cognitive science, robotics and AI, and philosophy.
- "the underlying principle is that intelligence emerges not just from the brain, but from the dynamic interaction between the brain, body, and environment" (chatGPT)
- builds on Varela, and enaction. 

and how such intelligence helps shape a lens through which the world is experienced . Yet it remains unclear what is meant by embodied intelligence and the extent to which it influences how one sees and engages with phenomena. 

_Transparencies'_ structure is fluid. It can be *performed* for one person as a focussed dialogue, or for a larger group of people with differing degrees of engagement. It is a bespoke experience for people. 

affective responses (including non-conceptual content) 

Since its premiere in November 2018 the work has been seen by about 320 people. 
Davies writes that she is "not looking to find meaning in this process – a meaning can bring solidity and I am looking for movement. I stop looking at the images and instead look through them to others and recognise other ways of doing, connecting, seeing, and appreciating." 

 plays a role in visually-based aesthetic experiences

> Enhancing body awareness may not be the main objective for all of these approaches, but it has been described as a key element or a mechanism of action by which they may provide health benefits. [@mehling-2011-body p.1] 

> A purported key mechanism of action in most mind–body movement approaches is the maturation and development of bodily awareness.[@mehling-2020-if p.254]

From a neuro-physiological viewpoint body awareness relates primarily to proprioception and interoception [@mehling-2009-body p.2]

fix next sentence == need to mention different naming conventions.
Scientific research into somatic practices such as body awareness [@mehling-2009-body], "movement-based embodied contemplative practices" [@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1], body awareness-enhancing therapies [@mehling-2012-multidimensional] and other "mindful movement practices" [@mattes-2016-attentional p.258] has attempted to verify the potential benefits of such body-based somatic practices, as well as potential mechanisms for change.
