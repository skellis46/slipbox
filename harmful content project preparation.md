# harmful content project preparation

_previous note:_ 

- aim: to adapt a practice research method (or 'artistic approach') for use in applied setting -- speculative
- for finding subjects, how do we assess their prior understanding, experience and feelings about harmful content online? 
- could the task be performed daily without supervision? then compliance is more of an issue
- or is it more that we are targeting labelling language? To expand that language? But do to that we need to know what language is currently used. 

- what are the assumptions we are making (particularly re TP and its potential use/value)?
- how do we choose images? and what kinds of images? 


- the problem of scale for tech companies. What if we 'find' that this process is incredibly useful for understanding experiences of HC? How would it be scaled up?  
- content moderation is impossible to do well at scale [@masnick-2019-masnick]
- as if what we are proposing is the precise opposite of an Amazon mechanical turk [[Melanie Mitchell - Mitchell-2019-Artificial#^586fbb]]
- as direct comparison with brittleness of AI??
- we are basically attempting to introduce a massive amount of friction into the system
- is there a way to build an online version of Transparencies -- something that automates transparency layer of images, and then makes them available on a lightboard/desktop online? 

- make clear link between interoception, body-based practices (mindful body practices): e.g. Gibson (2019) Also Mehling et al 2011 (readwise) (uses term 'body awareness practices), also Sze et al 2010 [@sze-2010-coherence]
- note in Todd and Aspell the maladaptive vs adaptive body awareness: "Maladaptive BA is avoidant, evaluative and linked to anxiety and other negative emotional states, whereas adaptive BA is accepting, non-judgmental and related to wellbeing."
- change in perception, perception of change 
- can we get access to how harmful content is currently labelled? this seems critical -- that is, what is the status quo (linguistically but also re conditions created, etc)?
- Millman et al (2020) covers DMT and is a useful note about role of movement/body in therapeutic situations. 

> The job of the annotator often involves putting human understanding aside and following instructions very, *very* literally — to think, as one annotator said, like a robot. It’s a strange mental space to inhabit, doing your best to follow nonsensical but rigorous rules, like taking a standardized test while on hallucinogens. [@dzieza-2023-ai n.pag.] 

- perhaps the way TP work is more in the realm of tapping into noesis or noetic understanding as described in [[Ekua Hagan - What Are Noetic Sciences]] 
- [[noesis and noetic understanding]] -- foregrounding the subjective

## online safety bill 

- see [[Department for Science, Innovation and Technology - Online Safety Bill]] for a few highlights
- is there a clear working definition of harmful content? ("legal but harmful"). [OSB defines them](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-and-reporting-online-harms-on-your-online-platform) as:

> user generated content or behaviour that is illegal or could cause significant physical or psychological harm to a person.
> Online harms can be illegal, or they can be harmful but legal. Examples of online harms include (but are not restricted to):
> - child sexual exploitation and abuse
> - terrorist use of the internet
> - hate crime and hate speech
> - harassment, cyberbullying and online abuse

- Of these online harms we seem to be dealing more with child sexual exploitation and possibly hate crime and hate speech. Perhaps what we are doing is more general than this. That is, it's about the nature of looking at images more broadly. Certainly, the focus of the OSB is protecting children. Work by [[Balfour - Postdigital Intimacies for Online Safety]] is useful here. 

- ofcom comment:
> We know that many services already take measures aimed at protecting their users. Most services have terms of service that prohibit sharing of harmful or illegal content, and moderate content in response to user complaints. Some services use sophisticated automated content detection tools. [@ofcom-2022-online p.3]

And this is very useful from ofcom (same statement as above, p.4):

> But almost all online harms are complex and multi-faceted, and require similarly complex, multi-faceted solutions. We will work with relevant stakeholders to build shared understanding and identify opportunities to collaborate to develop new approaches and, if relevant, standards [@ofcom-2022-online p.4].

Noting that Ofcom's online safety regime includes: 

> Empowering adults to protect themselves from legal but harmful content [@ofcom-2022-online p.13]
- again the question of who are the stakeholders in this project? Note that this part of Ofcom plan only involves Category 1 services only (user-to-user generated content like in social media)

## some questions

- [ ] two sets of key stakeholders: annotators and end users? perhaps also people in tech companies who are adjusting algorithms based on labelling? Not sure this is correct -- really our key stakeholders are harmful content annotators -- need to discuss this (see note above from p.13 of Ofcom report)
- [ ] how do we make it so it's sufficiently AHRC-like? 
- [ ] what's the link to the law -- is it more than relation to the [Online Safety Bill](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/a-guide-to-the-online-safety-bill)? 
- [ ] interoception is part of this speculation because of its plausible connection with embodiment (Herbert and Pollatos, 2012 - I first saw it in Millman, 2021) and emotion [see for instance @sze-2010-coherence]. ([[body awareness and emotion]] [[emotion, affect and internal bodily awareness]]) But, what kind of task is transparencies? does it dig into the embodied? If not, then might interoception be a useful measure or concept for understanding looking at image or visual material. Or is it that we are asking people to pay attention when looking (to not get lost in thought). Like TP is a way to look at images: to complicate, to stimulate the imagination, to ask questions of what is being seen, etc??? 

## actions

- [x] add some harmful content materials to the zotero shared library
- [ ] law-based materials also to the library? -- ask Charlotte for best examples
- [x] add that annotating article (that I shared with Charlotte -- in readwise too?)
- [ ] look into Body Awareness subscale of the Body Perception Questionnaire (from Todd and Aspell, 2022)
- [ ] see RISE (reconnecting to internal sensations and experiences) from Todd and Aspell
- [x] is there any difference between mindfulness and bodyfulness exercises and effects? see Sze et al on this [@sze-2010-coherence] although their research sets dance 'against' mindfulness (and so depends on what kind of dancing). 
- [ ] -- ask Millman about this questions re body awareness and types of dancing? (and introduce myself) - and how many dance practices seem to merge with mindfulness techniques??? 


## regarding transparencies practice (TP)

- how do we deal with the question of how long it takes to learn somatic practices? (See Millman 2023). Is TP a somatic practice?
- HOW does Transparencies 'work'? on what levels? on what grounds?   
- do you think we might conceive of the transparencies practices (or versions/adaptations of it) as a somatic practice? (if yes, how? if not why not?)  
- must the practice happen in conversation? (I felt as if the practice was a stimulus for conversation -- as if the role of the work is to make conversations possible)  
- can it be done alone?   
- how much might it be stretched or adapted?   
- do you think you got 'better' at the practice over time? (you certainly got more experienced). If so, what is it that you were getting better at?   
- to what extent does the Transparencies process put people 'in touch with' their bodies (if at all)? Do you think of it as an explicitly (or perhaps implicitly) embodied activity?
- to what extent is TP a 'feeling' work vs a 'thinking' work? 
- do we imagine the participants describing what they are seeing AND their emotions? (that is, their response to what they are seeing). Noting that "the language we use to describe our emotions is associated with the underlying physiology" [@sze-2010-coherence p.804]

- seems like TP could be a mix of body awareness, mindfulness and emotional awareness ... (but of these body awareness would be least)?? 
- the question 'how does it feel?' (when looking at HC) could also be _where_ does it feel? 
- big question for me (ie have no idea) about how images work on us. 
- perhaps the combining of images confounds our predictive capabilities so that cognitively we start working more bottom-up?? 


## variables

### possible independent variables

- body awareness: skilled v unskilled (or is it just 'experience') (any measure of body awareness skill might be a proxy) 
- time -- improved understanding of the process/practice
- with and without transparencies approach -- same images? (singular vs dynamic?) -- this depends on what it is that we understand to be present or unique in TP -- and how to not have those things present in the 'without' group. 
- pre-process prep task (body tuning): dance exercise, basic movement exercise, somatic practice, none
- harmful vs unharmful content

- surely we should look at these pictures WITH and WITHOUT the transparencies approach? what kind of language is used? what is the experience like? how to do analysis of the language? could this be a within group variable -- same group of people looking at images, then looking at images with transparencies? but this implies we want to use this transparencies thing as an approach for others to use? Is this correct? But a lot also has to do with being in the body -- which means some kind of prep is necessary .... 

- both groups do preparatory activity? (could be both explicit body awareness and implicit dance exercise). Another IV becomes doing prep or not. another IV could be practice? (do they get 'better' at the prep activity?). 

### possible dependent variables

- content analysis of language
- self-reporting of various components (body awareness, interoception, )
- to what extent does the TP (transparency process) put people 'in touch with' their bodies? Is it an explicitly embodied activity? 
- body self-efficacy scale (also embodied intersubjectivity scale) (Koch) -- see appendices: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00508/full

- use measures other than self-report? 

- what does doing the transparency process do to interoceptive sensitivity (and/or accuracy)? might the practice alter sensitivity/awareness? 
- should we just monitor any changes to interoception, body awareness, etc over course of the research? 

- measuring effectiveness of body awareness things: 

> The incorporation of implicit neural, physiological and behavioural measures such as mobile electroencephalography (EEG), interoceptive awareness and accuracy (Schandry, 1981), proprioceptive accuracy (Jola et al., 2011) and time perception (Wearden, 1991; Orgs, Bestmann, Schuur, & Haggard, 2011; Orgs, Kirsch, & Haggard, 2013) could provide more control to current DMT research and allow for a better understanding of how DMT may work to target specific symptom reduction. [@millman-2021-towards n.pag.]

- ability to express one's emotions? (or emotional awareness?) e.g. self-report Toronto Alexithymia Scale (cited in Herbert and xx, 2012). Or:

> A performance measure, the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS; Lane, Quinlan, Schwartz, Walker, & Zeilin, 1990), is also well-validated. (Herbert and Pollatos, 2012)

- self-awareness? (e.g Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE))

## research design

- do we do an intervention or do we keep it far far more open? 
- need no-intervention control group??
- how we calculate sample sizes for between group analysis? 
- specific vs unspecific effects of the intervention (Koch et al 2019, cited in Millman 2021 n.pag.)

- simplest design would be 2 groups (transparency vs non-transparency), 2  body awareness level (skilled / unskilled)?? Mirror design of Millman, with flushing out period inbetween the two parts?
- or might it be 'unharmful' and harmful content -- kinds of differences?? 

## art-based components

- video essay (considering different audiences)
- participants take still images of their transparencies (with analogue camera?)
- series of audio conversations about the experience

## to discuss on 4 September

- introductions
- If Sue was coming on 4/9 she could talk us through (or show us?) transparencies
- update on Online Safety Bill -- what it is, what we need to know [CW]
