# the tech industry and good intentions

_previous note:_ [[Brown - Resisting AI]]

From L.M. Sacasas's Convivial Society <https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/to-hell-with-good-intentions-silicon> 

> I will not keep you in suspense. I am taking Illich’s blistering speech and, in earnest good will, offering it, by analogy and in spirit, to all of those who would today seek to do good in the world through the development of AI technologies.²

> That there are those in the tech industry who seek no good but their own profit, no one would deny. That there are those in the industry who seek to do good in the world, some might deny due to a cynicism that was perhaps not wholly misplaced. But I do not deny it. I know it to be the case. And it is precisely to those who seek to do good that I offer this Illichian provocation.

> But I am not Illich and thus not in the habit of speaking quite so stridently, and I have no interest in affecting the style for rhetorical effect. Nonetheless, I will venture this assertion in his spirit to those seeking to do good for the world through the development of technology:
> *I am not here to argue. I am here to tell you, if possible to convince you, and hopefully, to stop you, from pretentiously imposing yourselves on the rest of humanity.* – Ilyich

> As Illich puts it toward the end of this talk, “it is profoundly damaging to yourselves when you define something that you want to do as ‘good,’ a ‘sacrifice’ and ‘help.’” The implication here is that we are quite adept at deciding what we want to do, and only then calling it “good” so that we might feel better about imposing ourselves on others.

> In *Deschooling Society*, for example, Illich observed that “once basic needs have been translated by a society into demands for scientifically produced commodities, poverty is defined by standards which the technocrats can change at will.” “Poverty,” he adds, “then refers to those who have fallen behind an advertised ideal of consumption in some important respect.”

> It is then that he drops this devastating line:
> “Perhaps this is the moment to instead bring home to the people of the U.S. the knowledge that the way of life they have chosen simply is not alive enough to be shared.”

> If I were to become the ideal user of the technology you would have me adopt, would I be more fully human as a result? Would my agency and skill be further developed? Would my experience of community and friendship be enriched? Would my capacity to care for others be enhanced? Would my delight in the world be deepened? Would you be inviting me into a way of life that was, well, alive?

> Illich wrapped up his talk with these closing lines:
> “I am here to suggest that you voluntarily renounce exercising the power which being an American gives you. I am here to entreat you to freely, consciously and humbly give up the legal right you have to impose your benevolence on Mexico. I am here to challenge you to recognize your inability, your powerlessness and your incapacity to do the ‘good’ which you intended to do.”

> Part of the problem in the case of these Americans in Mexico is that they could not understand the language. But that is only part of the problem. The more significant issue is a deeper incapacity to listen to others not because you do not speak the language but because you have already decided that you know what is best for them. Then, convinced of your wisdom and goodness, you are prepared to impose your will on the other.
