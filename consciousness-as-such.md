# consciousness-as-such

_previous note:_ [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]

LLM (20251104): 
> Consciousness _as such_ refers to the immediate, pre-reflective awareness that underlies all experience—the pure appearing of phenomena before interpretation or conceptualisation. In phenomenology, it denotes the self-manifesting field in which subject and object arise together, rather than a property of the mind or brain. As Husserl described it, “consciousness is consciousness _of_ something,” a directed openness that constitutes meaning through intentionality (Husserl, _Ideas I_, 1913).

> Consciousness *as such* in phenomenology refers to the structure of awareness itself: the way experience appears through intentionality (consciousness *of* something). It still presupposes a subject–object relation, even if only as a phenomenological correlate.

> Nonduality, by contrast, refers to experiences or ontologies in which that subject–object distinction collapses. Awareness is not *of* something but *as* everything—there is no separate perceiver and perceived. In this sense, nondual awareness goes beyond the phenomenological notion of consciousness as such, dissolving the very intentional structure that phenomenology typically takes as foundational.
