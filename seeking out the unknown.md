# seeking out the unknown

Dear

This morning I woke up at 4:05am attempting to conjugate a particular Italian verb form. I tell you this with a mixture of pride and embarrassment. If memory serves, the sentence I was writing in my head was:

Se io fossi andato in quel ristorante la settimana scorsa, avrei mangiato la trippa.

If I had gone to that restaurant last week, I would have eaten tripe.

To be clear, whatever that restaurant was and if I were to ever go there, the chances of me eating tripe are as close to zero as is possible. What tidbit of neural detritus vis-a-vis tripe got stuck in my middle-aged grey matter? 

This is a roundabout way to say that I am in Rome and doing a lot of Italian lessons and study each day. I feel full of the language (and the gelato) and the sensation of waking up like that was as if my body was attempting to process so many abstract ideas that its only option was to wake itself up and get it out in the world (even if in silence).

The complex psychology of being a learner in a classroom is explicit here, even though I have been learning Italian some time now and am by no means a beginner. I am studying at a school called [Dilit](https://www.dilit.it/) and their teaching method is more or less to offer exercises and then give a lot of space to the students to figure things out together. Our common language as students is Italian, and as we discuss the materials in pairs, we come up with possibilities, come to understand what we don’t understand and make many many mistakes. The pairs change often within an exercise and each pair slowly starts to fill in gaps of understanding before there is an open conversation to ask questions of the materials. The method is playful, intense and full of surprises. It is also simple yet brutally effective and I like it a lot. 

When I say complex psychology I mean the intense mix of feelings that happen as an adult learner struggling to express oneself in another language when you are used to being able to express yourself with complete mastery in your own language. These feelings are mostly of vulnerability (not wanting to seem like an idiot), and intense frustration attempting to grind out words while expressing abstract and hypothetical ideas. I thought that these feelings would slowly go away as my level improved but I am not sure this is the case. In fact, if I had known at the beginning how hard it is to learn another language I am not sure I would ever have started. 

I have been teaching people in different contexts since I was 15 years old: first tennis, then biomechanics, then physical training, then dance practice and theory, and now doctoral students. What I think is vital about this experience of being a learner — and perhaps particularly in the context of learning a language — is to be reminded of what it is like to not know. To be uncertain. To stay with an activity and not let doubts cloud the mind. To stay on your own mat (as yoga practitioners say) while attempting to contribute positively to the classroom situation. Such experiences ought not to be taken for granted, even if occasionally the vulnerabilities are overwhelming.

I think what I am writing here (which is clearly different from the things I normally write to you about) is simply to acknowledge the profound pleasure of learning. That perhaps being human is really about being an organism that changes and grows by seeking out unknown, uncertain and difficult experiences.

Best I head out and avoid the tripe.
