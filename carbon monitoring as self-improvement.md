# carbon monitoring as self-improvement

_previous note:_ [[species narcissism]]

> Measuring ongoing patterns of carbon use and then adjusting those patterns in the future are behaviors of the same type as frequenting a gym, attending Weight Watchers, or reviewing a household budget. These tools share a family resemblance with genres of self-improvement and self-accounting, such as diaries and checkbooks, self-help manuals and lifestyle magazines. Calculators punctuate actions in the now that, in effect, make one a measurably “better” person.[@houser-2016-human p.149]
