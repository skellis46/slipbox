# trading zones for experiments and knowledge

_previous note:_ [[artists and scientists intervene in the world]]

---


>We can say that neither “the” scientific method nor “the” experimental method exists. What indeed exists is a plurality of scientific practices, but it is precisely this plurality that, at odds with appearance, brings stability and strength to the enterprise of science. Peter Galison has put forward the concept of “trading zones,” spatially located (laboratories) or virtual zones (networks of labs connected by the Web) where theory meets experiment, engineering meets theory, scientific subcultures meet each other, and “wordless interlanguages” are spoken (he calls them “pidgins” or “creoles”), which are embodied in objects and procedures.13 Knowledge moves across boundaries and coordination around specific problems and sites is possible even where there are not globally shared meanings. Meanings do not travel all at once in great conceptual schemes or “paradigms,” but partially and piecemeal. This picture brings with it important consequences for our idea of scientific change and the overall picture of science.[@garbolino_what_2013 p.81]
