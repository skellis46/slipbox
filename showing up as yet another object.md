# showing up as yet another object

_previous note:_ [[the act of perceiving itself coming to awareness]]


> Anything you can notice is going to be another object. And that doesn't mean that all those objects are actually the same object, it just means they are all objects. And if it feels like something to be a subject, that feeling is showing up as yet another object. [Jake Orthwein, in @taft-2023-few 18:17min] 

> The feeling of being me -- the body sensations and the emotions and the thoughts -- are just more "objects" that are appearing in the field of awareness ... [@taft-2023-few 18:57min] 

... when we see it that way everything is not separate in this field of awareness. And so that's the nonduality of subject and object.
