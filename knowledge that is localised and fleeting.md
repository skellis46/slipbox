# knowledge that is localised and fleeting

In _Adapt_ Tim Harford describes two historical scenarios predicated on collecting large amounts of data that are fed to commanders or leaders in order for them to make decisions. One is Project CyberSyn in Chile in the 1970s, the other is Donald Rumsfeld and the Iraq war in the 2000s. 

>CyberSyn was designed to bring problems to the attention of the President and his economic planners, but it succeeded only in reporting the issues that local factory managers wanted to report. Problems that they wanted to conceal, they had no difficulty in concealing. And when times were good it was hard to persuade them to telex any useful information at all, a state of affairs anticipated by Friedrich Hayek in an article published in 1945. What Hayek realised, and Allende and Beer did not seem to, was that a complex world is full of knowledge that is localised and fleeting. Crucially, the local information is often something that local agents would prefer to use for their own purposes. Hayek’s essay pre-dated modern computers, but his argument will retain its force until the day that computers can read our minds.[@harford-2012-adapt Chapter 1.9 ‘It was hard enough teaching computers to play chess']

This is telling -- the idea of knowledge that is localised and fleeting, and the desire of some parties not to share that knowledge.

_thoughts & links:_

- Harford here and McKeever in [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]] both call on Hayek's thinking, and McKeever's thought is that such local understanding or knowledge is not so far from the concept of standpoint epistemology. 
- the 1945 Hayek article is here: [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Use_of_Knowledge_in_Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Use_of_Knowledge_in_Society)
