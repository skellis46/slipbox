### summary

The article examines how kinesthetic awareness plays a fundamental role in contemporary dance. This "kinesthetic mode of attention" focuses on dancers’ internal bodily sensations, which guide and enrich their movement experiences. Through interviews with dancers and theories on phenomenology, the study highlights how dancers’ attention to bodily sensations enables exploration, problem-solving, and adaptability in dance. This attentiveness, often cultivated through somatics and versatile dance training, fosters a unique intelligence that supports dancers’ adaptability across various styles, linking kinesthetic knowledge to a broader, embodied understanding within dance culture. 

Ehrenberg’s discussion of Kinetic awareness relates to notions of consciousness in the context of dance (and briefly, specifically improvisation).
