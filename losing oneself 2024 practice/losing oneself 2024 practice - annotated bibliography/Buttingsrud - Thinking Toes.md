### summary

The article proposes a concept of "embodied reflection" within the context of aesthetic subjectivity, particularly focusing on dancers' experiences. It suggests that dancers engage in a form of self-consciousness that transcends traditional cognitive reflection, characterized by a deep, non-conceptual awareness rooted in bodily movement. This state combines elements of pre-reflective bodily absorption and reflective awareness, offering a unique perspective on the interconnectedness of mind, body, and emotional experience. The author argues for the recognition of this embodied reflection as a significant mode of understanding and experiencing art and aesthetics. (Chat GPT)

While this article does not explicitly mention improvisation, it deals with notions of embodied consciousness and overlaps implicitly with many of the ideas explored in relevant texts which do deal specifically with improvisation.
