### summary

The article explores the deep connection between movement and thought in dance improvisation, arguing against the traditional separation of mental and physical activities. It highlights how dancers engage in a form of embodied cognition, where thinking is not an abstract, language-based process but is instead intertwined with movement. Through improvisation, dancers navigate and create within their environment, utilizing movement as a direct form of inquiry and expression. This approach challenges conventional understandings of cognition, emphasizing the role of the body in generating knowledge and understanding through dance. (ChatGPT)

within Sheets-Johstone’s framework, dance improvisation is a particular mode or quality of thinking in movement. She describes its features such as a non-separation of thinking/doing or perception/movement, existing in a dynamic, ‘perpetually moving present’.

With regards to a sense of non-duality, she writes ”There is an ambiguity about my moving, a dissolution of my movements into my perpetually moving present and a dilation of my perpetually moving present in my movements” (Sheets-Johnstone, 1981, p 405).
