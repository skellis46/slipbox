### summary

The article by Serena Massimo, "Let the motion happen," explores how dance emerges from a felt-bodily relationship with the world. Drawing on the notion of emergence by Erika Fischer-Lichte, the text delves into how dance manifests through movements that are both spontaneous and learned but not simply mechanical skills. Utilizing Hermann Schmitz's theory, Massimo emphasizes how dance movements arise from the mutual affective influence between dancers and their surroundings, facilitated by the dancers' state between awareness and unconsciousness. The concept of "kinaesthetic attention" and the state of grace are key, highlighting how dance movements evolve from the dynamic relationship between the dancer and the environment, creating an experience of "pure presence" where the dancer feels simultaneously in control and carried by the movement.

Note that this article does not explicitly state its concern with improvisation practice, although it is implied in the frequent use of the terms 'emergent' and 'spontaneous', and by its citing of several dance improvisation texts.
