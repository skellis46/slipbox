Fraleigh draws on phenomenology to emphasize the importance of first-person, experiential accounts of dancing in understanding an embodied model of consciousness, particularly as a foundation for somatic movement explorations and improvisation. Fraleigh discusses consciousness in relation to other fields, such as Damasio’s concept of 'core consciousness,' and often uses 'awareness' and 'consciousness' interchangeably.
