### summary

The article delves into the phenomenology of the body schema in contemporary dance, particularly through the "Gaga" practice. It critiques and expands upon the distinction between body schema and body image as outlined by Gallagher, exploring how contemporary dance, especially Gaga, actively engages with and transforms dancers' body schemas. This practice underscores the capacity for dancers to develop an acute awareness of their body's habitual patterns, offering a new perspective on the embodiment and cognitive science fields. Through Gaga, dancers are encouraged to explore and reconfigure their movement habits, illustrating the dynamic and reflective relationship between body schema and conscious experience in dance.
