### summary

The article delves into the nuanced interaction between thought and automaticity in expert performance, specifically within the realms of sports, dance, and music improvisation. It challenges the notion that expert action relies solely on automatic processes, devoid of conscious thought. By examining the concept of being "in the flow," it posits that expert performance embodies a state of non-conceptual awareness, where actions are neither purely automatic nor fully deliberative but are instead characterized by spontaneity and a deep engagement with the present moment. This state represents a unique form of skilled coping that transcends the dichotomy between thought and automaticity, offering a richer understanding of expertise. (Chat GPT)

The discussion of actions which are not purely automatic nor fully deliberate reminds me of the notion of ‘dark and bright consciousness’ mentioned by Yuasa Yasuo in his book “The Body: Towards an Eastern Mind-Body theory”. He uses this notion as a way to talk about embodied cognition from an eastern perspective in relation to Western divisions of mind and body.
