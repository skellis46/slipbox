### summary

Broadly, This article explores the intersection of geometry, embodied cognition, and choreographic praxis in contemporary dance. It examines how choreographers use mental imagery and digital technologies to structure movement, drawing on cognitive sciences and phenomenology. (Chat GPT)

an aspect of the article specifically relevant to this research project is the discussion of internal feedback loops in the context of the creation of movement material in dance. It explains how dancers are often given tasks, games, or scores derived from conceptual frameworks to solve or apply during the choreographic process. This approach generates internal feedback loops as dancers interact with the conceptual prompts and adjust their movements in response. Although the specific details on internal feedback loops were not directly quoted, the mention of using conceptual tasks in dance creation suggests a cyclic process where dancers' responses to these tasks create a continuous loop of action and reflection, enhancing the creative process. (Chat GPT)

While it speaks more to ‘generating choreographic material’ than to processual, improvisational contexts, the description in this article of kinaesthetic images acknowledges an affinity with somatic approaches and speaks to a feedback loop between sensation and movement. It describes a specific and intricate approach to this feedback loop which is a part of Ando’s choreographic method. It seems that the notion of a feedback loop tends to be associated with digital technologies when it comes to dance practice/processes.

I find the use of the term ‘mental imagery’ in this article restrictive/misleading, in that it distances the article’s content from sensorial or bodily processes. The authors clarify that in the context of choreographic practice, they mean it to include a broad range of perceptual layers which later they later describe more accurately as kinaesthetic images. (”We do not use the word ‘image’ to refer solely to the visual sensory modality, as the name might suggest.” p.186)
