### summary

This article explores "No mind," a concept in Zen Buddhism, relating to deeply embodied consciousness during movement. It discusses how embodied consciousness has been historically significant in Zen Buddhist philosophy, suggesting true embodiment as an enlightened state where consciousness transcends mental and physical dichotomies. Through examples from Nihon-buyo, eastern martial arts, and Butoh, it illustrates movement practices as meditative processes towards self-world transcendence. The paper also considers the neurophenomenology of deeply embodied consciousness, emphasizing its scientific relevance and potential contributions to understanding consciousness and attention.
