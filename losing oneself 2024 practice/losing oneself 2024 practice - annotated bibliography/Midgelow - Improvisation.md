### summary

The article discusses how improvisational dance can integrate dramaturgical thinking, traditionally used in theater production, to enhance the creative process and performance. It describes a workshop where dancers engage in various activities designed to develop their dramaturgical consciousness, blurring the lines between action and intellect, inside and outside, past and present. These activities help dancers become more aware of their movements and choices in real-time, encouraging a synthesis of spontaneity and structured thinking. This approach allows dancers to explore memory, perception, and composition deeply, contributing to a richer, more nuanced improvisational performance. (Chat GPT)

Without defining them, mentions generally 'modes of attention or dispositions' and awareness

Midgelow notes that improvisation favours “embodied, inside perspectives that value the subjective and experiential,” and opens the question of what can be attended to in improvisation. She extends it to include a process-oriented, embodied dramaturgy.

She describes her workshop which aims to 'develop the dancer’s critical attentiveness'
