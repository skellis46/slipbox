### summary

This chapter acts as an overview of phenomena and reports by a number of experienced improvisers, collected by verbal recording during improvisation sessions and described/summarized by De Spain here. He treats it as a “mapping and understanding of improvisation process,” specifically in the context of Improvising as an end in itself. Some of the terms and ideas covered include “improvisational awareness”, internal vs. External awareness of oneself, presence, continual cycle of sensing to moving, relationship between self and improvisation material, intentions and ownership of intensions (an improviser's sense of their dancing as passive/active).

- Note: De Spain cites Csikszentmihalyi's flow in reference to a model for his method of “in the moment” data collection, but doesn't go into the content of this notion
