### summary

The article discusses improvisational artistry in live dance performance, emphasizing the concept of embodied and extended agency. It explores how dancers' spontaneous actions during performance reflect both conscious artistic choices and instinctual responses, shaped by their training and the immediate environment. The discussion integrates Clark's theory of the embodied and extended mind, suggesting that dancers' improvisational skills involve a complex interplay between cognitive processes and physical movement. This perspective challenges traditional views of dance improvisation, highlighting its role as a dynamic and integral component of artistic expression in dance. (Chat GPT)

Note that Bresnahan describes the term improvisational artistry as “that sort of thinking-while-doing that all dance performers engage in” (Bresnahan, 2014, p. 85). 

She uses the term ‘agency’ throughout the article, with the comment that she doesn’t quite assert this kind of physical practice as ‘mind’ or ‘thought’… although she looks at improvisation through the lens of Clark’s theory of the embodied and extended mind. She writes, ”On this view, ‘mind’ (1) is not reducible to brain and (2) is the locus of thought that is constrained and enabled both by bodily and environmental processes that occur in a context in which these processes interact in a symbiotic relationship” (Bresnahan, 2014, p. 88). Without naming it, Bresnahan hints towards the notion of nonduality.
