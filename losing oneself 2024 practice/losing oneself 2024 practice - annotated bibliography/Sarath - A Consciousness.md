### summary

This chapter examines improvisation through a consciousness-based lens, contrasting it with composition by focusing on their temporal and phenomenological differences. It argues that improvisation is not merely rapid composition but involves a fundamentally different experience of time and consciousness, leading to transcendent experiences akin to meditation. Improvisation fosters an immediate, non-linear engagement with the present, which contrasts with the linear, expansive temporal orientation of composition. This distinction is essential for understanding the unique creative processes and experiences associated with each practice. The discussion extends to broader implications, suggesting that improvisation could offer valuable insights for global challenges by fostering a more interconnected, responsive societal mindset.

Sarath cites Csikszentmihalyi's 'Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience' early in the article and aims to look at the mechanisms of improvisation which lead to jazz musicians' experience of the features of flow — “*heightened clarity, self-awareness, mind-body coordination, well-being, noetic sense, ease of execution of tasks, transformation of time perception, and communion with surroundings” (Sarath, 2014, p. 132)*
