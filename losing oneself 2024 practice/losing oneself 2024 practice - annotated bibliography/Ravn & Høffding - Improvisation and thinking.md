### summary

The document explores how improvisation in dance and music intertwines with the concept of "thinking in movement," challenging traditional views that emphasize spontaneity. By integrating enactive theories of agency, it examines the improvisational practices of a dancer and a musician, showing how these practices oscillate between controlled and spontaneous actions. This nuanced approach reveals improvisation as a skilled, relational, and context-dependent practice, rather than merely intuitive or unplanned action. (chatGPT)

This text may relate to nonduality in its discussion of agency, looking at the improviser’s experience  in dance improvisation between “*mental and bodily control and, indeed, a more spontaneous* ’*letting things happen’” (*Ravn & Høffding, *2021, p. 517)*
