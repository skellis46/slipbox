### summary

The article discusses the integration of somatic practices into dance improvisation, highlighting how these methods foster a deep, bodily knowledge that enhances both the dancer's and the viewer's experience. Through phenomenological exploration—understanding through the lived experience—the piece delves into the embodied process of improvisation, which blurs the boundaries between thinking and doing. This approach allows dancers to explore their internal perceptions and the external acknowledgment of these experiences, thus enriching the creative output and understanding of dance as a form of embodied research and knowledge.
