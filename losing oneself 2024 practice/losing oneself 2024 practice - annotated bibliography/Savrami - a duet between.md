### summary

The article delves into the relationship between dance improvisation and cognitive science, exploring how the kinesthetic experience and creative process in dance can be analyzed through the lens of the theory of enaction. It examines the role of embodied cognition and neurophenomenology in understanding dancers' improvisational skills, suggesting a dynamic interplay between mind, body, and environment. The study questions the sufficiency of enaction theory in fully capturing the essence of dance improvisation and proposes a more comprehensive exploration of consciousness and movement to enhance our understanding of dance education and practice.

Further, chat GPT contextualizes enaction theory in this context as “examining how a subject of perception creatively aligns actions with the situational demands. Originating from the work of Maturana and Varela, it views human perception and action as unified cognitive forms, emphasizing the coupling of our living praxis to a world filled with regularities shaped by our biological and social histories. This theory helps to understand our relationship with the world and others within the continuous process of living, highlighting the inseparable connection between perception, cognition, and the environment. It challenges traditional cognitive science by promoting a view where cognition is not just brain-centered but deeply intertwined with embodied action and environmental interactions”

This article looks specifically at the context of dance improvisation when thinking about notions of embodied cognition, and seems to point to a sense of non-duality in it’s mention of action, perception and environment as being intertwined.
