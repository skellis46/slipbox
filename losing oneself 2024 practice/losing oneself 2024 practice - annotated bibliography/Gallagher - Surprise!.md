### summary

The article contrasts two theoretical frameworks—predictive processing (PP) and enactivism—in explaining improvisation in performance, like jazz and dance. PP, which views the brain as minimizing surprise to maintain stability, struggles to account for the novelty and surprise inherent in improvisation. In contrast, enactivism, emphasizing embodied cognition and the integration of brain, body, and environment, better captures the dynamic and unpredictable nature of improvisational creativity. The article argues that enactivism's approach to cognition, considering habits and the potential for novelty, offers a more accurate model for understanding improvisational practices. (Chat GPT)

Gallagher discusses two neurocognitive theories in order to consider what might be happening in embodied processes of uncertainty and action in dance improvisation. The article mentions work on affect and interception by Barrett and Bar in relation to predictive processing.
