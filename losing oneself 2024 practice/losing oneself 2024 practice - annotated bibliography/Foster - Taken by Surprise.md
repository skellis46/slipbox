### summary

This texts acts as Foster's introductory chapter to 'Taken by Surprise: A Dance Improvisation Reader.' Rather than making a unified argument, it gives an overview of aspects of improvisation and includes sections (she calls manifestos) on the phenomenological, historical, discursive, analytical, and epistemological. It is also a record of her keynote paper at the 'taken by surprise' conference in Berkeley California, 1994 in which she spoke and danced (both improvised and prepared) simultaneously. As such, it gives reference to the present moment of the talk and the improvisatory aspects therein.

Themes touched upon include the know/unknown, bodily thinking/mindfuness, spontaneity, composition, reflexive awareness, middle-voicedness, 'self vs. body,' embodied consciousness, agency, power, desire, and translation.
