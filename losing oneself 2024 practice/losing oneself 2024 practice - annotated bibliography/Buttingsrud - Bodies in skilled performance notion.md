### summary

The article explores the concept of embodied reflection in professional dancers, focusing on their unique form of consciousness achieved through intense bodily awareness and affective activity. Through interviews with dancers, the study reveals how this state of consciousness enhances their expert performance, allowing for a profound level of non-conceptual, bodily-based reflection and sense-making. This state is characterized by an attentive presence and a heightened capacity for understanding and responding to the complexities of skilled dance performance. (chatGPT)

- Noting use of word ‘state’ vis a vis consciousness (and how this clashes with nonduality conceptualisations.
- This article goes into ‘dance performance’ (as choreography).
- I wonder how unique this consciousness is (and are there really special kinds of consciousness?)
- Below is chatGPT’s response to question re what the author means by embodied reflection:

“Embodied reflection, as described by the author, refers to a state of consciousness where dancers, through their skilled performance, engage in a form of non-conceptual thinking and understanding through their bodies. This involves a deliberate and immediate bodily directedness that seamlessly integrates attention to the whole body, bodily feelings, the surrounding environment, and movements within it. Unlike conceptual reflection, which has a narrow focus, embodied reflection embraces the entire context of an activity, allowing dancers to reflect through their bodies in a way that is both attentive and nuanced. This form of bodily intentionality differs significantly from established philosophical theories, offering a unique perspective on reflection that is deeply rooted in the immediacy and fullness of bodily experience.”

- This seems indistinct from the kind of wide open awareness described in nondual sitting.
- note that this article is has a lot of useful materials and ideas but it doesn’t go deep enough. For instance, the use of the word ‘attention’ is not at all clear. And the certainty of the dancers about non conceptual work is barely believable — as if they stop all conceptual thinking. It’s simply not critical enough (and reads a bit like an advert for the specialness of dance). Even the concept of ‘presence’ is not really attended to. Or even how ‘flow’ seems to be simply assumed.
