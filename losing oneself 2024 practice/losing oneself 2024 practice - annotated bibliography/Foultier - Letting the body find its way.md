### summary

The article explores the concept of "bodily reflection" in skilled performance, focusing on how expert performers, particularly dancers and musicians, integrate body and mind during their craft. It delves into phenomenological accounts of bodily awareness, highlighting the distinction between pre-reflective and reflective consciousness in the context of movement and performance. Through examining various philosophers and dancers' experiences, the paper argues that a deeper level of bodily reflection exists beyond cognitive control, where the body leads the performance process, suggesting a nuanced understanding of expertise that includes the body's inherent knowledge and capacities.

Foultier’s text explores consciousness in skilled action and performance, within which she includes improvisation. She does this by drawing from Merleau-Ponty, Legrand & Ravn, Dreyfus’s theory of absorbed coping and Montero’s account of “cognition-in-action”. She mentions flow, citing Høffding, S. (2019). *A Phenomenology of Musical Absorption.*
