### summary

The article discusses dance improvisation through Authentic Movement (AM), focusing on using AM for personal exploration in improvisation to mitigate the impact of external judgment. It emphasizes the concept of the "inner witness" to foster a non-judgmental, open engagement with improvisation. Drawing on examples from a specific studio practice aimed at performance, it explores how discerning a positive personal interest while improvising can lead to a deeper, more authentic creative process, despite potential audience judgment. The practice aims to balance external perceptions with an internalized, supportive witness, encouraging a flow state in performance improvisation. (Chat GPT)
