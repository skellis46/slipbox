note: @Michaela — this is useful to include here but don’t go down ‘creativity and groups’ rabbit hole. It’s only the intersection with flow and improvisation that is most important for me.

### summary

The article investigates the flow experience in group dance improvisation, focusing on its impact on the creative process. Six dancers participated in an improvisation workshop, reflecting on their experiences and the role of flow in their creativity. Effortless attention and enjoyment emerged as key themes, with flow enhancing group cohesion and fostering a creative environment. The study confirms flow's positive effects on cognitive efficiency, motivation, and happiness in group settings. It highlights the importance of group dynamics, trust, and the unique challenges and rewards of improvisation in dance.(Chat GPT)

relevant features of flow experience discussed here include “effortless attention” and “attention-awareness merging,” where Csikszentmihalyi’s writing on a feeling of union with one’s surroundings (or non-duality) is referenced.
