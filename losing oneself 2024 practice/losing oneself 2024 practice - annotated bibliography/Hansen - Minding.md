### summary

The article explores how implicit and explicit constraints shape dance improvisation, using insights from cognitive science. It discusses how established patterns and procedural memories guide dancers, often subconsciously, limiting spontaneity. By incorporating explicit constraints like specific tasks or rules, dancers can consciously manipulate these patterns, enhancing creativity and control over their movements. This approach contrasts traditional improvisation, which emphasizes spontaneity and present moment awareness, suggesting a deeper interaction with both past experiences and planned future movements to enrich performance.

Hansen draws from improvisation practitioners & scholars, cognitive science and Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) to consider what conscious and unconscious factors shape the experience and outcomes of improvisation. She considers the subjective experience of improvisers and looks at improvised dances themselves (from a viewers perspective) to analyze the factors which shape improvisation.
