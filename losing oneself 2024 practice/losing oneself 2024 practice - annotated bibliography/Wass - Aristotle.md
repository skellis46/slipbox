### summary

This article explores the embodiment of the noetic cycle in solo improvised dance-making, comparing Aristotle’s concept of noesis (thinking and planning of work) with Husserl’s noesis (reception and translation of sensory information into actionable data). By analyzing solo release-based improvised dancing, it illustrates how each theory manifests in practice, demonstrating that improvised dance-making arises from the interplay of awareness and action. This concept provides a new theoretical lens for dance research, positioning dance as a medium for philosophical inquiry and expanding the understanding of improvisation beyond traditional training and aesthetic choices.
