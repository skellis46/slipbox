# the body is a gateway between consciousness and unconsciousness

_previous note:_ [[Harris - Interoception The Sixth Sense]]

Adrian Harris quotes Jennifer Tantia (a Somatic Psychotherapist and Dance Movement therapist). [She says](https://embodiedpathways.buzzsprout.com/1931957/13300184-listening-through-the-body-exploring-interoception-and-the-power-of-authentic-movement-with-jennifer) that the body “a gateway between consciousness and unconsciousness”, and that the key is to “really pay attention, start listening through your body”. 

I'm not at all sure about this and in particular the 'really paying attention' bit -- but how?
