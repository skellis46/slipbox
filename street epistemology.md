# street epistemology

_previous note:_ [[epistemology starts with fallibility]]

From podcast _Deconstructing How Minds Change - Michael Taft_: <https://youarenotsosmart.com/2023/09/14/yanss-269-deconstructing-how-minds-change-with-michael-taft/>.

They discuss street epistemology at difference stages and it wasn't so clear what it was. At 33:00min they talk about strategies for testing people's choices and decisions. Rather than ask "Do you agree?" or "Did you like it?", they ask "To what extent would you agree?" and then ask for a grade out of 10 (say). If the person says "8" they ask "why not a 7?". They describe this as the "Um well" moment (at least this is how I remember it) ... the "um well" moment is when we are asked to make sense of our experiences, feelings and opinions. Street epistemology.



Some books they mentioned:  
- Science of storytelling - Will Stor
- The storytelling animal - Jonathan Gottschall
- The art of storytelling - John Walsh?
