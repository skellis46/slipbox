# ecological momentary assessment

_previous note:_ [[losing one's self]]

> Another technique is to collect contextual data about lived experience such as through ecological momentary assessment, which does not rely on retrospective accounts and is thus less vulnerable to recall bias (Vartanian et al. [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12671-018-0995-z#ref-CR65)). [@krageloh-2019-phenomenological p.23]

Wondering about looking into this assessment -- what would that even be like while doing [[authentic movement]]?
