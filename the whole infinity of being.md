# the whole infinity of being

_previous note:_ 

> Words from Stapledon's _Star Maker_, the bible of my youth, lit up in a backwater of my brain. I hadn't thought about the book in decades. _The whole cosmos was infinitely less than the whole of being ... the whole infinity of being underlay every moment of the cosmos._ [@powers-2021-bewilderment p.268]
