# action is the foundation of thought

_previous note:_ [[language is post-kinetic]]

---

In _Mind in Motion_, the psychologist Barbara Tversky suggests simply that motion in space is the "foundation of thought".[@tversky_mind_2019 Prologue] It is a book about how humans think about space and how we use space to think. She describes the way in which we create stasis from the profound and constant movement around us; and that we do this in order to be able to use words and concepts:

>We change those moving things into static things so that we can act on them with our minds.[@tversky_mind_2019 Prologue]

Tversky reminds us that actions came long before language, and language was also preceded by thoughts themselves based on action in space. She uses this term _actions in space_ over and over again, and states unequivocally that our "actions in space change space, change ourselves, and change others."[@tversky_mind_2019 Prologue] 


_questions & thoughts:_

- relationship to Sheets-Johnstone's phenomenology of movement is clear  
- I haven't yet read enough of the book to get a sense of whether she is finding a way to rethink thought or to celebrate it
- it has me thinking about the way film works, and possible relationships to the haptic and touch in film
- [[internal and external attention]] -- thinking here about role of language and thought in somatic practices
- [[body of the film]]
- [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]]
- [[I move precedes I can]]
- [[Sheets-Johnstone - Why Is Movement Therapeutic?]]
- [[footfall]] -- on changing and being changed
