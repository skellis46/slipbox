# gestell and enframing

_previous note:_  [[device paradigm and focal things]]

---

Heidegger's concept of enframing -- _gestell_ -- comes from his 1954 book _The Question Concerning Technology_. It refers to the idea that human encounters with things (or resources) in the world are shaped in particular ways that change our relationship with that thing. For example, when we damn a river to produce electricity, the river is enframed as a power source and no longer a river. Heidegger states that enframing is not in itself technological:

>Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.[Heidegger, in @noauthor_gestell_2020]


_questions & thoughts:_

- compare with thinking on the _[[body of the film]]_ where we can't see this _body_  but rather what it makes possible

_consider:_ 

- #toread Heidegger, The Question Concerning Technology
- [[noë - strange tools]] -- which is indexical zettel for Noe's book
- [[technology is skillful activity]] - outline of Noe's thinking on technologies as being part of how we are organised
- see [[future responsibility and stewardship]] and Jonas's book called The Imperative of Responsibility; and the demand for new ethics
