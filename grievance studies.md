# grievance studies

_previous note:_ [[standpoint epistemology and particular knowledge]]

---

This essay by Pluckrose, Lindsay and Boghossian outlines their work to discredit so-called _grievance studies_ disciplines (like cultural, queer, race, gender, fat, and sexuality studies). They worked with previous scholarship in those areas to then create a number of articles that passed peer-review and were published in various so-called grievance studies journals.


_questions & thoughts:_

- what is most curious (as a personal response) is how this project by PLB is damning, funny, unethical, rigorous and biased all at the same time.
- compare, for example, with the profound effects of [Wakefield et al.'s publication re measels, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism in The Lancet (1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield) 
- [grievance studies affair wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair): excellent summary
- see also the [Sokal affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair)

_consider:_

- while reading [this series of responses by 5 academics](https://quillette.com/2018/10/01/the-grievance-studies-scandal-five-academics-respond/) I happened across a comment that mentioned the work of [Andrew Sayer called Realism and Social Science](hook://file/nZn0qgxIU?p=c2tlbGxpcy9Eb3dubG9hZHM=&n=sayer-2000-realism.pdf). The comment -- by Owen Crankshaw (3 October 2018) -- is this:

>We DO need a philosophy of science that is an alternative to both postmodernism and positivism: A strong contender is critical realism. One of the best criticisms of postmodern philosophy from a critical realist perspective is Andrew Sayer’s Realism and Social Science (2000). If you find postmodernism lacking but are worried about endorsing positivism, you will love it.

- here's another comment in the [Quillette article](https://quillette.com/2018/10/01/the-grievance-studies-scandal-five-academics-respond/), this time by Farris, 3 October 2018:

>Whenever one falsely engages is scholarship, one can always be exposed by any work that mimics their own. Since these people are not scholars they fear being exposed and as such approve anything that appears similar to their output. They understand that if they call out any work similar to their own it is akin to calling themselves out or that others in turn might call them out. These are the properties of an echo chamber. They seek not scholarship but consensus. They seek to stifle debate because intuitively know their research can not survive scrutiny because in reality it lacks scholarship.

- the final response in the Quillette article is by English lecturer Neema Parvini. He writes this:

>Where some of us might see Niccolò Machiavelli, Francis Bacon, John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Rene Descartes, or David Hume palpably struggling with the deepest questions of political philosophy or epistemology, Cixious or Greene see only dead white men. What they say matters less to them than who was saying it. Thus, the competing systems of knowledge that came out of the Enlightenment – rationalism and empiricism – are both always-already tainted as “products of the patriarchy.” It has been the explicit goal of post-modernity to reject reason and evidence: they want a “new paradigm” of knowledge.

- it's curious how little I know about the enlightenment project, and the 'struggle' between rationalism and empiricism.
