# shrug

[[index -- artistic practice]]

---

What follows is a long citation from Berg and Seeber's book _The Slow Professor_. It was (and remains) the genesis of a gesture-based film project using 'shrugging' as some kind of symbol or action.

>Turkle, near the end of her book [Alone Together], shares her dismay at seeing someone text at a funeral. When she raised it with friends, “several shrugged. One said, ‘What are you going to do?’” She goes on to say, “A shrug is appropriate for a stalemate. That’s not where we are. It is too early to have reached such an impasse” (296). One of us received the same response when raising the issue of texting at department meetings; a sympathetic colleague said, “it’s annoying, I agree, but what are you going to do?” What we need to do is talk about it. We need to attend to how we feel when someone does take the time to be fully present. Those instances of generosity and true connection can guide us to thinking critically about the current university climate’s toll on human relationships. As Turkle writes in her cautionary tale about the limitless and exciting potential of technology, “when we ask what we ‘miss,’ we may discover what we care about, what we believe to be worth protecting” (19).[@berg_slow_2016 p.76]
