# 20200827 - it's all imagined

>It’s all imagined; there’s nothing to teach. Where does the wind go on a still day? And the breath you just took—doesn’t it exist now only as pure imagination? You noticed the breath flowing into your nostrils, and when you don’t have any thought of a past, this is the first breath that has ever been breathed, and now it’s gone. How can you know that it ever happened at all?

-- Byron Katie, A Mind at Home With Itself (Chapter 7, At Home in the Ordinary)

possible as voiceover

Also from same book:

## 6 MIND IS EVERYTHING, MIND IS GOOD

>And when you get out of the van and walk, you feel that with every step you might fall through the slats of the universe forever, as if you were falling through the empty space between the atoms in the sidewalk. 

- a film of falling 

>And still the next step comes, and the next, and it’s all happening by itself. But you’re not even looking over the edge, you’re falling over the edge with every step. Yet you don’t ever fall, and you continue to learn that falling is not possible. And that’s amazing. So the not-knowing and the amazement are totally intertwined.

>Eventually, through practice, you no longer impose your thinking onto reality, and you can experience everything as it really is: as pure grace.
