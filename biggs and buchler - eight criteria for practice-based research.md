# biggs and buchler - eight criteria for practice-based research

_previous note:_ [[art practice and artistic research]]

---

In this article Biggs and Büchler attempt to delineate the nature of PbR -- practice-based research -- by developing a "set of criteria that can be used to delimit the boundaries of research and to identify cases."[@biggs_eight_2008 p.16] In doing so they are attempting to identify what is different or unique about the research done by artists and designers that would "justify the existence of a distinct label such as PbR."[@biggs_eight_2008 p.6] 

Their criteria are divided into two parts. The first are four conditions common to academic research:

1. questions and answers
2. knowledge: and relevance of it to particular community (it's context specific) 
3. method: discussion of [[connection between question, answer and method]]
4. audience: description of [[specialist and generalist audience in practice-research]]

Biggs and Büchler then name four additional discipline-specific criteria:

1. role of image and text: :"PbR-ers need to find a necessary and sufficient role for such parts in their research"[@biggs_eight_2008 p.13]
2. relationship of form and content: "what would be lost if a non-traditional form were not used, i.e. if the content of the non-traditional academic thesis were presented in the traditional form."[@biggs_eight_2008 pp.14-15]
3. function of rhetoric: "constituting things through language"[@biggs_eight_2008 p.15]
4. function of experience: they take a sceptical attitude towards practice-research's historic emphasis on the value and importance of experience
