# _Transparencies:_ _Feeling Through Images_

Proposal for AHRC Curiosity Award

_previous note:_ [[somatics-body-awareness-transparencies project]]

## Summary

**This paragraph is not a part of bid but was used in developing relationships with industry partners.**

_Transparencies: Feeling Through Images_ is an exploratory research project centred on the image-based artwork "Transparencies" by renowned British choreographer Siobhan Davies. We will examine the potential of Davies’ artwork to reduce the harmful effects of online images in which the body plays a central role, including eating disorders, body dysmorphia and digital addiction.

## Summary (500 words, what you want to do) 500/500 words

_Transparencies_ (2018) is a participatory image-based art practice pioneered by choreographer and dancer Siobhan Davies. It involves layering and juxtaposing semi-transparent images to elicit body-based feelings in participants.

The practice has aspects in common with image-focused research methods such as photo elicitation and photovoice, but its focus on the body while moving and viewing images makes _Transparencies_ distinctive. However, the nature of the felt responses of participants in _Transparencies_ is not well understood, and nor are their potential real-world benefits.

We will examine _Transparencies_ practised _in situ_ with somatically trained participants by gathering rich qualitative data that describe the participants’ felt responses to the experience. Then, we will use this analysis to dialogue with industry partners and explore how the project’s focus on the felt sense while working with images could increase understanding of the role of the body in addressing critical real-world issues. These are issues in which online images and body perception and awareness are integral; for example, body image and eating disorders, digital addiction and the impact of social media on mental health (Haidt 2024).

We have two objectives:

1.     _Understanding Transparencies:_ To identify key themes and patterns in participants’ experiences with the art practice _Transparencies_ using practice-research and qualitative methods including interviews, film, audio recording and group reflection. How might these experiences help us understand the role of the body in viewing and working with images?

2.     _Potential real-world applications:_ To collaborate with industry partners to consider how understandings from Objective 1 can inform strategies for responsible online practices in marketing and content moderation, especially re issues relating to body image.

A multidisciplinary team of academics from dance, cognitive neuroscience and data driven marketing and consumer behaviour will oversee the research process. The academics will collaborate with non-HEI partners that work on the negative consequences of images served for human consumption.

We will produce six outputs that build on the two project objectives and that share the outcomes of the research with diverse stakeholders:

 i)     Video essay that synthesises the data analysis, impact report and speculative discussions regarding the utility of the data to address body-related issues created by algorithmically served images online.

ii)         Open-access report on the discussion with the project’s expert non-HEI industry partners with initial recommendations for future industry practices.

iii)     Dissemination at conference (aiming for World Conference on Qualitative Research).

iv)     Co-authored peer-reviewed paper examining the interactions between the felt-sense and images arising from _Transparencies_ and the potential of _Transparencies_ as a future research method (targeting _Qualitative Inquiry_).

v)     Lexicon of the ineffable: a corpus of language reflecting aspects of the _Transparencies_ experience for participants that fall between the felt and the articulated. The words that hint at, or reach towards, difficult or impossible to describe feelings.

vi)     Website with an open-access repository of data (subject to consent).

The project will benefit academics across a range of disciplines including dance, psychology, marketing and neuroscience by drawing together for the first time the embodied understandings of dance research and practice with image-focused inquiries.

## Vision (500 words, articulate why this is important) 498/500 words

In today’s world we are flooded with digital images chosen by algorithms. Our vision is to foreground the importance of using body sensations and experiences to understand and navigate this visual terrain.

As a first exploratory step towards meeting that vision this project proposes an in-depth investigation and analysis of _Transparencies_ (2018) – a participatory art practice pioneered by choreographer and dancer Siobhan Davies. _Transparencies_ involves juxtaposing and layering semi-transparent images, and through the dialogic process Davies draws attention to sensations and feelings in the body and how these are influenced by experiences of the visual phenomena.

_Transparencies_ is not a research method but coincidentally has aspects in common with photography-based research methods like _photo elicitation_ and _photovoice_. Whereas such methods focus on the role of images to produce meaning for participants, _Transparencies_ is a practice which produces novel responses from arranging and rearranging images while paying attention to one’s own body.

We are curious about two things. First, we seek to understand the experiences of participants in _Transparencies_ when used as an art practice and reveal the _felt senses_ elicited by the practice. Felt sense is a term coined by Gendlin to describe “the body's sense of a particular situation” (1981, p. 10). Second, we will explore the potential real-world applications of _Transparencies_ by collaborating with industry partners who focus on the negative impacts of online images in body image and eating disorders, digital addiction and mental health. By drawing attention to embodied felt senses through the process of looking at images in _Transparencies_ our collaboration with industry partners will explore how the practice and future adaptations of the practice might be useful for them in their vital and timely work.

The examination of the _Transparencies_ practice and subsequent analysis and findings will offer new perspectives to those researching the felt sense in dance and somatic practices. The work will also offer insights to psychology and neuroscience by focusing on difficult to articulate and measure ‘body-responses’ and analysis of ‘non-verbal' reactions to visual stimuli. The project will also interest stakeholders from the fields of mental health and well-being, for example those working with young people, or groups and individuals experiencing body dysmorphia/bodily disassociation, and particularly those that are negatively impacted by online images. The research will interest those researching and working in the digital and social media sector, including app developers, marketers and those responsible for maintaining ethical social media practices and limiting online harm.

The impact of _Transparencies: feeling through images_ lies in its novel approach to understanding felt responses to images, with potential applications in online psychology and adjacent research endeavours, and advancing understanding of embodiment in dance research. In future work we will use the emergent understandings from this project to adapt _Transparencies_ into a research method in different disciplines, by testing the utility of the practice beyond its limits as an art practice. These tests and potential adaptations are outside the scope of this initial exploratory bid but will be informed by its findings.

## Approach (1650 words) 1646/1650 words

### Approach summarises the previous work and describes how this will be built upon and progressed (if applicable)

In _Transparencies: feeling through images_ our exploratory approach combines qualitative and practice research methods to examine the effects and outcomes of _Transparencies_ as an art practice and explore its potential to help tackle real-world problems emerging from online images.

Borgdorff (2006 p.6) describes “interpretive” practice-based methods in which the art practice is the _object_ under investigation. We interrogate _Transparencies_ as the object of the research through Davies’ own practice research and integrate this reflexivity with conventional qualitative methods. In doing so, we explore the practice of _Transparencies_ from both first and third-person perspectives.

In developing _Transparencies_ as an art practice Davies drew inspiration from Warburg’s _Mnemosyne Atlas_ (started in 1927), an historical antecedent to contemporary photography-based research techniques including photo-elicitation, photovoice, visual ethnography, photo-documentation, autophotography and phototherapy. There is growing interest in these research methods and how they help researchers capture and analyse visual data, elicit rich narratives and perspectives, and engage participants in research processes in alternative ways. None of these approaches, however, focus on the embodied or _felt sense_ response to experiencing or interacting with photographs.

Felt sense aligns with contemporary neuroscience. For example, interoceptive awareness is the conscious experience of one’s own internal bodily states (Garfinkel et al. 2022) and it plays a key role in emotions (Barrett 2017) and self-awareness (Herbert & Pollatos 2012). Research on bodily awareness demonstrates how our sense of self is intimately tied to internal bodily sensations (Aspell, et al., 2013). This growing body of research indicates that interoception is a crucial interface between the body and cognition, reflecting complex neurobiological processes that shape our understanding of the world and ourselves.

### Approach uses a clearly written and transparent methodology

The art practice _Transparencies_ lies at the heart of our two-phase approach. Phase 1, _Understanding Experiences of Transparencies,_ takes the art practice as the object of our curiosity to explore in depth its effects and outcomes. Phase 2, _Potential real-world applications,_ involves a series of structured conversations between the project’s academics and non-HEI industry partners working in areas connected to the negative effects of online images. These conversations are designed to evaluate the utility of the data from Phase 1 in real-world situations in which the role of the body feeling and responding to visual images is vital.

#### Phase 1: Understanding Transparencies

Phase 1 aims to uncover more about the experience, process and possible mechanisms underpinning participants’ experiences. This Phase replicates the original practice of _Transparencies_ including the use of Davies’ images, while adding layers of reflexive practice research and qualitative analysis.

Davies will work with three people individually as participants in _Transparencies_. Participants will be purposively sampled from Davies’ contacts and they will have in common long experience in somatic practices. The goal here is to replicate the original conditions of the _Transparencies_ practice, and the small sample group will ensure richly detailed qualitative data and comprehensive analysis of these data. Currently, there is only anecdotal evidence of the effects and outcomes of _Transparencies_.

The objective of Phase 1 is to use first-and third-person qualitative research methods and reflexive practice research (from the position of Davies as the practitioner) to develop a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the practice. We will capture, collate and analyse the richness of how participants experience _Transparencies_ including their felt-sense of the practice.

##### 1.         Phase 1 data collection (4 stages)

_1.1: Practice of Transparencies_, guided/hosted by Siobhan Davies (Co-I), observed by Ellis (PL). The _Transparencies_ table is video recorded from above to reveal how the images are arranged and rearranged and the conversation is audio recorded. Other data pertinent to the research are gathered prior to data collection: primary demographics, bodily experience, use of social media, basic demographics.

_1.2: Semi-structured interview_ immediately following participation in _Transparencies_. The interviews will be led by Ellis and Dibb, with support by Davies. Questions will draw out the participants’ experiences and understand them in detail, and will focus on the role of the body and felt sense in their experience of the images. The questions will also help refine understanding of the practice through critical reflection. These interviews will be video and audio recorded.

_1.3: Semi-structured video recall interview_ 6 weeks after participation in _Transparencies_. Led by Ellis (PL).  Working with audio and video from data collection phases 1.1 and 1.2 and designed to reflect on and clarify experiences, record lasting impacts, effects, memories and associations. The time between Stages 1.2 and 1.3 will ensure that more stable and important experiences are documented. The sessions will be audio recorded.

_1.4: Group-based reflection_ (4 weeks after video recall) designed to gather any final understandings and insights from the _Transparencies_ process. Audio recorded and still images to document the session. The group dialogue will help the participants understand overlapping and diverse experiences of the practice, and create crossover thinking and reflections that will further enrich the data set.

All audio recorded in Phases 1.1-1.4 will be transcribed via otter.ai and then sense-checked by RA.

##### 2.         Phase 1 data analysis

At the end of Phase 1 data collection the complete data set will consist of: i) bird’s eye video of _Transparencies_ practice for 3 participants; ii) audio recordings of dialogue during the practice (between participant and Davies) synchronised with the video; iii) video and audio recordings from Phase 1.2; iv) audio only recordings from Phases 1.3 and 1.4; v) transcriptions of all audio materials.  

Thematic analysis of the data set from Phase 1 will enable us to distil concepts, ideas and language that appropriately and accurately reflect the experiences of the participants in _Transparencies_ and the nature of the practice itself. The research team will attempt to align subjective experiences with observable data (video, stills and transcripts) from the _Transparencies_ experience for each participant, to enhance the richness and applicability of the research findings.

Key outcomes from Phase 1: a) nuanced understanding of subjective experiences of _Transparencies_ with focus on felt sense); b) deep reflections and nuanced language that reveal the nature and possibilities of the practice as an instrument to modify human experiences of images; c) rich multi-modal data sets; d) summary analysis package as part of information packs for Phase 2.

#### Phase 2: Potential real-world applications

In Phase 2 we will harness the understandings generated from Phase 1 and seek to apply them in real-world situations in which the body and perceptions of the body are impacted by online images. The academic members of the team will collaborate with non-HEI industry partners – Be Real, Beat, Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous and Internet Matters – who work in the areas body image and eating disorders, digital addiction and the impact of social media on mental health. The academic project team and non-HEI partners will meet for three days of structured reflection and dialogue. Together they will determine how understandings from Phase 1 can be leveraged to positively intervene in partner programmes and materials addressing online harms underpinned by image hyper-saturation. They will also explore the potential ways in which _Transparencies_ might be adapted for future research and collaborations.

### Approach is effective and appropriate to achieve your objectives

The multi-method approach, balancing practice and qualitative research will build a comprehensive account of _Transparencies_ both as a practice and as an experience. These approaches deployed in Phase 1 will ensure nuanced analysis of the practice and elicit robust and rich accounts of _Transparencies_ as an art practice. In Phase 2, dedicated sessions with the project team including non-HEI industry partners will enable an expansive exploration of the utility of _Transparencies_ as a capable of creating experiences that address broader societal implications, as per the objectives. This mixed-methods design, combining empirical qualitative rigor with blue-sky thinking, addresses the stated objectives.

### Approach will maximise translation of outputs into outcomes and impacts

The iterative and collaborative approach, combining artistic exploration with rigorous qualitative analysis, will ensure outputs directly inform impacts. The website repository, video essay and industry discussion report will provide an evidence base underpinning the future potential of _Transparencies_ in key societal areas represented by industry partners. The lexicon of the ineffable and unspoken is inspired by Raymond Williams’ _Keywords_ (1976). It will seed further inquiry into felt sense aspects of human experience that resist description and will maximise long-term knowledge translation. Active dissemination via scholarly publication and conference presentation will amplify outcomes by embedding findings across sectors to enrich understanding of the societal relevance of felt sense in technologies saturated by images.

### Approach is feasible, and comprehensively identifies any risks to delivery and how they will be managed 

The two-phase methodology is contained yet robust and will produce rich data resources from participants experiencing and reflecting on _Transparencies_ with Davies and Ellis in Phase 1. These data will then be analysed and distilled by the RA and PL for the industry-focused discussions in Phase 2 that include the entire project team. The research methods are ambitious but feasible. Risks identified include the potential of poor data quality and difficulties in the multidisciplinary team. The risk of poor data quality will be mitigated through the iterative reflections across 4 parts in Phase 1. As regards relations between the interdisciplinary research team members, the members co-created the project which started in October 2023 with an in-person all day discussion and on-going editing and commenting of this document. Future in-person meetings and conversations within the team will begin with a movement session to reinforce the central role of embodiment in the project and to foreground trust and respect among team members.

### Approach describes how your team’s research environment (in terms of the place and relevance to the project) will contribute to the success of the work

The research environment at C-DaRE, with multidisciplinary expertise and a focus on somatic practices, offers an enriching artistic-scholarly setting essential for exploring Transparencies’ effects and potential real-world applications in our two-phase approach.

The project will collect personal data, including video recordings, audio visual material and interviews. We will follow an informed consent procedure underpinned by right to anonymity and right to withdraw. The PL will oversee the data plan. Data will be stored on encrypted Coventry University servers with automated backup. Data will be anonymised using unique identifiers and will be processed using secure and encrypted devices including on-site backup during Phase 1 data collection. Raw data will be retained for 5 years post-project, and anonymised data will only be shared with consent. All data protection processes will be documented and the processes will be reviewed after 6 months.

The project is centred on the _Transparencies_ practice of Siobhan Davies, an established white professional woman. Participants will be drawn from Davies’ contacts and they will have in common long experience in somatic practices. While neither representative nor inclusive we will follow this path because the purpose at this stage is to replicate _Transparencies_ as an art practice. Should we obtain meaningful results from this initial exploration, the next stage of the project will test the ‘method’ under conditions that are inclusive and representative.

The postdoctoral RA will be employed on a part-time contract for the length of the project and will be selected following an inclusive recruitment strategy. The role of the RA will be to observe and assist with data collection, analyse the data and prepare these data for presentation to industry partners. The RA will be line managed by the PL, will receive full RA training through Coventry University and will be included as a co-author in outputs.

We are aware that insights gained from the discussion with industry partners could potentially be misused for instance by marketing agencies to exploit end user vulnerabilities. We will develop clear guidelines for the industry partners on the ethical use of findings and will include ethical considerations in all outputs. We will work with the ethical framework required by the discipline with the most restrictive conditions, and approval will be obtained through the Coventry University ethical process. As regards ethical working between team members, at our first meeting we will establish a common ethical framework for working together which will be agreed by all team members. Ethics will be a standing agenda item for each meeting.

The project involves industry partners and team members engaging with potentially sensitive topics such as body image and eating disorders. We are aware that there is a risk of emotional distress or triggering negative experiences. We will ensure that we follow a robust informed consent process for this part of the project, provide clear information about the nature of the project, have a protocol for handling distress during discussion, and have built into the budget resource for counselling.

The project will adhere to GDPR compliance for data protection; ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management; FAIR Data Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) for research data management; Creative Commons licensing for open-access materials.
