# gaming chairs

Unhappy Theseus, doom’d for ever there, Is fix’d by Fate on his eternal chair.
—Virgil, The Aeneid, book 6 (trans. John Dryden)[^nicked]

In 1849 Thomas E. Warren designed the Centripetal Spring Armchair. It was the first chair to combine both wheels and swiveling[^warren] and it had a head-rest.

Apparently, it was so comfortable

Curious how Victorians thought less chair made for less movement: rigidity as moral practice. See Pynt


Chairs used by [gamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer) are more or less direct descendant of the Centripetal Spring Armchair. Have you ever seen or sat in one? They are rather extraordinary. Here's the _SecretLab Omega 2020_:

A review describes how it incorporates "that sleek, Mad Men-level sophistication with that SciFi gaming look."[^rev1] The chair also can be reclined so that "after a grueling gaming session" one can "just go straight to napping for a couple of hours without moving an inch."[^rev2] Bliss! 

The _Omega 2020_ is a modern-day throne in front of which lie the computer and its software as loyal subjects to their king. It is a chair that orients its inhabitant entirely ventrally (even if it swivels it's occupant is always facing forwards), as if other orientations -- or degrees of freedom -- must be curtailed.

Like thrones. Restricting movement. Particular kind of inertia. Focusing on eyes and hand movement.

The presence of ball-bearings in any part of this throne is almost entirely superfluous: the wheels, the central axis. It is a chair designed for pure stillness. It is an eternal chair designed to capture us. It is for fixity, for remaining. Escape is futile. Distinct from the promise of motion -- see Pynt and Higgs.[@pynt-2008-nineteenthcentury]


I understand that irrespective of the nature of our interests (I have zero reasons to judge gamers), we human beings want to be as comfortable as possible. A mountaineer sleeps in a high quality down sleeping bag, a serious runner wears clothes that helps her sweat more easily. 

Through constant or prolonged excitation of the skin, such chairs simply turn off https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor. mechanoreceptors: touch and pressure. To avoid stimulation of mechanoreceptors? (no evidence for this -- just an idea). Information from the body as a distraction. We respond to change. Homeostatic systems function like this. A continuous oscillation around an ideal state. The physiology can be met by the philsophical 

David Whyte's extraordinary book _Consolations_[^dw] is a type of glossary in which he asks us to reconsider our common understanding of the words of terms. In the section called _Run away_ Whyte writes how to "want to run away is an essence of being human" and that "it transforms any staying through the transfigurations of choice."[^dw2]

It is a chair in which our orientation to the ground [[to find a home in circumstances]] is lost or disregarded. It's a flying machine, a spaceship, a means of porting us into other worlds and then holding us in them.


Enough for now. I'm going to sit back on my haunches and hope my knees cope.

They are quite unlike any other chair, except perhaps for the ones that fancy footballlers sit in:
