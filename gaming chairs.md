One of the things these newsletters do is provide me with a chance to test ideas: putting thoughts and words together and seeing how they fit. This particular newsletter is definitely one of these experiments and comes on the back of various books I've been reading about exercise, anthropology, time, and the history of chairs. Yup, chairs.

I hope you enjoy it.

# gaming chairs

In 1849 Thomas E. Warren designed the _Centripetal Spring Armchair_. It was the first chair to combine both wheels and swivelling[^warren] and it had a head-rest. Apparently it was so comfortable it was described as immoral.[^jha] Those crazy Victorians.

Chairs used by [gamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer) are more or less direct descendants of the Centripetal Spring Armchair. Have you ever seen or sat in one? They are rather extraordinary. Here's the _SecretLab Omega 2020_:

Techradar's review describes how it incorporates "that sleek, Mad Men-level sophistication with that SciFi gaming look."[^rev1] The _Omega 2020_ is a modern-day throne in front of which lie the computer and its software as loyal subjects to their king. It is a chair that holds its inhabitant ventrally, as if all movement in the body must be curtailed ... except for the eyes and hands. It's a flying machine, a spaceship, a means of porting us into other worlds and then fixing us in them. 

I imagine how such a chair might, through constant or prolonged excitation of the skin, mute the body's [mechanoreceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor): touch and pressure -- as if information from the rest of the body's senses are a distraction, or we've forgotten that human beings respond to change. Change is how homeostatic systems function -- a continuous oscillation of corporeal 'data' within a narrow range. Such a chair deploys rigid comfort to deny our bodies movement. 

Seeing and reading about gaming chairs also reminded me of a chapter in  _Consolations_[^dw], the book by the poet David Whyte. In the section called _Ground_ Whyte writes the following: 

> Ground is what lies beneath our feet. It is the place where we already stand; a state of recognition, the place or the circumstances to which we belong, whether we wish to or not. It is what holds and supports us, but also what we do not want to be true: it is what challenges us, physically or psychologically, irrespective of our hoped for needs. It is the living, underlying foundation that tells us what we are, where we are, what season we are in and what, no matter what we wish in the abstract, is about to happen in our body, in the world or in the conversation between the two.[^dw71]

Whyte's ground seems absurdly different from the same ground that props up our _SecretLab Omega 2020_. But, of course, chairs don't normally hold us completely from the ground; they are a strange interface with it in which human feet (in most circumstances) are placed or dangling outliers -- the things that remind our tactile senses that the ground is still there.

I wonder how your feet feel when you are sitting: the way they conduct or transmit our bodily selves with the planet. Where do you feel them? Are they resisting or affording movement? Or might they even become the means by which you remember what geochemists call the _critical zone_: that thinest of thin layers of our planet where [all we have encountered exists and has flourished](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/24/pandemic-earth-lockdowns-climate-crisis-environment)?

Enough for now. I'm going to sit back on my haunches and hope my knees cope.

the anthropologist Gordon Hewes documented more than a hundred postures that humans from 480 different cultures adopt when they sit without a chair. Chairless humans often sit on the ground with their legs stretched out, cross-legged, or to the side; sometimes they kneel on one or two legs; and frequently they squat with their knees so bent that their heels either touch or come close to the backs of their thighs.[@lieberman-2020-exercised Chapter 3: Sitting: Is it the new smoking? n.pag.]

, keep us from being _on_ the ground. -- focus on feet here. Normally keep our feet. feet become the thing that is left on the ground. (often one foot if we cross our legs -- even under a desk)

> This thin matrix is what geochemists call the “critical zone”, the only layer of earth where terrestrial life can flourish. It’s in this finite space where everything we care for and everything we have ever encountered exists. There is no way of escaping our earth-bound existence; as young climate activists shout: “There is no planet B.” Here is the connection between the Covid lockdowns we have experienced in the past two years, and the much larger but definitive state of lockdown that we find ourselves in: we are trapped in an environment that we have already altered irreversibly.

> To come to ground is to find a home in circumstances, and in the very physical body we inhabit in the midst of those circumstances, and above all to face the truth, no matter how difficult that truth may be; to come to ground is to begin the courageous conversation, to step into difficulty, and, by taking that first [p.72] step, begin the movement through all difficulties, to find the support and foundation that has been beneath our feet all along: a place to step onto, a place on which to stand, and a place from which to step.[@whyte-2019-consolations pp.71-72]

The book is is really a glossary in which Whyte asks us to reconsider our common understanding of some words. 
I understand that irrespective of the nature of our interests (I have zero reasons to judge gamers), we human beings want to be as comfortable as possible. A mountaineer sleeps in a high quality down sleeping bag, a serious runner wears clothes that helps her sweat more easily. 

It is also a chair in which our relationship to the ground is lost or disregarded.

Different speeds relative to height on planet: 
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review (Chair makes us higher)

The presence of ball-bearings in any part of this throne is almost entirely superfluous: the wheels, the central axis. It is a chair designed for pure stillness. It is an eternal chair designed to capture us. It is for fixity, for remaining. Escape is futile. Distinct from the promise of motion -- see Pynt and Higgs.[@pynt-2008-nineteenthcentury]

The chair pretty much screams, "Now I'm ready to play! Up until now I was not." Escape is futile.

I wonder though if such a gaming chair is also the furniture equivalent of a leaf-blower. 

Curious how Victorians thought less chair made for less movement: rigidity as moral practice. See Pynt

It compels a particular kind of inertia in the way it seems to hold the body.

Like thrones. Restricting movement. Particular kind of inertia. Focusing on eyes and hand movement.

The chair also can be reclined so that "after a grueling gaming session" one can "just go straight to napping for a couple of hours without moving an inch."[^rev2] Bliss!

Security, certainty, fixity, immobility. Safety. Comfort. 

to "want to run away is an essence of being human" and that "it transforms any staying through the transfigurations of choice."[^dw2]
