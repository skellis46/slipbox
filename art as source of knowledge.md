# art as source of knowledge

_previous note:_ [[literature notes/Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature]]

---

In the preface to _Strange Tools_, Noë wonders why science and philosophy seek to explain art when art is "its own manner of investigation and its own legitimate source of knowledge."[@noe_strange_2015 Preface, n.p.] He suggests that whereas science is explicitly concerned with producing knowledge and understanding, art is for "bringing the world into focus for perceptual (and other forms of) consciousness."[@noe_strange_2015 Preface, n.p.] Art helps us to see, or to go from seeing to seeing differently or seeing more.


_questions & thoughts:_

- intriguing that Noë describes bringing the world into focus as the "character of the knowledge" of art

--- 

_consider:_

- Jenny Odell's [[habitual ways of seeing]]
- compare with Borgdorff's much more insular (or bubble-like) thinking about practice-research [[art practice and artistic research]]
- Noë's thinking (or at least this part of it) marks art as a practice as being quite distinct from a _focal thing_ [[device paradigm and focal things]]
