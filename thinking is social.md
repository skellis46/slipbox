# thinking is social

_previous note:_ [[action is the foundation of thought]]

---

_How to Think_ is a small book by the humanities professor Alan Jacobs of Baylor University. It's delicate and thoughtful, and seems to be a response to polarisation and "mob mentality". 

>This is what thinking is: not the decision itself but what goes into the decision, the consideration, the assessment. It’s testing your own responses and weighing the available evidence; it’s grasping, as best you can and with all available and relevant senses, what is, and it’s also speculating, as carefully and responsibly as you can, about what might be. And it’s knowing when not to go it alone, and whom you should ask for help.[@jacobs_how_2017 Introduction – Thinking in Action: An Example, n.p.]

This last part of the quote is at the heart of Jacobs' book. That thinking is fundamentally social; that we need others -- and need to be open to others -- to develop our ideas, to test our ideas, to reject them, to adapt them. That is, it's simply not possible to _think for ourselves_.
