# the slow violence of environmental destruction

_previous note:_ [[Brown and Reihana-Morunga - Hau]]

---

> We are feeling our way forward performing a benign rebellion against the slow violence of environmental destruction. Resisting the forgetting of air, we partake in political breathing. Nature courses through us.[@brown-2020-hau p.73]


_thoughts & links:_

- a benign rebellion!
- [[nature, art and habitat proposal]]
- it's just a beautiful piece of writing
- continued theme of forgetting and remembering; see [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]]
