# embodiment

_previous note:_ [[embodiment and emotions]]

This note is a placeholder for various things I happen across re embodiment. 

> Embodied cognition has a relatively short history. Its intellectual roots date back to early 20th century philosophers Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and John Dewey and it has only been studied empirically in the last few decades. One of the key figures to empirically study embodiment is University of California at Berkeley professor George Lakoff.
- from [[Samuel McNerney - A Brief Guide to Embodied Cognition Why You Are Not Your Brain]]

> Embodiment is the human experience of simultaneously having and being a body. The term conceptualizes the body as a dynamic, organic site of meaningful experience rather than as a physical object distinct from the self or mind. [@hudak-2007-unstable p.32]
