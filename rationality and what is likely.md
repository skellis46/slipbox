# rationality and what is likely

_previous note:_ [[noë - strange tools]]

---

In Chapter 5 (_Art, Evolution, and the Puzzle of Puzzles_) of _Strange Tools_ Noë discusses how science does not have a "worldview" (for instance, that God does not exist). Nor does science "believe in the reliability of science or, for that matter, in the reliability of human cognitive faculties".[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 5] Rather, Noë suggests that science is an expression of our rationality (not a belief in it), and that this expression deals quite simply with what is likely: 

>... rationality is not a lockstep set of rules and regulations stipulating what we may and may not think. It is rather the appreciation of the way our interests, knowledge, evidence, and concerns, our sense of “other things being equal,” shape what is likely, what is pertinent, what is useful, and what matters.[@noe_strange_2015 Chapter 5]



_questions & thoughts:_

- in #practice-research practice-research, given my interests, evidence (etc), what is likely? What are the other things that might be equal
- the kicker in all this is about recognising and understanding our interests and biases
- #finger-pointing-moon 
- writing from [[Lithium dancing]] edit bin: I also understand this writing to be an expression of rationality in the sense that I hope it reveals my interests, understanding, and concerns and how these "shape what is likely, what is pertinent, what is useful, and what matters".[@noe-2015-strange Part I, Chapter 5: Art, Evolution, and the Puzzle of Puzzles, n.pag.]

_consider:_

- [[epistemic rationality]]
- [[interpretation remains present]]
- [[rationalism vs empiricism]]
