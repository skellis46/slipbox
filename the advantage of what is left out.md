# the advantage of what is left out

_previous note:_ [[knowledge that is localised and fleeting]]

John McPhee's book _Draft No.4_ is about writing. In the section called _Omission_ he says this:

> In other words, the library at the Citrus Experiment Station had beguiled me so much—not to mention the citrus scientists, the growers, the rich kings of juice concentration—that I lost the advantage of what is left out.

McPhee is describing a situation in which he was so enthralled by a subject matter that he gave away the writer's advantage to leave things out.
