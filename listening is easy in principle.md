# listening is easy in principle 

_previous note:_ [[listening and curiosity]]

> Listening is easy, in principle. In practice it can be terribly hard – especially when, like Karen, you have so much to lose. A really good conversation is mentally demanding. Listening and responding is messy, exhausting – and exhilarating. A great conversation is a rare joy because it is full of surprises and thus requires constant improvisation. As the philosopher Gilbert Ryle wrote, ‘To a partly novel situation the response is necessarily partly novel, else it is not a response.’[@harford-2016-messy n.pag.]

> Miles Davis once explained his approach to jazz improv as creating ‘freedom and space to hear things’. The phrase is fascinating: not freedom and space to play things, but to hear things – what the other instruments are doing, even the sound of your own playing, and to respond. Any of us can have that freedom and space if we’re willing to listen. Whether we’re giving a speech, waiting on tables or sitting in a corporate call centre, the messier, improvised response is the one that takes in the entire context: the ambient noise, a customer’s tone of voice, the reaction of an audience, even the weather. Sometimes it’s only when a speaker delivers a line and sees the body language, hears the laughter or senses the sharp intake of breath that she instinctively understands what she must do next.[@harford-2016-messy n.pag.]
