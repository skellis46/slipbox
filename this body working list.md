This body is mine (Lee Miller, 20220108)

This body is ravaged (not destroyed). - Elizabeth Johnson, 27 Jan 2022
This body is tired and labile and exuberant. - Elizabeth Johnson, 27 Jan 2022
This body is who I am sometimes, mostly in relation to,  in service to others,  being valued by them – but it is my temple too, repository of Joy. And awareness, many times ignored, but only lately I realise how much I celebrate it. - Chris Keogh, 1 February 2022 (bizarts@bigpond.net.au)
This body is a potential carrier of something (Paul Paschal, 20220203)
This body is old and capable (ske, 20220203)
This body is the only body I have. But it is never only this body, in each passing moment this body is changed. (Lily Hayward-Smith, 20220208)
 This body tells me how I feel and what I need. It is supportive and curious. Sometimes it has to shout to get attention.(Lily Hayward-Smith, 20220208)
 This body wants to move with other bodies.(Lily Hayward-Smith, 20220208)
 This body made other little bodies!(Lily Hayward-Smith, 20220208)
 This body moves constantly between the private  and public. This body knows, adapts, makes do, holds, touches, connects to space, object, people. A life of navigating different ways of doing means this difference feels deeply organic in private, not interrupted by the obstacles of a world made for the standardised body, where the shapes cut out for bodies are whole, ‘normal’ sharing pace and action. In public this body is read as less, it is unexpected it disrupts assumption of what a body looks like, what it does. (Kate Marsh, 20220207)
This body raises questions, “what happened to you” this body is curious, “how do you do this or that”. This body in private does it’s own thing, moves slowly, taking more time, it does not need to perform normalcy, this body in private celebrates the beautiful adaptations and rewards itself for giving up what is not possible for finding variations in doing, moving, holding. (Kate Marsh, 20220207)
This body holds all the questions, the voyeurism, the tokenism in public this is an effort, this body has an armour that questions and stares bounce off, reflecting back into a world that doesn’t fit it. In private this body is whole, it is the body it was always meant to be, layers of meaning from years of living fall away, this body exhales, holds a mug in the crook of an elbow, feeling for texture, temperature with the end of an arm, eats with a glorious one fork choreography developed over years, unapologetic.(Kate Marsh, 20220207)

- This body is comfort, pleasure, anxiety, pain, intensity extraordinar(il)y  complicated and unconscious in its capacities — oh and aging! (Meredith Rogers, 20220223)
- This body is a bit niggly these days — there's the shredded tissue in the right heel; the sem-permanent swelling of the left ankle; the intermittent fault in the right hip and  the reasonably constant pain in the left shoulder But its really pretty strong and there are still so many pleasures present and remembered: its utter buoyancy in the ocean; the weight of babies on my lap and in my arms; the remembered pleasures of other bodies; settling into sleep —  heavy head on the pillow;  legs stretching between smooth sheets and then there's that muscle in the skull for thinking and loving; for feeling pain and all its many opposites (Meredith Rogers, 20220223)
- This body is my self, is my life, my being in the world, my permission to be in the world, my gift, my geography, my place, this body is the place I am it is not divisible from me yet will be this body is in time (and outside of time).  (Bagryana, 20220224)
- This body is not as solid as we think it is it has been in Mongolia and sat beside lake baikal and walked in the pine forests of Rila it is related to the Danube has been blessed to be with others to be part of others has been quiet at times has danced has moved in water is water I am earth and water (Bagryana, 20220224)
- This body loves to dive into ocean swells but not too deep. This body likes to move and also to rest. This body is home, sometimes it's been my only country. This body is migrant. It lives in more than one place. This body is a fiction. I, and others, make this body up. (Amaara, 20220224)
- this body knows pain, breathes life,  makes milk, feels conflict, carries trauma,  housed life and death and still radiates love. (Rosa Cisneros, 20220224)
- This body is [[compost for the future]]
