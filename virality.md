# virality

The following is a note from [[Lithium dancing]] edit bin. 
- should I talk about virality (that there's hope there). [[Blitz - Understanding Heidegger on Technology#^05e7db]]. It's still producing a virus (it just might not be a successful virus). 
- [[who could ever dream of such a thing?]] - about virus
- See (although only just related) also revealing but also challenging-forth in [[Waddington - A Field Guide to Heidegger#^e6b68f]]—it leaves me with a great deal of sadness. Note here: [[bringing-forth vs challenging-forth]]

> I think it’ll be useful to differentiate finding implications in this fast-changing social media world versus celebrating or glamorizing social media trends. Because what I also notice is that the life span of a viral dance video is really short!—Chuyun Oh[@harlig-2021-tiktok p.204]


Quest for virality. See [[Jacobs - After Technopoly#^cde1fd]] and also [[Blitz - Understanding Heidegger on Technology#^05e7db]]. Also Blanco Borelli and moore discuss virality a lot in their article [[Blanco Borelli and moore - TikTok, Friendship, and Sipping Tea, or How to Endure a Pandemic]].
