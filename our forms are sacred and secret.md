# our forms are sacred and secret

_previous note:_ [[how to think humanity as geologic and vice versa]]

Peckover's story seems to be about a werewolf. It is haunting and beautiful and made me think about how we take care and the dangers of not taking care. The narrator (the werewolf) is describing something her mother said to her:

> Our forms are sacred – and secret, she had always told me, they are the shape of our foremothers calling us to remember our creation, our origin in the earth.[@peckover-2022-shelter p.51]
