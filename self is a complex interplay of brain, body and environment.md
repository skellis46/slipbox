# self is a complex interplay of brain, body and environment

Schmalzl, Mardi, Crane-Godreau and Payne discuss embodied cognition in relation to what they call movement-based embodied contemplative practices. The writing is an overview of embodied cognition theory. 

> The closely related “grounded theory” of cognition (Barsalou, 2008) posits that cognition (including abstract thought, conceptual knowledge and semantic memory) is grounded in the brain’s modal sensory systems, rather than being merely based on abstract computations. Similarly, the dynamical systems approach to developmental theory (Camras and Witherington, 2005), psychoanalysis (Krueger, 2002) as well as the newly emerging body-oriented methods of psychotherapy (Heller, 2012), all emphasize [p.1] that bodily sensory systems are the first to develop and that they play a fundamental role in the formation of the sense of self (Sheets-Johnstone, 1999). In sum, all these schools of thought converge on the fact that the experience of one’s self in the world as a cognizant being does not solely emerge from neural activity within the brain. Instead, it involves a complex interplay of brain, body and environment, and the seamless integration of interoceptive, proprioceptive (including vestibular), kinesthetic, tactile, and spatial information (Ehrsson, 2007; Haselager et al., 2012; Ionta et al., 2011).[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased pp.1-2]

- just noting the Sheets-Johnstone citation above, and role in production of self. See also notes at bottom of [[situated and embodied cognition#^4c3eae]] regarding container, package, self. 
- [ ] clarify difference between grounded and enacted approaches

> ... systems such as Hatha Yoga, Qigong, Tai Chi, the Alexander Technique, and the Feldenkrais Method [...] all involve an explicit emphasis on attending to interoceptive, proprioceptive and kinesthetic qualities of experience. They also use concepts such as “being in one’s body” to encourage an embodied experience of the self.[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2]

- this seems to be a very particular use of the word embodied. It's akin to how [[the word embodied is a modifier]] in which attention to the body is foregrounded, as if to underline the unusualness of such attention. This is not to say the the lack of such attention makes for a disembodied sense of the self -- or perhaps it does? That the awareness of 'body' (conventionally, or under normal circumstances for humans) recedes profoundly into the background. It also seems that Schmalzl is using the word _embodied_ in quite a precise way, directly related to situated/embodied view of mind (based on interplay of brain, body and environment) and that practices like the one's she describes encourage "an embodied experience of the self"[@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.2] My thinking here implies that given we (humans) are all already living embodied lives (given embodied cognition) that these practices simply tune our sensitivity to those aspects of our selves that are embodied. Think of a little slider back and forth (more or less tuned to embodiment) and the 'system' of which the slider is part is _embodied cognition_(?)
- focus on interoception, proprioception and kinesthetic experiences is akin to [[somatics is the field which studies the soma]] -- the body from the inside (Hanna, 1970s). But where to place environmental aspect of embodied cognition in the work of the soma? Also, reminds me (I think) of [[ginot - epistemology of somatics]] and the somewhat arbitrary distinction between inside and outside the body. This is pretty important. Like somatics wants to have it's cake and eat it by focusing on the body from the inside, yet embodied cognition science extends the soma (and mind) beyond the borders of the body.
- thinking here also of Kabat-Zinn describing the bodyscape practices (mentioned in [[phenomenology of merleau-ponty and embodiment in the world#^55f871]])
- MECP: "movement-based embodied contemplative practice" [@schmalzl-2014-movementbased p.1]. Seems to me that authentic movement could easily be classed as such. e.g.:
	+ [[sati, mindfulness and remembering]] - body-fulness (very useful)
	+ [[listening and curiosity]] 
	+ [[contemplation beyond rationalization]]
	+ [[the really real]]
	+ [[unconditional positive regard]]
	+ there are other zettel that discuss authentic movement
