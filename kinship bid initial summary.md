# kinship bid initial summary

_previous note:_ 

_Notes based on conversation with Tom Goodwin and Katye Coe on Friday 7 November 2025_

Everyday, unspecialised embodied practice in outdoor settings as a route to collective belonging and nature connectedness – explored longitudinally with diverse groups.

- what is collective belonging and how might we know it when it happens? 
- continue to explore what it is that we don’t understand about this work

##  Possible themes from conversation

### Everyday, not elite
- unspecialise the ‘natural world’ so it is part of day-to-day life, not a niche activity reserved for the few. [University of Derby’s work](https://www.derby.ac.uk/research/themes/zero-carbon/zero-carbon-nbs-research-centre/nature-connectedness-research-group/) positions nature connectedness as a measurable, cultivable relationship with nature via simple pathways such as noticing, beauty, emotion, meaning, care. 
- T and K deeply uncertain about UoD research (we didn’t really explore why)

### Embodiment × nature is the sweet spot 
- our expertise sits at intersection of embodiment, movement and nature connection (not solely nature connection)

### Belonging and integration
- respond to the UK ‘[island of strangers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/uk-risks-becoming-island-of-strangers-without-more-immigration-curbs-starmer-says)’ mood by testing whether long-form group practices in local outdoor places foster neighbourliness and place-based attachment for long-term residents and new arrivals. 

### Ancestral know-how, contemporary life
- engage with ‘old ways’ and cultural heritage without appropriating indigeneity, focusing on locally rooted practices and intergenerational skills sharing.
- what does indigeneity means in the UK?

### Collective sense 

- possible inquiry into how collective sense emerges in-place through repeated, simple outdoor practices – and how bodies act as instruments for perceiving that shared field. Anchor this in participatory sense-making and how meaning is co-created in interaction, communitas and collective effervescence
- place mood research (sensory ethnography and affective atmospheres): 
- Bodies as sensors of the shared
- Community-held knowledge – recognise that much of this understanding lives outside the academy (see note above re indigeneity)

### Long horizon, low tempo 
- depth requires time, repetition and witnessing. Several cohorts over a year (or longer) enables trust and cumulative effects.

### From contact to connection
- shift from mere time outdoors to designed activities that build relationship – aligning with evidence on pathways and [green social prescribing](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-green-social-prescribing-delivery-capacity-assessment/national-green-social-prescribing-delivery-capacity-assessment-final-report). 


## Working questions

- How do different groups travel different arcs – light-touch vs supported cohorts, recent arrivals vs long-term residents
- What is the role of witnessing and “holding space” as a method – can trained witnesses amplify or stabilise change over time
- Where are the limits – when does ‘not knowing’ as stance support growth, and when does it obstruct learning or inclusion

## Possible partners
- Academic: 
	+ Nature Connectedness Research Group, Derby, for construct guidance and pathway-aligned measures (!!) 
	+ Andrew Sanger (The Place)
	+ Adrian Harris
- Practice – Kinship Workshops (TG, KC) as convenors and hosts of witnessing method; selective learning dialogue with Jon Young’s network without adopting [proprietary frameworks](https://courses.8shields.com/mentoring-community-resilience). 
- Health and VCSE – local [social prescribing link](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/social-prescribing/green-social-prescribing/) workers for recruitment and sustainability. 


# 20251107 - kinship conversation (KC, TG, SE) - SE’s notes

- started with overview of academic research bidding (timelines, scope, emphasis on impact)
- participatory / participants -- vis a vis impact 
- "free practice workshops" -- meeting monthly online. 
- Jon Young -- podcaster "nature connection mentor". the wild minds podcast
- what a deeply nature connected contemporary world be like? 
- ancestral skills, ancient crafts, 'old ways', 100s or 1000s years 
- what a modern nature initiation look like and what would the affects be?  (for a contemporary population)
- why is nature not a part of everyday/day to day considerations? 
- places: energy usage (travel industry), tourism, wellbeing and health, social prescribing, meeting places for people (used to happen in nature) ... 
- new arrivals here NEVER get introduced to the land -- welcoming, immigrants, different populations; ideology of integration ... "nation of strangers" -- Keir Starmer (not knowing our neighbours); -- https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3rxrg2pnjo (he used the term "island of strangers")
- we are talking about the everyday -- it's not specialising something in which it is only available to a particular group or population
- possible co-i: Adrian Harris, guy from The Place
- 'natural world' -- to unspecialise it
- sharing information that has been lost (indigenous understandings all the way back to Roman context)
- that is an angle which is more towards cultural heritage ... and the angle of indigeneity ("a longing in me" - Tom "a north star")
- 2027 -- developing a year long programme
- working towards new relationships (as other potential facilitators)
- remembering what is not understood versus what you want to happen (agenda, advocacy, etc)
- balance between embodiment and nature-connectedness -- that this is the sweetspot in terms of our expertise and what is less well understood
- timeline -- if submitted in march 2026 then wouldn't start until march 2027
- Derby University -- nature-connectedness. coming from deep ecology movement (corporate element)
- discussing re collective consciousness -- that a movement of consciousness that doesn't belong to just one -- this is a different approach ... more an embodied relationship. 
- that what is less known is what we collect together that is held in the community (not in the academic world)
- wider collective consciousness that is perhaps less known -- and is the body a 'route' into this understanding. 
- KC working with a Roma woman who took KC for a walk at dawn ... "something in her old ways has taught her that this relationship with a time and environment moves her on" -- talking about sustaining life here. Something was calling her out into this environment -- much much harder to quantify/understand. 
- TG: to make kinship workshop redundant 
- desire to work with groups over a long period of time 
- different groups: some with slight contact others with long group; supported communities over a long period of time. how does integration to land work? what is the end goal? 
- need to be re-entangled / dealing with understanding what we depend on 
- less towards Derby and more towards Jon Young
- https://natureculturenetwork.org/ and also 512 project (Jon Young?) -- https://www.livingconnection1st.net/pages/512-project
- it takes time ... people have an increasingly deep experience with returning and returning 
- the process of doing deeper into a trust with interconnectedness also involves potentially stepping away from 'finding out'. 
- collective consciousness of interconnectedness ... letting go of a framework which I thought I understood 
- distinction between not knowing and unknown ... where not knowing is an approach of way of being (epistemic humility)
- "hold space for individual to intuit their way in" -- exercises that are 'just provocations'. witnessing and holding
- the importance of witnessing and seeing and being with that transformational process === some kind of method here.
