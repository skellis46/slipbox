# to want to run away is an essence of being human

> To want to run away is an essence of being human; it transforms any staying through the transfigurations of choice. To think about fleeing from circumstances, from a marriage, a relationship or from a work is part of the conversation itself and helps us understand the true distilled nature of our own reluctance, thus allowing us a deeper honesty about the cross-currents of our difficulty in being fully present.[@whyte-2019-consolations p.142]
 > Strangely, we are perhaps most fully incarnated as humans when part of us does not want to be here, or doesnâ€™t know how to be here. Presence may be only fully understood and realised through fully understanding our reluctance to show up. To understand the part of us that wants nothing to do with the full necessities of work, of relationships, of doing what is required, is to learn humility, to cultivate self-compassion, and to sharpen that sense of humour essential to a merciful perspective of both a self and another.[@whyte-2019-consolations pp.142-143]
