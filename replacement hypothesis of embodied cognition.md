# replacement hypothesis of embodied cognition

The hypothesis is based on the work of Shapiro, L. (2011). _Embodied Cognition_. New York: Routledge Press.

Below are some extracts from Wilson and Golonka's summary article.[@wilson-2013-embodied]

> A radical conclusion emerges from taking all this seriously: if perception-action couplings and resources distributed over brain, body, and environment are substantial participants in cognition, then the need for the specific objects and processes of standard cognitive psychology (concepts, internally represented competence, and knowledge) goes away, to be replaced by very different objects and processes (most commonly perception-action couplings forming non-linear dynamical systems, e.g., van Gelder, 1995). This, in a nutshell, is the version of embodiment that Shapiro (2011) refers to as the _replacement hypothesis_ and our argument here is that _this hypothesis is inevitable once you allow the body and environment into the cognitive mix_. If such replacement is viable, then any research that keeps the standard assumptions of cognitive psychology and simply allows a state of the body to tweak cognition misses the point. To earn the name, embodied cognition research must, we argue, look very different from this standard approach.[@wilson-2013-embodied p.2]

> Replacement style embodied cognition removes these assumptions and instead looks at all the resources in the environment that might support complex behavior and, critically, the information that might serve to tie them together. One of the most important discoveries of the last 40 years has been that there is, in fact, rich and varied information in the environment (Gibson, 1966, 1979)3 that we are able to use to produce all manner of complex behaviors. The availability of this high quality perceptual information removes the need to invoke any additional cognitive constructs to explain interesting behaviors.[@wilson-2013-embodied p.11]
