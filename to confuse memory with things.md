# to confuse memory with things

_previous note:_ [[perfect memory]]

> as the historian Mary Carruthers (1998: 40) notes, ‘to confuse the activity of remembering with the “things” humans may use to locate and cue their memories'. [@ingold-2013-making]

Ted Chiang does this -- see [[people are made of stories]] -- in the way that video becomes the proxy for remembering/memory.
