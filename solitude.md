# solitude 

>And Storr’s assertion was backed up in 1994 when the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the originator of the concept of “flow” in work) found that teenagers who can’t stand being alone tend to have lessened creative abilities.24 Only in solitude could those youths develop the creative habits—journalling, doodling, daydreaming—that lead to original work.

>We might know this intuitively, but researchers—notably Reed W. Larson—have confirmed our assumptions: when study populations were randomly contacted over the course of many days and asked to report on their status, researchers found that, yes, we seek out solitude when we need free rein in both our thoughts and actions.

Solitude is freedom. Slogans or science?

>The naked self, then, is a bogeyman. Yet facing up to it can eventually become a numinous encounter. This is the achievement that Jung described as “individuation”—the ability to appreciate yourself as a creature separate from your species. As Jung has it: “a being distinct from the general, collective psychology”31 will experience “an enriching of conscious psychological life;”32 being a true individual is a “coming to selfhood or ‘self-realization.’”33 In other words, solitude relieves us from a nervous hive mentality; it reminds us the self is no monster after all.

>The ability to be alone, then, is anything but a rejection of close bonds. It’s an affirmation of those bonds on the most essential level.* To be happily alone is to affirm one’s faith in the love of others. 

>These, then, are solitude’s uses: new ideas; an understanding of the self; and closeness to others. 

>I’ve come to UBC to ask if daydreaming matters, and why. The campus is home to the impressively titled Cognitive Neuroscience of Thought Laboratory, and one of their specialties is “undirected thought processes”—which is shop talk for daydreaming and mind wandering.

Undirected thought processes 

>We now know that when the brain drops its focus on the outside world but remains awake and alert (in other words, when it begins to daydream), it activates something called the default mode network, or DMN. The default mode is anything but a comatose experience. A review of research on the DMN led by Mary Helen Immordino-Yang at the University of Southern California found that a particular style of neural processing is suppressed when we pay direct attention to things, and it emerges when the brain switches to default mode. This daydreaming DMN activity processes personal memories and leads to identity formation.

>As we continue to chat about all this, Christoff moves toward surprisingly philosophical places: “If our mode of life leaves us feeling empty sometimes,” she tells me, “it may be because we aren’t left to our own devices, we aren’t allowed to mull things over. We’re deprived of that sense of meaning and happiness that mind wandering can produce.” 

Own devices!

>We believed those who told us that the devil loves idle hands. And so we gave our hands over for safekeeping. 

>One reason is ludic loops. These are short cycles of repeated actions that cater to our id, and to a brute, reptilian desire for play (as opposed to more developed, narrative-driven ideas of play that have coherent beginnings and endings). Behavioural psychologists have found that we fall into these miniature, repeating loops of pleasure and are driven to access that pleasure again, again, again, without wondering when it will end. Even the faintest of dopamine hits will work. The discovery of repeating patterns works well—humans are hard-wired to enjoy finding patterns. 

>Those are examples from her research, by the way, not hyperbole. For a person who has fallen into the machine zone,

a tunnel vision occurs where you actually lose a sense of the body. Physical pain can even disappear. You feel connected to the machine, almost as though you’re merging with it. And I don’t mean just your hands at the controls, but a merging of your intentions with the intentions of the program. There’s not really a you anymore. The self has fallen away.55

>This stems back to the late sixteenth century, when Western civilization grew increasingly fond of exactitude: dates, distances, rates—it was the measuring of life that girded our new rationalism. 

>Style, after all, is not just a way of expressing oneself; it’s also a way of knowing oneself

>“They will sit in front of a television and say ‘Isn’t it awful’ and still they don’t take their eyes from it.”77 (Later in the interview he notes that such people are only lonely because they don’t know how to be alone.)

We are lonely because we ... 

>The title of James Surowiecki’s book The Wisdom of Crowds often gets turned into a sound bite, suggesting that the masses know best. But those who have read more than the back cover know that Surowiecki is subtler than that. He describes how “groups that are too much alike find it harder to keep learning, because each member is bringing less and less new information to the table. Homogeneous groups … become progressively less able to investigate alternatives.”


Midway through Lewis Carroll’s absurdist novel Sylvie and Bruno, the book’s narrator meets an odd fellow called Mein Herr, who hails from another planet but has a keen interest in ours. The pair ends up discussing the human art of map-making:

“That’s another thing we’ve learned from your Nation,” said Mein Herr, “map-making. But we’ve carried it much further than you. What do you consider the largest map that would be really useful?”
“About six inches to the mile.”
“Only six inches!” exclaimed Mein Herr. “We very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!”
“Have you used it much?” I enquired.
“It has never been spread out, yet,” said Mein Herr: “the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole country, and shut out the sunlight!”88

>This wizardry represents what naturalist Robert Michael Pyle calls “the extinction of experience.”

>James Gleick takes all this to its most essential, umbilical level when he notes, “We were born connected. Solitude came with maturity.”95

>The Germans have a term for the record that so doggedly follows us through our screen age lives: digitale Schleimspur—digital slime. 

>Real growth, real coming of age, demands such unbending, a loosening of borders—both the borders of our home and the borders of our identity—if only so that we may better understand where we come from. In plainer words: not ’til we are lost can we hope to be found.

borders 

>By 7500 BCE, our disenfranchisement from nature was expressed more dramatically when the citizens of Jericho constructed an enormous wall around their city—the first of its kind. The purpose of this wall was probably twofold: it protected against floods as well as marauding enemies. What’s extraordinary about this first significantly walled city is the almost fanatical determination to withdraw from that earlier, wild world.

>Proust once defined reading as “that fruitful miracle of a communication in the midst of solitude.”132 

>The constant reader, says Oatley, learns to hold opinions and ideas that are not their own. We become primed not just to discover new thoughts but to live them, absorb them, care about them.

>The solitary reader rehearses the lives of others. And I think that must be the definition of empathy—to rehearse the lives of others.

>We easily forget how artificial, how steroidal, that boost really is. The ordered, sequential look of a book includes dozens of precise conventions, a set of invisible buttresses that our literary world relies on. Ancient texts called scriptura continua, for example, had no spaces between the words—it was expected that the written page would be used only as a reminder, a cheat sheet, for the real moment when the sounds of words were spoken aloud. Other little tools for making sense of the written page, like capital letters, punctuation marks, and the indenting of new paragraphs, are further inventions that began to show up as the written word broke away from the oral tradition and staked out its own, more solitary domain.

>Rebecca Solnit, in her essay “We’re Breaking Up,” describes how this rush of brief messaging satisfies neither our need for connection nor our desire for disconnection:

I think of that lost world, the way we lived before these new networking technologies, as having two poles: solitude and communion. The new chatter puts us somewhere in between, assuaging fears of being alone without risking real connection. It is a shallow between two deeper zones, a safe spot between the dangers of contact with ourselves, with others.160
