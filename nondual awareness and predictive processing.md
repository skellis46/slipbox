# nondual awareness and predictive processing

_previous note:_ [[nonduality]]

> So, I think that probably the biggest insight then comes when things are very calm and phenomena are deconstructed and de-reified. We're in this quiet space of relatively raw sensations and phenomena. And at that stage, there can be this recognition of the space of the generative model itself, we can recognize the empty space of phenomenal experience. And by space, I mean sort of a conceptual space of perception. And that is this kind of pure awareness that can be recognized. So I think that the really exciting thing about predictive processing is it for the first time gives us a language to understand this pure awareness, this pure non-dual awareness. And it's essentially identified as the entire space of the generative model itself. Now, initially, of course, it can be recognized as the background space inbetween phenomena, inbetween the contents of awareness. But later on, of course, we can recognize that it's not just the background, it's also the foreground, it's also the contents of awareness, is also in that generative model space, the substrate of the generative model. And so that's the sort of a picture for the first time of what we might mean by non-dual awareness.

- I am very curious about the idea of recognising a generative model, let alone the reality

- [[nondual awareness and minimal phenomenal experience]]
- [[flow and nonduality]]
