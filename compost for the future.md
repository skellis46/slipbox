# compost for the future

_previous note:_ [[within a five mile radius of home]]

> Her words caught my eye: a lament for a robin, its wing like a sundial on the road for Dark Mountain’s ‘requiem’ issue. She startled me: speaking about becoming compost for the future at the Borrowed Time summit on death, dying and change. And yet her stories are all vibrantly entangled with life: the nectar-seeking of hummingbirds, the anarchy of the vegative god Dionysus, the fortitude of the hermit crab who waits on the strand for others to appear, so they might simultaneously exchange shells they have outgrown: that moment of vulnerability, of exposure, we need to inhabit a different form. How life happens in between states, a collective dance we don’t always see yet is everywhere all about and inside us.[@ducann-2022-my n.pag]

- Charlotte Du Cann is speaking here of the artist Sophie Strand
- [[footfall]] - obvious link to compost and decomposition. 


> If we look at the history of storytelling, it was not about individual authorship. Homer is actually a practice, people stepped into the role of Homer; in the same way as when composing Orphic hymns, people became Orpheus. You embodied Orpheus.  This is important because of my condition. I have stories I want to tell, things I care about, but I also know that my individual life may not be long enough or hardy enough to complete this work. So what if I reframed authorship and took it out of modernity and said: what if I am making good soil, what if I am beginning the composting process of these ideas, so my particular life is not the only vehicle of its completion? What if someone else can come plant in this soil and sprout something else? So when I make art these days it is about creating space which other people can enter into, it’s not about me as an individual charismatic author.[Strand, in @ducann-2022-my n.pag.]

And here she describes making things as making good soil -- soil for others. This is close to [[future responsibility and stewardship]] or even thinking through [[Krznaric - The Good Ancestor]] but it feels even stronger or more purposeful and filled with humility -- [[epistemic humility]] useful? Also [[luck and merit]]
