# beauty is useful

_previous note:_ [[beauty is the harvest of presence]]

> We have a problematic cultural aversion to beauty being useful. Poetry is connected to my ideas about beauty. Not an objectified artificial glamour but beauty as being the thing we are attracted to, in the way a bee moves towards a flower and incidentally pollinates it. As you pay attention to what you love and what you are attracted to, it will guide you into your ecological niche, where you are most useful.

> So if we pay attention to the poetry in our lives, it shows us where we belong. Acting like an acupuncture needle in a landscape, we will find the beings, the issues, the stories, we need to provide a mouth for.

- [[footfall]] - very interested in simple questions of being drawn towards or away from something. Seems to touch on [[Damasio - Feeling and Knowing]]
