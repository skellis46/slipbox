# rituals are architectures of time

_previous note:_ [[neoliberalism produces a culture of authenticity]]

From interview between Byung-Chul Han and Gesine Borcherdt:

Borcherdt:

> Another book of yours is called _The Disappearance of Rituals_ [2020]. How do rituals, people and objects help to root us in our lives? Can we not manage by ourselves?

Han: 
> Rituals are architectures of time, structuring and stabilising life, and they are on the wane. The pandemic has accelerated the disappearance of rituals. Work also has ritual aspects. We go to work at set times. Work takes place in a community. In the home office, the ritual of work is completely lost. The day loses its rhythm and structure. This somehow makes us tired and depressed.

- [[footfall]] -- what kinds of rituals might I develop? Or might the practices be ritualized or seeking rituals? Indeed, how do practices and rituals differ?
- compare with Alan Jacobs citing Mary Douglas in [[doxa and habitus]] and the way in which ritual creates undisturbable doxa.
- [[culture, assumptions and beliefs]] and the role of rituals in _defining_ a society
