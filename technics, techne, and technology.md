# technics, techne, and technology

 
 >I make a distinction between the use of the words technics, techne, and technology: technics refers to the general category of all forms of making and practice; techne refers to the Greek conception of it, which Heidegger understands as poiesis or bringing forth; and technology refers to a radical turn which took place during European modernity, and developed in the direction of ever-increasing automation, leading consequently to what Heidegger calls the Gestell.[@hui-2016-question p.4]

>it is almost impossible to deny that technics can be understood as the extension of the body or the exteriorisation of memory. Yet they may not be perceived or reflected upon in the same way in different cultures.[@hui-2016-question p.9]
