# attending to an object that does not change

_previous note:_ [[losing oneself]]

In *The Principles of Psychology*, William James stated this observation particularly forcefully:

> There is no such thing as voluntary attention sustained for more than a few seconds at a time. [...] No one can possibly attend continuously to an object that does not change. 

- in AIDAN LYON, What Is Meditation, and Why Should You Do It?
