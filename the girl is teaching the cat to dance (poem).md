# the girl is teaching the cat to dance (poem)

_previous note:_ [[pressure, stress and strain - the body in time#^315ee8]]

> Spring rain—
> the girl is teaching the cat
> to dance.

-- Kobayashi Issa [in @tarrant-2008-bring Chapter 8 Out of Nowhere, the Mind Comes Forth: Light Playing on Children's Faces n.pag.]

- [[love after love (poem)]]
- [[footfall]]
- I am drawn to the sense of the arbitrary in this haiku: rain, girl, cat, dance. It contains so much space, so much time. Like:

Summer sound—
A man falls to the ground
Earth pays no mind
