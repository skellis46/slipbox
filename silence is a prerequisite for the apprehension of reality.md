_previous note:_ [[meta-awareness in dance improvisation]]

> As “a form of silence…which is the prerequisite of the apprehension of reality,” true leisure requires the kind of emptiness in which you remember the fact of your own aliveness. [@odell-2023-saving loc 1911]


- Note: Thinking about silence improvising and doing [[authentic movement]] and also the power of music.
