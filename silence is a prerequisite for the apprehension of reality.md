# silence is a prerequisite for the apprehension of reality

_previous note:_ [[meta-awareness in dance improvisation]]

> As “a form of silence…which is the prerequisite of the apprehension of reality,” true leisure requires the kind of emptiness in which you remember the fact of your own aliveness. [@odell-2023-saving loc 1911]


- Note: Thinking about silence improvising and doing [[authentic movement]] and also the power of music.
- very different from Anil Seth and consciousness being a kind of "controlled hallucination" or even more so with the work of Don Hoffman in which "the world we appear to be navigating is merely a virtual space-time interface, which has evolved to hide the true nature of reality from us" (quote from blurb from "Making Sense of consciousness",. 15 Dec 2022, Making Sense podcast) -- starts to get close to [[panpsychism]].
