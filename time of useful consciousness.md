# Time of useful consciousness

The _digital storytellers_ over at [cut.com](https://www.cut.com) made a video in which they asked 100 people to scream as loudly as they could.

As you can imagine some people cut loose, other people can barely raise a peep. Screaming is so primal and takes so much physical effort. 

Perhaps you have also heard of [Mieskuoro Huutajat](https://www.huutajat.org/en/home), the screaming men's choir. Here's a low-res version of their adaptation of The Star-Spangled Banner:

All this screaming got me thinking about aircraft safety cards. Have you really familiarised yourself with them as instructed? Have you noticed how calm the people look in them? Here's a LOT Polish Airlines card from 1968.

Totally chilled. 

And here's a more modern one from a Lufthansa A380 with drawn figures.

Still totally chilled. If those oxygen masks _appear_ I'm guessing all hell would be breaking loose: screaming would be the least of it. 

In the last year or so I have been reading a lot about the nature of consciousness. I really liked Annaka Harris's delightful (and brief) overview of recent consciousness research called _Conscious_ (2019), and Jay Garfield's _Losing Ourselves: learning to live without a self_ (2022). And here's the remarkable film _Still Life_ by Conner Griffith that is described as somehow illuminating a story of consciousness. I'm not so sure about that, but I found it to be deeply inspiring.

I don't remember what got me started down the consciousness rabbit-hole. Perhaps it's because I've long been interested in the nature of consciousness during peak performance -- you know Csíkszentmihályi's flow -- and just how fragile that state was when thoughts appear. As young tennis players we called the flow state "playing out of your mind" (with cruder variations as well) and we knew from experience that one single thought could catastrophically break that flow. The most common thought being "I could win this", and it was the least useful thought possible.

All this is to say that many years ago in Aotearoa New Zealand a pilot introduced me to what is known as [time of useful consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness). I love that turn of phrase -- it seems to contain so much of the richness of human experience. Yet, what it describes is a rather perfunctory (and perhaps terrifying) physiological concept: the time a human is able to perform effectively while in a poorly oxygenated environment. If a plane rapidly loses cabin pressure at 35000 feet (10650m), the time of useful consciousness is just 15 to 30 seconds. Consider that when you are trying to fit your oxygen mask before helping other fits theirs. 

Not chilled at all.
