# possible benefits of somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

## somatic literature

- _postural adaptations_ (post Feldenkrais)[@hutt-2010-corrective p.258] -- see Wildman, F. and Stephens, P. T. (2001), Feldenkrais Movement Institute, Research Base. [feldenkraisinstitute.org/articles/a_research.html](http://www.feldenkraisinstitute.org/articles/a_research.html).
-  _embodied self-care_ [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- _collaborative creative inquiry_ [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- _embodied criticality_ [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- "improved mobility" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- improved "creative inquiry skills" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- improved "complex thought through inter-subjective de-conditioning processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- Feldenkrais Method "offers a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes"[@kampe-2015-eros p.200]
- "enhanced sense of agency and social complicity by providing conditions for a fleshing out of the 'erotic as power'"[@kampe-2015-eros p.201]
- improved "functioning of the mind-body" (Feldenkrais wanted this)[@mattes-2016-attentional p.260]
- (re Feldenkrais): "enhance people’s awareness of their habitual solutions to motor problems and the sensations accompanying those habits, demonstrate other solutions, and help students select easier, more efficient, and more effective movement options."[Buchanan and Ulrich (2001), in @mattes-2016-attentional p.261]

- what do any of these mean? Perhaps _postural adaptations_ is clear, also "improved mobility" (neither of which are particularly focused or precise).
