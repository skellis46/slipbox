# possible benefits of somatic practices

_previous note:_ [[basic questions about somatic practices]]

## somatic literature

- _postural adaptations_ (post Feldenkrais)[@hutt-2010-corrective p.258] -- see Wildman, F. and Stephens, P. T. (2001), Feldenkrais Movement Institute, Research Base. [feldenkraisinstitute.org/articles/a_research.html](http://www.feldenkraisinstitute.org/articles/a_research.html).
-  _embodied self-care_ [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- _collaborative creative inquiry_ [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- _embodied criticality_ [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- "improved mobility" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- improved "creative inquiry skills" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- improved "complex thought through inter-subjective de-conditioning processes" [@kampe-2015-eros p.200] (Feldenkrais)
- Feldenkrais Method "offers a pedagogical foundation for the vitalising and integration of the learners’ sexually potent self into training and performance processes"[@kampe-2015-eros p.200]
- "enhanced sense of agency and social complicity by providing conditions for a fleshing out of the 'erotic as power'"[@kampe-2015-eros p.201]
- improved "functioning of the mind-body" (Feldenkrais wanted this)[@mattes-2016-attentional p.260]
- (re Feldenkrais): "enhance people’s awareness of their habitual solutions to motor problems and the sensations accompanying those habits, demonstrate other solutions, and help students select easier, more efficient, and more effective movement options."[Buchanan and Ulrich (2001), in @mattes-2016-attentional p.261]
- learn newly [Eddy, 2009, p. 6 in @mullan-2014-somatics p.256]
- become pain free [Eddy, 2009, p. 6 in @mullan-2014-somatics p.256]
- move more easily [Eddy, 2009, p. 6 in @mullan-2014-somatics p.256]
- do our life work more efficiently [Eddy, 2009, p. 6 in @mullan-2014-somatics p.256]
- perform with greater vitality and expressiveness [Eddy, 2009, p. 6 in @mullan-2014-somatics p.256]
- better coordination [Batson & Schwartz, 2007, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.257]
- efficiency of movement [Batson & Schwartz, 2007, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.257]
- recovery from injury [Batson & Schwartz, 2007, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.257]
- greater physical expression [Batson & Schwartz, 2007, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.257]
- developing spatial awareness [Batson & Schwartz, 2007, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.257]
- refining sensory (proprioceptive) experience [Batson & Schwartz, 2007, in @mullan-2014-somatics p.257]
- physical harmony [@mullan-2014-somatics p.259]
- profound and multiple learning difficulties (PMLD)?? -- Lamond, [https://doi.org/10.1386/jdsp.1.2.225_1](https://doi.org/10.1386/jdsp.1.2.225_1)
- "help women with breast cancer deal with the symptoms of their treatments" - [https://doi.org/10.1386/jdsp.4.2.211_1](https://doi.org/10.1386/jdsp.4.2.211_1)
- "challenge the dominant discourses" re sexual abuse: [https://doi.org/10.1386/jdsp.7.1.21_1](https://doi.org/10.1386/jdsp.7.1.21_1)
- dance to foster critical thinking (not somatics): [10.1080/15290824.2014.907497](10.1080/15290824.2014.907497)
- See Eddy 2009 on p.8 (wow!)
- Ginot mentions how the three conditions of somatics -- "moving very slowly and very little, and developing an increasingly fine attention to increasingly subtle movements."[@ginot-2010-shusterman pp.20-21] -- become proxies for somatic practice including when having sex (and implied/suggested by Shusterman)
- Somatics "contributes to the reorganization of the multiplicity and heterogeneity of that which we call the body" [@ginot-2010-shusterman p.25]
- "The first value that we usually attribute to these practices is prophylactic: they serve to prevent professional accidents or provide functional rehabilitation following injuries. Although increasingly integrated into dancer training and dance pedagogy, somatics first found its way into dance as a means to limit accidents."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.12]
- "improvement of virtuosity in dance."[@ginot-2010-shusterman p.12] - citing Fortin etc
- antidote to dominant dance practices (Ginot, p.12)
- Ginot describes it as a "conceptual apparatus" that "enhances our understanding of pedagogy, dancer's health, and corporeal and gestural aesthetic"(p.13)
- "the potential to question and critique the dominant social discourse and practices of neo-liberal societies, in which the life of people is increasingly subject to control, surveillance and regulation"[@fortin-2017-looking p.146] -- Fortin mentions 4 others in same paragraph
- "that through somatics we can exercise individual and collective agency within the constraints of neo-liberal societies, which tend to underestimate social inequalities. Actually, social somatics is expanding into what some call ‘politicized somatics’."[@fortin-2017-looking p.148]


- note the basic list of benefits/changes in [[practice of somatic movement education and therapy]]

## JDSP V1.1

### Editorial [@whatley-2009-editorial]

- somatics as challenge to traditional dance: "theories and practices that constantly question traditional modes of doing, ways of seeing and experiencing dance"[@whatley-2009-editorial p.3] (Ginot mentions this idea as well)

### Eddy [@eddy-2009-briefa]

- what do any of these mean? Perhaps _postural adaptations_ is clear, also "improved mobility" (neither of which are particularly focused or precise).
- noting from Hillier and Worley that they make a distinction between generic learning and self-improvement and a healing or disease-specific mechanism of action.[@hillier-2015-effectiveness p.10]
- therapeutic and educational benefits[@mullan-2014-somatics p.254]
- psychotherapeutic benefits (Johnson and Hanna - see Mullans, p.255


## science literature

- improved balance: "[t]here is further promising evidence that the Feldenkrais Method may be effective for a varied population interested in improving functions such as balance."[@hillier-2015-effectiveness p.10] -- I found this cited in Mattes [-@mattes-2016-attentional p.266]
- improved balance from Alexander technique [@mattes-2016-attentional p.263]
- improved gait behaviour (Alexander) [@mattes-2016-attentional p.263]
- decreased back pain (Alexander) [@mattes-2016-attentional p.263]. None of these three (re Alexander were statistically significant, although promising with back pain)
- see also in [[Ahmadi - Comparison of the effects of the Feldenkrais method]] -- big +1 for FM
- see large review of science of body awareness in [[Mehling - If It All Comes Down to Bodily Awareness]].
- what is the mechanism for changes? (assuming changes are real?)
- working with trauma in [@payne-2015-somatic]. Payne gives a very useful summary of efficacious aspects of [[interoception]]
