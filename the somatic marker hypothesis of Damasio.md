# the somatic marker hypothesis of Damasio

_previous note:_ [[Craig - How do you feel -- now?]]

> This is in accordance with the “somatic marker” hypothesis of Damasio (1994, 1999) stating that this meta-representation of bodily states constitutes an emotional feeling, accessible to consciousness and providing the “gut-feeling” that guides our decision processes and forms the basis for our “self” and consciousness. The neuroanatomic basis of interoception represents the link for the “body in the mind” and the mechanisms of the embodiment of affective and cognitive functions. [@herbert-2012-body n.pag.]

- [[Herbert - The Body in the Mind]]

Messy writing but the previous sentence (the last of the preceding paragraph) which I think the "This is in accordance with" refers to is:

> In this view, the neural basis for ‘‘awareness’’ is the neural representation of the physiological condition of the body, and the homeostatic neural construct for a feeling from the body is the foundation for the encoding of all feelings (Craig, 2009b).
