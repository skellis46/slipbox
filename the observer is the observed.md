# the observer is the observed

_previous note:_ [[interpretation remains present]]

---

In _Emptiness: a practical guide for meditators_, Guy Armstrong writes that the observer "is only a concept, an assumption not borne out in reality. There is no 'I' standing apart from our experiences."[@armstrong_emptiness_2017 Chapter 2, n.p.] He then cites the Indian philosopher Krishnamurti[^1] who said, "The observer is the observed."[in @armstrong_emptiness_2017 Chapter 2, n.p.]

Armstrong attemps to clarify Krishnamurti's aphorism by suggesting that we cannot stand apart from our experience. He says that "When we are observing anger, we are, at least in part, that anger."[@armstrong_emptiness_2017 Chapter 2, n.p.].

_thoughts & links:_

- am thinking of centrist or balanced perspectives that call on observable evidence while acknowledging the ways in which we are implicated in what and how we observe
- #finger-pointing-moon -- thinking of authentic movement and the limits of an [[empirical research]] approach. I'm sitting between lines of western and eastern philosophy, and also between mysticism and science. I wonder if it's worth #toread The Tao of Physics again (once more with feeling)?
- [[direct experience through the senses]]
- [[mesearch]]
- [[standpoint epistemology]]
