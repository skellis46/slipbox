# the difference between whining and complaining

_previous note:_ 

> Complaining isn’t whining, though. Whining is communication that exasperates others, because it is complaint without benefit or action. The best traveling companions are often those that don’t whine, even when they have a very good reason to. Whining is empty commentary where no action is possible, about something we already understand.
