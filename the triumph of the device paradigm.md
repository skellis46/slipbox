# the triumph of the device paradigm

_previous note:_ [[device paradigm and focal things]]

> But this is only part of the picture. Borgmann opposed *devices* to what he called *focal things*. Focal things demand something of us. They require a measure of care, practice, and engagement that devices do not. Our use of them induces our focus, which they invite by design. “The experience of a [focal] thing,” Borgmann also notes, “is always and also a bodily and social engagement with the thing’s world.” There are, in other words, embodied and communal dimensions to the use of a focal thing. They involve our bodies, and they involve us in relationships to a degree that devices do not.

> So, then, one more thing I can say for Apple’s ad is this: when explaining Borgmann’s work, I can now simply say “watch this.” The ad amounts to a compelling, visceral depiction of a device crushing an array of focal things and thus eliminating the corresponding focal practices and their attendant skills and pleasures. It is a visual depiction of the triumph of the device paradigm.

> The near universal response to the ad, which was heartening, also demonstrated another of Borgmann’s core claims: our experience tends to be enriched by focal things and diminished by devices. A good life is supported by a diverse array of focal things and practices, which tend to reward us with deeper, more meaningful experiences; a gratifying measure of bodily skill and competence; and possibly even a stronger fabric of relationships. Alternatively, a life characterized merely by the consumption of virtual goods mediated through devices, and the subsequent dependence and isolation such a life necessarily entails, will not be conducive to our well-being.

> Granted, it is hard to resist the promise of ease, safety, efficiency, and convenience, particularly when many of us may already be operating with some degree of burnout and exhausted by what is demanded of us to simply get by day to day. This is the trap set for us by our existing social order. When society is built to run like a machine for the optimization of profit and productivity with little regard for the constraints inherent in the embodied human condition, then we are tempted to embrace the device paradigm as a matter of survival or because we have been conditioned by the machine and have internalized its values.

> The point, to be clear, is not that you and I must cook every meal from scratch or listen only to music we make for ourselves or never use a device that may facilitate the completion of certain tasks. The point is that we ought to resist any vision of the good life in which we are reduced to mere consumers of readily accessible digitally simulated goods or in which human flourishing is indexed solely to the sheer quantity of our techno-economic system’s outputs without reference to their kind and quality. Implicit in Apple’s ad is the idea that virtually unlimited access to such goods is the *summum bonum* of human existence.
