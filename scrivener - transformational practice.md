>art that changes art should be understood as making a contribution to understanding, since it requires an adjustment to cognitive schemata and semantic networks relevant to the appreciation of art.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.271]

Stephen Scrivener's chapter in the Biggs and Karlsson edited volume is called  _Transformational Practice: On The Place Of Material Novelty In Artistic Change_. In it Scrivener attempts to tackle the seemingly vexed question of whether art "embodies a research function."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260] His concern is that the question has been colonised (or restricted) by "funding bodies and the like"[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.259] such that the context for the debate has determined or _caused_ the debate itself. In response, Scrivener attempts to redefine the question by comparing the presence of transformational practices in art to Kuhnian paradigm shifts "since such renewals appear to be contingent on the production of new knowledge".[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260]

He draws on Rancière’s theory of art -- and conception of the relationship between words and images -- to claim that "a bond has to be formed between words and images in order for there to be art."[-@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.264] Scrivener further suggests that according to Rancière:

>art’s existence relies on the weaving of relations between practices of making, seeing, saying and thinking. ... [these relations] are constructed, dismantled and reconstructed according to changing ambition, need and interest ...[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.262-263]

At the heart of the chapter is Scrivener's concern for understanding how the "material innovations"[-@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260] of the artist contribute to changing how we understand art. He uses the paintings of John Constable as "a model of the research function in art, since it contributed to a new understanding of art and to its renewal."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.260]

Scrivener proposes that one way an art work can be a mechanism for transforming how we understand art is by "engendering surprise":[-@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.264]

>[Surprise] generates curiosity by informing the conscious self about the occurrence of a schema discrepancy. Since this information concerns one’s belief system it involves a meta-cognitive process: cognition about cognition or knowing about knowing.[-@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.264]

Scrivener relates his thinking about transformation and surprise by introducing the idea of conjunctive and disjunctive art. Disjunctive art involves some kind of separation between -- in the case of Constable -- "poetic expression and realistic observation"[@scrivener_transformational_2011 p.268] that was (at the time) surprising. It's not clear to me what disjunctive art might be in relation to practice-research but the term seems to open up the way in which an art work might transform (through surprise) how we understand art. Conjunctive art reveals -- again using practices at the time of Constable -- a tight connection between science and art, as if perfectly aligned. 

Later in Constable's life it is thought that he "sought to articulate a way of seeing his paintings as conjunctive, rather than disjunctive."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.265] Scrivener describes how Constable through his lectures "provides not an explanation, not a critique, not an assessment of his work, but a conceptual scaffold for its reception and appreciation."[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.270] 

In many respects, Scrivener's chapter is arguing for writing about artistic research such that we explicate how art is changed by the work we have made. In other words, the art work in practice-research is disjunctive, but writings about the work serve a conjunctive function. 


>in short, the cognitive disruption of expectation in the material present has to be re-described in terms of a new visibility; a connection needs to be made between, ‘ways of making, modes of speech, forms of visibility, and protocols of intelligibility’ (Rancière 2007: 3).[p.269]

"which conjoins text and image so as to construct a visibility appropriate to his or her work’s ambition."[p.271]

>understood in this way, new knowledge is a potential for a certain type of action, or as Johnson advises, ‘knowing is a process of intelligent inquiry into and transformation of experience’ (Chapter 8). Conceived in this way, neither certainty of interpretation nor the binding of new understanding to that of the past is a necessary precondition for the collective endorsement of new knowledge. in the case of art, these features of new knowledge, which in many other fields are preconditions for the commitment to further investigation, might merely serve to diminish the productive potential of both modes of innovation, since each is an unstable moment in the unmaking and remaking of aesthetics regimes. novel works of art and criticism are not to be understood as, ‘true propositions or statements about how things are and how they work, which can be verified by past, present or future experience’ (Chapter 8), that have to be acquired before we can arrive at collective comprehension of a change in understanding of art. Rather they are better understood as unstable, active contributions to the coalescence of collective interest and understanding that make it possible to speak of artistic renewals, such as impressionism and Cubism, and of artists who changed art.[p.272]

>modernism, the avant-garde and postmodernism, if not dismantling all tradition, all expectation, have brought us to a point where collective agreement about art is problematic. We may actually be at a moment when art becomes an arena incapable of cognitive surprise, since the frameworks for reception and interpretation have been eroded. in such an arena, the work of art may not be able to stand on its own without the presence of an ‘other’ that gives it visibility, to borrow Rancière’s articulation of the term. This, perhaps, explains why contemporary artists are increasingly choosing to talk and write, as well as show. in fact, the whole debate around art and research may come to be seen as reflecting this historical turn; the moment when the artist found it necessary to articulate the reflective and projective character of his or her practice.[p.272]

>Rancière (2007: 78–9) assigns to the critical writer the highly creative task, not simply of adding retrospective discourse to the ‘nakedness of forms’, but of constructing, through de-figuration, the visibility necessary for seeing a new bond between image and text. in short, he offers a way of thinking about art that denies the autonomy of the art from words – the birth of a regime of art is their bonding and its death is their separation. art that changes art is art that modifies the bond between image and ideas.[p.273]

>here it is argued that Constable’s lectures functioned (if too late to have a major influence on how his art was understood and used) as a response to his critics that was designed to guide his listeners toward the mode of visibility appropriate to his art. as such, it is argued, Constable’s lectures, when seen in conjunction with his art, function as a counterpart to de-figuration and as a model of art’s research function.[p.274]

>... knowledge is better understood as a potential for a certain type of action contributing to an emergent coalescence of collective interest and understanding. Nevertheless, the function of surprise and wonder within this historical system of exchange relies on existing and collectively shared cognitive schemata and semantic networks, namely shared expectations, and Modernism, the Avant-garde and Postmodernism have all contributed to a general dismantling or fragmentation of such certainties. In the contemporary context, the grounds against which novelty can stand out are not pre-given. Whilst for Constable, speaking to his art was forced upon him as a last resort to provide his contemporaries with ‘the right eyes’ to see his work, we may now be at a moment when it has to be the artist’s first resort to establish the ground against which surprise can be registered and its consequences activated, including the coalescing of interests that sustain a cultural bond between image and idea.[p.274]

>Today, it is suggested, the artist may need to take personal responsibility for contributing to the renegotiation or reconstruction of the bond between image and text. in Rancière’s terms, the research function in art will now require the artist to contribute to the construction of the mode of visibility appropriate to the interpretation of the material innovation of his or her works of art.[p.275]

_thoughts & links:_

- tight relationship to [[literature notes/Noë - Strange Tools, Art and Human Nature]] and [[art is bad design on purpose]]; e.g. on p.261 Scrivener mentions the art work of Stubbs and Constable, and says that their "primary contribution" was to "art fact and art discourse."
- Scrivener discusses Frayling's conception of [[research on, for and in the arts]] on p.261.
- [[a case for writing in practice-research]] -- see pp 263 and 264 in relation to Rancière
- fascinating how he calls on a historical painter to exemplify research in the arts. Scrivener is in danger of doing precisely what Frayling was worried about: "we feel we don’t want to be in a position where the entire history of art is eligible for a postgraduate research degree"[@frayling_research_1993 p.5]
- I don't really understand his use of Constable -- what are the politics of this choice/decision? 
- regarding conjunctive/disjunctive art, my assumption is that practice-research functions best when it is disjunctive (akin to Constable in Scrivener's thinking). 

>Constable was advocating that if the artist is to see, then the artist must know: to know, the artist should acquire scientific understanding of nature and its effects, and, guided by a scientific method of observation, apply that understanding in poetic interpretation.[@scrivener_transformational_2011 pp.267]
- reminded here of my ambition in #finger-pointing-moon -- embracing empirical analysis in to open up new poetic, imagistic and discursive possibilities
