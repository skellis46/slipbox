# dances enframed by software

_previous note:_ [[embodied structures and patterns of film]]

Low friction technology (convenience, see [[how informs what and this produces culture#^aa0fb6]]) and our behavior, ways of thinking and epistemic understanding change. This is Postman really. This is the printing press. Bench is talking about documentation (is this accurate?). I'm talking about making. Yes, how things are made is changing. That's a given. But what things are made. It goes all the way back to the kinds of dancing. Our focus has been on how technologies influence production, post-production, and presentation. Opportunity here to mention key influences of screendance writing about editing, production (many from IJSD?, Pearlman) But the mode of presentation (this is where we dance now) is inevitably reaching backwards through the film-making 'workflow' into the dancing itself. These are dances enframed by software (more than hardware) and algorithms. But they are also dances of togetherness, pleasure. The hearth? 

Start with Heidegger. inevitable it has been written about so much in dance, and the ways in which technologies have influenced corporeal practices. In the second (?) volume of IJSD, Cooper Albright asked four (?) artists to respond to Heidegger: [[Cooper Albright – The Tensions of Techne]] 

>It’s not about how digital technology changes us, but how we change ourselves and one another now that we live so digitally.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 2, n.pag.]

My assumed knowledge of what this "play" is for changes how I see what I see. See [[Rushkoff – Present Shock#^9ab84a]]:

> When we focus on the space around the pieces, we have shifted to the time sensibility of kairos. The space between things matters more than the things themselves. We are thinking less about tinkering with particular objects than about recognizing or influencing the patterns they create and the connections they make.[@rushkoff-2013-present Chapter 4: Fractalnoia—To Be Or Not To Be, n.pag]
