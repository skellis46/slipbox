# consciousness and the self

_previous note:_ [[what the self feels like]]

Conversation between Sam Harris and Anil Seth called _consciousness and the self_

[samharris.org/episode/SE18D5B93AF](https://samharris.org/episode/SE18D5B93AF)

> Internal perception is less object oriented. - Anil Seth 

> We overestimate our ability to "capture" our phenomenal statesÂ 

- talking about what happens with practice (say meditation): different experiences occur and also able to notice the same experiences differently. Two distinct. 1:26:10 -- [[measuring outcome but not process in somatic practices]] and also [[somatics unlimited edit bin#perception of change / change of perception]] (which now has it's own zettel at [[perception of change versus change in perception]])

- got me thinking about [[authentic movement]] and the very particular circumstances of the practice: 
	+ eyes closed
	+ not goal oriented or instrumental (except perhaps in case of the therapeutic component -- akin to meditation); see [[focal things and engagement]]
