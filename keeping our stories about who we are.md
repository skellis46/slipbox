# keeping our stories about who we are

_previous note:_ [[we are almost always close]]

> Everyone thinks that they want happiness, but they might not. They might rather keep their stories about who they are and about what is impossible. Happiness is not an add-on to what you already are; it requires you to become a different person from the one who set off seeking it.[@tarrant-2008-bring Introduction n.pag.]
