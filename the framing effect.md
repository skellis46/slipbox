# the framing effect

The framing effect occurs when people choose different options based on how those options are presented to them. In 1981 Tversky and Kahneman conducted a study that explored the effect. Participants were presented with effectively the same data, but presented as positive or negative outcomes. Seventy-two percent of participants chose the positively worded treatment, but this percentage dropped to 22% when the same treatment was worded in a negative way. 

>the framing effect is [considered](https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/67B/2/139/537897) one of the largest biases in decision making, particularly in important areas such as health care and financial decisions.[@lecunff-2021-framing n.pag]
