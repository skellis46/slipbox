# synchronising with others while dancing raises pain tolerance

_previous note:_ [[network self and social identities]]

Note that this link is tenuous but my _hook_ is about social construction of identity (in this case through moving together).

This is a trade press (conversation.com) summary of research about efficacy of dance and how dancing in synchrony with others and exertion during dance independently raise pain threshold and encourage social bonding. 

Written by Bronwyn Tarr (at the time of publication a Post-doc researcher at Oxford in Experimental Psychology).

> So far, our testing of the “social bonding” hypothesis of dance has focused on one particular aspect: synchronisation with other people. It turns out that when you synchronise even a small movement, like the tapping of your finger in time with someone else, you feel closer and more trusting of that person than if you had tapped out of time.

Used pain thresholds as indirect measure of endorphins.

Seems pretty clear that it's not so much that it's dancing, but rather that it's dancing together (ie could be any activity done together in time).
