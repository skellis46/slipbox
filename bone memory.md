# bone memory

_previous note:_ [[accumulation of local soil and local culture]]

- [[perfect memory]]

> If we wander through a flowering meadow in May, we become enmeshed in this tactile exchange. When we look closely, we may recognise that our nervous system mirrors the infinite mycorrhizal networks beneath our feet. We are intertwined across this threshold through sensation, perception, and organic memory, kind of like an umbilical cord, or what the mythologist Martin Shaw calls ‘bone memory’. That’s why we find it enlivening; it rouses our own creaturehood. It reminds us of our place in the natural world and of our intimate belonging to the Earth; we realise we are not so alien after all.

- really like this term _bone memory_ and also the sense of being alien (or not). Both concepts useful for this perfect memory project.
