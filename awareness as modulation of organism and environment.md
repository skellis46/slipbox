# awareness as modulation of organism and environment

_previous note:_ [[awareness-ing]]

> It makes a great deal of biological, psychological, and ecological sense instead to think of awareness as a constant modulation of the open interaction between an organism and its environment, of the adjustment of the state of the organism and attunement of the posture and goals of the organism as its senses and movements interact with the world it inhabits. In other words, we can think of awareness as a mode of embedding of the organism in its world, instead of as the relation between an interior subject and an exterior object, even if that is how it appears to us in introspection. To think of awareness in this way is to take seriously the idea that we don’t stand against the world as subjects that detect its properties or agents that act on it, but instead are part of the world, and that awareness is more an attunement to our environment than a recording in our minds of what is going on outside. This approach to cognition, which is called the “embedded, embodied, enactive” model of cognition, is gaining wide acceptance among philosophers and cognitive scientists.[6](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/32011253#chapter5-6) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gs7bwqh802vtm5c3zmfkd798)) [@garfield-2022-losing]

- see [[Ingold on kiteflying, action and the dance of agency]] and air as medium; he also mentions Barad
- thinking about difference between attention, awareness, sensation and perception ... are there others?
