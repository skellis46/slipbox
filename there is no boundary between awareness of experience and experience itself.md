# there is no boundary between awareness of experience and experience itself

_previous note:_ [[feeling vs looking while moving]]

This is from a [Waking Up daily meditation](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/daily/DADC395) from Monday 18 March 2024, and starting at 1:39min:

> And now become aware of the sensations of breathing, whether you feel it as the rising and falling of your chest, or abdomen or the tip of the nose ... just feel the breath somewhere and pay close attention and rather than observe the breath simply feel it. The sense of observing or witnessing or paying attention to a sensation can reinforce this sense of dualism, where you're up in your head, aiming attention down at a sensation. See if you can simply feel the breath from the inside with no distance. You're feeling it, where it is: tension, movement, however it appears. A similar shift from observing to feeling can occur in walking meditation. But rather than trying to broadcast your attention down towards your feet and legs, you simply feel the sensations where they are. But now notice too that this same shift into feeling can extend to everything. In some sense, whatever is appearing in your visual field is how your visual system feels. So it is with emotions and thoughts and anything else you can notice. See if you can feel your way into the sense that there is no boundary between awareness of experience and experience itself. Awareness isn't just the space in which experience is arising. It is the experience. There's only experience. So there's no boundary between awareness and anything and everything that you can notice or feel. 

Useful also in ongoing _project_ to dissemble [[sensation, attention, awareness, perception, action and feeling]]. Perhaps need to add consciousness and experience to that list? 

- this one also on 'having a body' (useful for Research Centre and ongoing research): [[the body from the inside]], [[the self is another perception]], [[body being known]] -- but Plessner's idea is in [[an object of special regard]]
- and on awareness; see for instance [[awareness as modulation of organism and environment]]. But Harris' meditation here almost does away with the need for a term like "awareness" -- or that it's more or less synonymous with experience. 
- and on [[feeling vs looking while moving]]
- [[losing oneself]]
- [[research centre for body and presence]]
