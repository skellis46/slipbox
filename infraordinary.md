# infraordinary

_previous note:_ [[the body as a garden to be tended]]

Dear

In James Bridle's recent book _Ways of Being_ he describes a paradox first formulated by the British meteorologist Lewis Fry Richardson:

> the more accurately you try to measure some things, the more complex they become.

Richardson had this hunch – as recounted by Bridle – that the likelihood of war between two neighbouring states might have something to do with the length of their shared border. To test this idea, Richardson needed accurate measurements of borders, but these measurements did not exist. Imagine taking just 100 metres of a coastline and measuring it with a 20m ruler. Then, what if you use a 10m ruler, a 1m ruler, a 30cm ruler? What Richardson discovered is that the more closely you measure a coastline, the longer it becomes. This [coastline paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Fry_Richardson#Research_on_the_length_of_coastlines_and_borders) became known as the _Richardson effect_ and is now understood to be a key part of what we now call fractals. 

Much of what I've been doing the last 30 years has been grappling with the nature of artistic practice: what it means to have a practice; what constitutes a practice; how practices change in time and with attention; the fetishisation of artistic practice; the utility and uselessness of practice ... etc. 

When you spend a long time doing something -- in my case improvising through dance -- it ends up feeling as if you are a character in a novel by Georges Perec. All those lists! All that detail that amounts to nothing! All those games to attempt to find something different or novel! 

In his 1973 essay "Approaches to What?" Perec coined the word _infraordinary_. Here's Jenny Odell describing this word in her recent book _Saving Time_: 

> Media and the public perception of time, [Perec] wrote, focused on the extraordinary—things outside the ordinary, like cataclysmic events and upheavals. The infraordinary was, instead, that layer inside or just beneath the ordinary, and being able to see it involved the challenge of seeing through the habitual. This was no small task, given that invisibility is part of the very nature of habit. “This is no longer even conditioning, it’s anaesthesia,” Perec writes. “We sleep through our lives in a dreamless sleep. But where is our life? Where is our body? Where is our space?"

I have a sneaky suspicion that spending time doing one thing (any thing) ends up being an infraordinary act not unlike taking an increasing smaller ruler to measure a coastline.
