# losing oneself - summary of transcripts

_previous note:_ [[improvisation and the threshold of the self]]

These ideas are drawn from a series of practices and conversations between Katye Coe and Simon Ellis from Jan-Mar 2024. The practice was a form of authentic movement.

The conversations repeatedly return to one central problem: how, in (this version of) authentic movement, attention shifts from an apparently personal, agentive mode (moving, choosing, tracking) into episodes where agency, time, effort and even “me” feel less definable or drop out. This shift seems both experientially concrete and linguistically slippery, so the conversations oscillate between careful phenomenological description and scepticism about “making it into a thing”.

It is possible to group the various conversations into a form that could seem to mirror our experience of the practice: 

1. entry (permission, sensation, basic orientation)
2. widening field (attention loosens, imagery may appear, time softens)
3. threshold events (trip hazard/glimpse, loss of self and binary categories)
4. return (safety, gravity, self reappearing, language reasserting)

Some key themes from the conversations:

## 1. “Trip hazards”, “glimpses” and the threshold moment

A recurring motif is that certain moments function as “trip hazards” in Roger Linden’s sense: ordinary, matter-of-fact episodes that nevertheless precipitate a clear seeing, often described as “nothing to do, nowhere to go” or “this is it”. These are also compared with “glimpses” in other nondual vocabularies.

The threshold is often recognised retrospectively: you only know “it fell away” when it starts coming back, marked by an audible “ohh” or a felt reappearance of self, time or effort.

## 2. Sensation as gateway, then widening into a field

The initial phrases of a practice session are repeatedly described as starting with sensation: skin, contact, tone, breath, weight, light behind eyelids, sound as orientation. This “going to sensation” is treated as a reliable entry point, a gateway. 

As the practice develops within a session, attention is described as widening, becoming less “point to point” and less separative. The language shifts from attention moving around objects to a wider “field” or “open space”, where edges of “thing-ness” blur.

## 3. Not wanting, non-grasping, refusal of hierarchy

A strong through-line is the role of “not wanting”: an active refusal to reach for experiences, results or even the wish to be able to report back. This is not framed as suppressing pleasure, but as distinguishing pleasure (present, already happening) from desire (future-oriented, reaching). The same logic appears as “no hierarchy” of what should happen next. Surprise is allowed, not engineered.

## 4. Permission and container: the ethical/relational precondition

KC/SE repeatedly treat the permissive container as foundational: “it has to all be allowed”. This is linked to authentic movement’s therapeutic lineage (witness availability, non-judgement), while also clarifying that your situation is not therapy and depends on being “resourced” as practitioners. This theme includes a negative image: choreographic or institutional contexts where judgement saturates the room make the required conditions impossible.

## 5. Witnessing, recognition and self-consciousness

A dense cluster of talk distinguishes:

- recognition/registering (a felt, visible shift that a witness can sense)
- self-consciousness (awareness of being seen, often experienced as invasive or “infecting”)

KC/SE treat recognition as valuable data but also as a risk: if the witness starts “reaching” to spot the threshold, the witnessing itself becomes shaped by agenda.

There is also an explicit meta-question about whether the conversations themselves influence the subsequent practice, with examples where they do (curiosity carried into witnessing) and strategies for “checking” that influence.

## 6. Inside–outside oscillation and the performance-trained habit

Katye describes a persistent oscillation between first-person and third-person perspectives (“inside” sensation and “outside” appearance), partly conditioned by being witnessed and recorded, partly by long performance training. This oscillation is not treated as a flaw but as one of the built-in mechanics of how the practice is currently being done.

Relatedly, Simon names a habit of wanting to give watchers “access” to internal experience, which complicates the boundary between expression and self-conscious performance.

## 7. Movement vs sitting: what movement uniquely does

KC/SE explicitly compare this practice to “meditation” or “sitting”, with two consistent claims:

- movement generates sensation and so makes certain kinds of attention easier to sustain (less drift into discursive thought)
- witnessing is “a version of sitting”, but modulated by having moved already

Movement is described as agitating or exciting awareness, creating “many things to attend to”, which can be functionally protective against getting lost in thought.

## 8. Time, effort and binary categories falling away

Time is repeatedly cited as an early casualty: it disappears for the mover and sometimes for the witness. Alongside time, effort, separation and other binaries are described as losing grip, which is taken as characteristic of the “unseparated” register.

This is also where paradoxical language becomes salient (elusive/obvious, empty/full), understood as a sign of language straining, not as decoration.

## 9. Imagery, memory and “slideshow” phenomena

Alongside sensation, there is a recurring emergence of imagery: personal memories, childhood scenes, “threads” that surface without being forced. These are treated carefully: not dismissed as irrelevant, but also not clung to or over-interpreted.

This line is explicitly compared to daydreaming or awake-dreaming practices, raising the question of whether sensation is the _gateway_ whereas other traditions may enter through image or story.

## 10. Gravity, tone, surrender and the floor as a material limit

The physical mechanics of gravity recur as both sensory anchor and constraint:

- tone is framed as fundamental because it is how the body negotiates gravity
- “going all the way down” reaches a limit point (“nowhere else to go”) that requires a conscious reinitiation of movement
- surrender, falling and weight-drop are treated as bodily metaphors that may align with, or at least support, the “open awareness” register

This becomes a concrete way the “threshold between moving and being moved” is materially staged: the body cannot disappear into abstraction because safety, joints, light, impact and resistance keep reasserting themselves.

## 11. Practice as midwifing, not manufacturing

A repeated ethical-methodological stance is that KC/SE are not “making something happen” but attending to what is already happening, with “midwifing” offered as a non-mystical description of the role of practice. This aligns with the emphasis on not wanting, not reaching, not specialising.

## 12. Demystification vs calcification: the risk of making a blueprint

SE/KC explicitly want articulation that provides access and demystifies the process, while also repeatedly naming the danger that explanation turns into scaffolding, then calcifies into a recipe that collapses the very thing being described. The practice is compared to cleaning teeth: purposive and ordinary, but easy to distort if handled too aggressively.

## 13. “Good, not bad”: valence, safety and the non-heroic tone

There is a sustained attempt to avoid romanticising intensity. “Benign” and “everyday availability” are used to resist framing the experience as bliss, peak or special state, because that framing feeds seeking and ego capture. At the same time, KC/SE do explicitly name it as “sustainable and healthy” and agree to reorient if it tips toward harm.
