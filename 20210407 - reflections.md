# 20210407 - reflections

Started being a bit more precise about how I'm looking at footage, and what kinds of footage seems to be grabbing my interest. Created set of [[20210407 - key coding]] which might come in handy and started trying to assign colours to PP <20210325 - falling tests> -- specifically the last clip in that project <20_GOPR8101.MP4 15fps>.

Took another look at materials I shot in first day on [[20210308 - make a parachute]]. After getting so accustomed to watching in very slow motion was really struck by how much weight the camera seems to have. As if this real-time "normal" footage had been sped up.

I'm a bit torn about whether to push on with more camera-based experiments or to stay with the materials I've already shot. Start to understand them a bit more. Still such early days.
