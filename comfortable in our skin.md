# comfortable in our skin

Dear

I recently had endodontic therapy for the first time. Yes, that's right, a root canal. The endodontist was using a dental microscope (with magnification from 4 to 20x) and I spent a good chunk of the two hours wondering about the sensorial disconnect between him looking with magnified vision and using his hands in a very fine motor task. It's hard asking questions when one half of your mouth is anaesthetised, and you are stuck behind a dental dam. But damn it I did my best.

In 1934 the historian [Lewis Mumford wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technics_and_Civilization) that, "Without the use of glass for spectacles, mirrors, microscopes, telescopes, windows and containers, the modern world as realized by physics and chemistry could scarcely have been conceived." And I for one was grateful for this interface technology, this window into a small part of my body that had become infected twice in the last 3 months. 

Interfaces are fascinating things. The philosopher Alexander R. Galloway thinks that [interfaces are not simply objects or boundary points, but rather are processes](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Interface+Effect-p-9780745662527). I like this because it hints at the ways in which we tend to think of technological interfaces as objects when in reality (according to Galloway) they are zones of activity that make transformations happen. All well and very theoretical.

The other thing that happened while reclined in that chair was all that thinking about interfaces reminded me of watching someone on a train recently flicking rapidly through a dizzying number of TikToks. I have never installed TikTok on my phone (and nor will I) but it was kind of fun to watch the person make so many decisions so quickly as to how long to spend on each TikTok: the briefest of pauses, yes, no, back, definite no, yes, yes, no, yes. It's not unlike how quickly I can survey a table of nibbles: yes, yes, no, definitely no, maybe, oh what is _that_ and how did it get to be that kind of brown? We will always linger over the things that attract our attention. The [Wall Street Journal found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfczi2cI6Cs) that although shares, likes, follows and the things you watch play a role in determining one's FYP (For You Page) on TikTok, the platform needs only one piece of data to "figure you out": "how long you linger over a piece of content."

But I got worrying about that person and their TikToks. 

The self-described TikTok megafan [Freddie deBoer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_deBoer) is "totally unapologetic and proud about [his] love of the [TikTok] service" and yet [says](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/you-are-you-we-live-here-this-is): 

> what’s a TikTok that you still come back to, a year later, two years later, three? I think the honest answer is “none.” Because like so many other things in our culture, those videos are designed to be thrown away. They can’t hurt you, but they can’t move you. They’ll never challenge you, and they’ll never inspire you. All they’re meant to do is help you pass the seconds that make up your life, a finite and precious resource.

As I watched that young man and their TikToking it wasn't so much the content of the videos, or the rapidity of the decision-making that left me feeling unsettled (or perhaps "middle-aged"), it was more to do with the complexity of the transformations that were happening at that zone of activity, that interface: human, brain, eyes, ears, headphones, finger, screen, algorithm, videos. What was he doing? What was being done to him? Whatever transformations were happening they appeared frictionless, completely without tension. He was one with the smartphone. 

In John Fectel's [writing about the Apple Vision Pro for The New Atlantis](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/in-your-face) he describes Apple's relentless efforts to eliminate friction:

> Most of us do not have a strong enough sense of the indispensability of the body to resist having yet another layer of ourselves peeled away and a device put on us instead. Most of us already have devices too close to us, and our digital persona feels too real, and too far from our physical life, to resist the closing circle of each new epochal device. We need to get comfortable in our own skin again.

 As I lay there, reclined, alert to the strangeness of the whole root canal process, I did indeed feel comfortable in my skin. As my body was being acted upon drilled into so directly and loudly and with such precision, I was reassured by the solidity of my weight, my skin, and the pressure of my heart beating. It was a deeply human (dare I say "embodied") moment under very alien conditions and it felt precious. It felt transformative. And it felt riddled with friction.

> Interfaces are not simply objects or boundary points. They are autonomous zones of activity. Interfaces are not things, but rather processes that effect a result of whatever kind. For this reason I will be speaking not so much about particular inter- face objects (screens, keyboards), but interface effects.[@galloway-2012-interface p.vii]
