# comfortable in our skin

Dear

Bear with me, this month's writing is a bit of a ride ... 

I recently had endodontic therapy for the first time. Yes, that's right, a root canal. The endodontist was using a dental microscope (with magnification from 4 to 20x) and I spent a good chunk of the two hours wondering about the sensorial disconnect between him looking with magnified vision while using his hands in a very fine motor task. It's hard asking questions when one half of your mouth is anaesthetised, and you are stuck behind a dental dam. But damn it I did my best.

In 1934 the historian Lewis Mumford wrote that, "Without the use of glass for spectacles, mirrors, microscopes, telescopes, windows and containers, the modern world as realized by physics and chemistry could scarcely have been conceived." And I for one was grateful for this interface technology, this window into a small part of my body that had become infected twice in the last 3 months. 

Interfaces are fascinating things. The philosopher Alexander R. Galloway wrote how interfaces are not simply objects or boundary points, but rather are processes [@galloway-2012-interface p.vii] I like this because at hints at the ways in which we tend to reduce technologies to being objects when in reality they are zones of activity that make transformations happen. 

TikTok is the inevitable consequences of device paradigm logic. It is cheap (free), available and easy. TikTok is also a site on which a lot of dance happens. It is dance. How to make sense of 


  

"Ask a TikTok megafan, someone who’s totally unapologetic and proud about their love of the service: what’s a TikTok that you still come back to, a year later, two years later, three? I think the honest answer is “none.” Because like so many other things in our culture, those videos are designed to be thrown away. They can’t hurt you, but they can’t move you. They’ll never challenge you, and they’ll never inspire you. All they’re meant to do is help you pass the seconds that make up your life, a finite and precious resource." (Freddie deBoer, You Are You. We Live Here. This is Now.)

> Most of us do not have a strong enough sense of the indispensability of the body to resist having yet another layer of ourselves peeled away and a device put on us instead. Most of us already have devices too close to us, and our digital persona feels too real, and too far from our physical life, to resist the closing circle of each new epochal device. We need to get comfortable in our own skin again. To do this, we need courage and optimism.

> Interfaces are not simply objects or boundary points. They are autonomous zones of activity. Interfaces are not things, but rather processes that effect a result of whatever kind. For this reason I will be speaking not so much about particular inter- face objects (screens, keyboards), but interface effects.[@galloway-2012-interface p.vii]
